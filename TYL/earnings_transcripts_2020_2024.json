Your host for today\u2019s call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 10, 2021.  I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Moore. Please go ahead.\nLynn Moore: Thank you, Grant, and welcome to our call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. As you have seen, in addition to our fourth quarter earnings, we made another very significant announcement this morning. So we have a lot to talk about today. I\u2019d like to point out that we posted on our Investor Relations website and filed with our 8-K, a presentation on the acquisition and we will refer to some of those slides later in the call. First, I\u2019d like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, I will have some preliminary comments on our fourth quarter results and Brian will review the details. After that, we will return to our announcement today of our agreement to acquire NIC Inc. I will have some comments on the proposed acquisition and then we will take questions.\nBrian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company\u2019s future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause the actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. Our team executed well in a challenging environment during the fourth quarter and we concluded 2020 with solid earnings and record cash flows. Recurring revenues, which comprise 75% of our fourth quarter revenues were strong, led by a 17% growth in subscription revenues. However, software licenses and services revenues continue to be pressured by longer sales cycles and delays in projects, as clients deal with the effects of the pandemic, along with the near elimination of billable travel. Our revenue mix and cost efficiencies contributed to 120-basis-point expansion of our non-GAAP operating margin to 26.9%. Cash flow has been very robust throughout the year and both cash from operations and free cash flow ended the year strong and grew 16.5% and 25.8%, respectively. This was our highest fourth quarter and full year cash flow ever, and for the year, free cash flow grew 53.6% to $326.6 million. Bookings for the quarter were relatively flat with the prior year at approximately $333 million. Our largest deal of the quarter, which was also the largest single contract in our history, was a five-year extension of our e-filing arrangement with the Texas Office of Court Administration valued at approximately $98 million. The extension also included e-filing insights, a Socrata-based interactive reporting layer that eliminates hundreds of hours of manual reporting activities and gets clerks in all 254 counties, the ability to monitor 50,000 daily filings, so they can identify bottlenecks inefficiencies and improve the experience for the public. However, due to certain contract provisions, only a very small portion of the value of this contract was included in backlog and bookings. If the entire value of this contract had been included in backlogs, bookings growth for the fourth quarter would have been approximately 28%. Our largest new SaaS deal in the fourth quarter was with Jackson County, Missouri, for our iasWorld appraisal and tax solution, as well as Appraisal Services valued at approximately $18 million. Other significant contract signed this quarter included a multi-suite license arrangement for our Munis ERP, EnerGov civic services and Socrata Data Insights solutions, with the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands valued at approximately $5 million. SaaS agreements with the city of Jacksonville, Florida for EnerGov civic services solution and with Stark County, Ohio for our public safety solutions, each valued at approximately $4 million. And 10 SaaS deals and three license contracts for various Tyler solutions, each valued at over $1 million. Brian will discuss our guidance for 2021, but I\u2019d like to update you on some of our plans surrounding our strategic initiatives to accelerate our move to the cloud. Our 2021 plan includes accelerated and new cloud investments across the spectrum of our products. Our plan includes approximately $23 million of investments in cloud product development in 2021 and a total investment of more than $52 million over the next three years, with the majority of that expensed. As a result of these investments, we expect by the end of 2023, all of our major applications lead to be cloud native or cloud efficient for deployment at AWS. We have also made some organizational changes, some of which were announced earlier this week to focus additional leadership on our cloud initiatives, as well as streamlining internal technology and security operations and driving other technology efficiency objectives. Now, I\u2019d like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter.\nBrian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. This morning Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We have also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings backlog and recurring revenues. Our revenues continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $283.3 million, down 1.9%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $283.4 million, down 1.4%. Software license revenues declined 46%, reflecting both extended sales cycles and a very high mix of subscription deals at 73%. Software services revenues declined to 18%, as some projects slowed as a result of COVID-19 and our shift to remote delivery of most services also resulted in a $5 million decline in billable travel revenue. On the positive side, subscription revenues rose 17%. We added 118 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a quarterly high of 50 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. In Q4 of last year we added 164 new subscription-based arrangements and had 18 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $74 million in contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 73% of total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 54% in Q4 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.5 years, compared to 4.4 years last year. Revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions were $24.6 million, up 13.3%. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $15.5 million, up 5.1% and e-payments revenue of $9.1 million, up 30.6%. For the fourth quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue or ARR was approximately $850 million, up 10.4%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q4 was approximately $278 million, up 17.9%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $98 million, up 13.3% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $474 million, up 5.8%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.59 billion, up 9.4%. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were relatively flat at $333 million. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.3 billion, down 1.3%, against a tough comparison that included the two large North Carolina Courts deals totaling approximately $105 million in the prior trailing 12 months. If the full amount of the Texas e-filing extension had been included in our backlog, Q4 bookings would have grown 28% and trailing 12 month bookings would have grown 5.8%. Our software subscription bookings in the fourth quarter added $11 million in new annual recurring revenue. The bookings growth rate was also affected by the shorter average term for new subscription contracts. As it was throughout the year, cash flow was robust in the fourth quarter as cash from operations increased 16.5% to $88.8 million and free cash flow grew 25.8% to $83.7 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $758 million in cash and investments, and no outstanding debt. Our earnings release has the full details of our 2021 guidance, which excludes the impact of NIC and any other acquisitions, which may be completed during the year. We expect to update our guidance to include the NIC transaction after it closes. With regard to revenue and earnings, we expect 2021 GAAP and non-GAAP revenues will both be between $1.190 billion and $1.220 billion, representing a range of growth from 6.6% to 9.3%. We expect 2021 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.03 and $4.21, and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on our GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.65 and $5.77, representing an increase of 2.4% to 4.5%. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 42.5 million and 43 million shares. As we look ahead to 2021, it\u2019s clear that we won\u2019t be back to normal for some time. We have said on prior calls that we anticipate that the impact of COVID-19 would continue into 2021 and our plan for this year anticipate this ongoing uncertainty. Nonetheless, we are excited about our opportunities to accelerate revenue growth and achieve our margin objectives for this year. Revenue growth while below our normal targets is expected to be significantly above the 2020 level. Just to refresh your memory, as we entered 2020, our guidance was for non-GAAP revenue growth of approximately 10% to 12% and for margins to be relatively flat with 2019 with an expectation of resuming our margin expansion trajectory in 2020. COVID-19 obviously resulted in the 2020 performance that was very different from our initial guidance, as we finished with low-single digit revenue growth and 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion. We have talked before about how some of the factors that led to margin improvement in 2020 are sustainable while others are not. Those factors include a favorable change in our revenue mix from a decline in low margin revenues like professional services and billable travel, as well as cost savings in areas like travel, marketing and employee healthcare. I\u2019d like to point out a few of the factors that are expected to impact our margins this year. Employee healthcare expense will have a significant impact on operating margins in 2021. During 2020, we saw an unexpected decline in our healthcare costs as the pandemic curtailed elective surgeries, checkups and much of our employees\u2019 non-urgent healthcare and our net health claims expense per employee declined 8.4% for the year. As those costs returned to normal pre-pandemic levels in 2021 coupled with inflation, we are expecting an increase of approximately $13 million or 21% over the reduced level in 2020. Also our diluted share count is expected to be 575,000 to 1.1 million shares higher than in 2020. We issued approximately 1.3 million shares under our stock compensation plans in 2020, including 1.2 million shares from the exercise of stock options granted in previous years. Our higher stock price also impacts the dilution calculation.  If our diluted share count in 2021 was the same as 2020, our non-GAAP EPS guidance would be about $0.18 higher. As a reminder, beginning in 2018, we began a shift in our long-term incentive equity to a mix of options restricted stock units and performance stock units. As that shift continues, we anticipate a significantly less dilutive impact of long-term stock incentives going forward. Our guidance implies operating margins that are modestly below the 2020 level, but above our 2019 operating margins. That trend is generally in line with the trajectory we targeted at the beginning of 2020 and if we achieve our plan, we will finish 2021 with margins in line with or above what we would have expected pre-pandemic. So, to conclude, our 2021 plan reflects a solid combination of organic revenue growth and strategic growth investments, especially around our cloud transition. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Lynn.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. As I look back on 2020, I marvel in how our team of professionals performed in the extraordinary environment of the last few months. We were laser focused on continuing to take care of our clients\u2019 needs as we always do, while taking care of each other at the same time and while our financial results certainly weren\u2019t what we expected at the start of the year, we adapted to the new realities of the pandemic with very good results. As I have said numerous times during last year, I couldn\u2019t be prouder to lead our incredible company and its people. While 2020 presented a myriad of challenges, we view many of those challenges as creating opportunities that Tyler is well positioned to take advantage of. Our financial position is stronger than it was a year ago with more than $800 million in cash and investments and no debt on our balance sheet today. We have been able to continue to invest in and in some cases accelerate all of our long-term strategic initiatives and they are all on track. As a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. We believe the pandemic will further accelerate the public sectors move to the cloud and we are in great position to support that move. Our client base is large and diverse, with more than 27,000 implementations and it represents our greatest asset for both future sales opportunities and the dependable revenue stream it produces, and we have a deep and experienced management team that has weathered difficult economic times in the past. All of these factors make us confident that we are exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize as markets return to normal. With that, I\u2019d like to turn to this morning\u2019s extremely exciting announcement that Tyler has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire NIC Inc. in all-cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion. We are going to spend a bit of time today walking you through why NIC is an exceptional addition to Tyler family and we will leave time at the end of the presentation for your questions. But before we begin, I will remind you that we have posted a presentation on the acquisition on our IR website and I will refer to some of the slides in my remarks. I would draw your attention to the disclosures on slide three related to solicitation materials and remind you that additional information is available on the websites of both Tyler and NIC. So, with that out of the way, I\u2019d like to start by highlighting the significant benefits of this acquisition, the largest in Tyler\u2019s history by a wide margin brings to our business. NIC is a leading digital solutions provider to state and federal government entities and will meaningfully increased Tyler\u2019s presence in both of those sectors, building on the entry points we achieved via acquisitions of MicroPact and Socrata a couple of years ago. NIC also brings to Tyler a very large incremental payments processing business for governments, allowing us to meaningfully grow our revenue stream that is highly recurring in nature. NIC\u2019s unique state-wide contract structure and complementary portfolio of offerings will allow Tyler to better serve a broader customer base with a more complete set of solutions. And perhaps most importantly, Tyler and NIC are two companies whose cultures are complementary and well-aligned, which I will touch on more in a moment. In terms of the transaction specifics, this is an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of $34 per share, which equates to an equity value of $2.3 billion or an enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion, inclusive of NIC balance sheet cash. We have committed financing to fund the transaction in the form of cash on hand and a $1.6 billion bridge facility, which we anticipate replacing with permanent capital between signing and closing. The transaction has been unanimously approved by both Boards of Directors and is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by the NIC shareholders. We expect this combination to be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings and EBITDA, as well as to our recurring revenue mix and free cash flow per share in the first year. It\u2019s important to note that we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet post transaction with a very reasonable balance of leverage and liquidity. I\u2019d like to briefly touch again on the point around culture and how that played into the rationale for this acquisition. NIC is a company that\u2019s been on Tyler\u2019s radar screen for quite some time and we have admired their reputation in the marketplace from a distance. As I and the rest of the Tyler management team got to know our counterpart NIC over the last few weeks and months, it became increasingly clear how similar our two organizations are, as you can see from the similarities in our respective missions. Tyler and NIC are two companies built on integrity and focused on delivering differentiated value for all of our respective constituents, governments, businesses, citizens, employees and shareholders. I view this combination as a continued realization of our mission of empowering the public sector to create smarter, safer and stronger communities. The pandemic has accelerated the shift by governments to online services and electronic payments as more citizens and businesses are interacting digitally with government. NIC is uniquely positioned with a deep expertise and robust digital solutions to partner with us in making government more efficient and more accessible to citizens. NIC\u2019s capabilities and vision align with are complementary to our connected communities vision and will advance our efforts to bring that to our clients. On slide six, we have included a bit more information on NIC, as well as some key relevant statistics. The company is a leading digital solutions and payments provider serving more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. NIC has enterprise-wide partnerships with 31 states and a robust payments business that currently processes $24 billion in payments annually and that amount will increase significantly with implementation of the payments processing contract NIC recently signed with the State of Florida. The company\u2019s broad set of solutions and a unique go-to-market contracting model allow NIC to become deeply embedded with their clients, resulting in predictable, highly recurring revenue growth. For the fiscal year ended 2020, NIC delivered revenue of more than $460.5 million and adjusted EBITDA of about $108.8 million. NIC\u2019s complete fourth quarter earnings were also released this morning and you will find their complete results on their website. On slide seven, you can see the breadth of NIC\u2019s leading portfolio of digital government solutions. At a high level, the company is focused on delivering user-friendly digital services that make it easier and more efficient to interact with government, providing valuable conveniences like applying for unemployment insurance, submitting business filings, renewing licenses, accessing information and making secure payments without visiting a government office. NIC serves both businesses and citizens with solutions to tackle information, interactions and payments for a wide range of government agencies, and importantly, including a variety of delivery methods such as Gov2Go. NIC\u2019s unique proprietary cross agency mobile platform designed specifically for citizens to interact with governments. We drill down a bit further into NIC\u2019s focus areas on slide eight, and importantly, how NIC\u2019s solutions map to our existing portfolio. As we assessed NIC\u2019s fit with Tyler, we thought about their portfolio of offerings through a number of lenses. Certain of NIC\u2019s end markets such as their solutions for businesses, courts and healthcare are highly complementary with Tyler\u2019s. NIC\u2019s presence in these sectors at the state and federal level are naturally aligned with Tyler\u2019s established presence at the local level. Other areas such as outdoor recreation and taxes represent natural adjacencies to expand Tyler\u2019s current business, while a sector like motor vehicles is a clear growth opportunity. The key takeaway from our assessment of NIC\u2019s portfolio is that there are a number of areas where Tyler\u2019s existing businesses will benefit from NIC quickly and were avenues of growth should open up organically for both of us over time. A similar fact pattern emerges, if you look at NIC\u2019s geographic footprint, which is shown on slide nine. NIC has established relationships across the nation including geographic alignment with Tyler in several complementary solution areas with 16 states where both companies have active contracts at different agencies. NIC\u2019s State Enterprise and Platform Solutions businesses, both of which we will touch on in greater detail in a moment, already have great breadth and depth, and we see a number of white space opportunities to expand these platforms as part of the Tyler portfolio. We also view NIC\u2019s federal client relationships as a natural fit to meaningfully expand our existing Tyler Federal business. On slide 10 we provide a more detailed overview of NIC\u2019s State Enterprise business, including a look at the long-term relationships the company has built over time. NIC\u2019s State Enterprise Solution offers a unique approach to working with governments by putting dedicated local teams in capital cities for support and developing services and solutions that are relevant to all agencies within a state government. NIC is able to deploy best practices gleaned over a number of decades and leverage a deep foundation of technological capabilities in tailoring solutions to fit specialized needs. The company\u2019s flexible state-wide contract vehicles allow governments to avoid cumbersome procurement processes by authorizing NIC to develop and implement a wide range of solutions across a number of different agencies. These long-term contracts lead to clear line of sight both operationally and from a revenue perspective, as evidenced by NIC\u2019s historic ability to grow same state revenue at 8% plus. NIC\u2019s Platform Solutions business, which is illustrated on slide 11 includes comprehensive agency-specific vertical solutions that are the product of significant investments NIC has made in recent years, both organically and inorganically and represent scalable solutions designed to address specific areas of market demand. On the payment side, NIC has built a comprehensive platform specifically designed for governments that can be integrated into state enterprise systems or offered standalone. Recently acquired solutions in licensing and healthcare are already showing early wins with new contracts awards across five states while NIC has successfully deployed various outdoor recreation solutions in 12 states. The early momentum in this piece of NIC\u2019s business is clearly evident and is very exciting for Tyler. We see significant opportunity to drive outsized growth with these platform technologies. Turning to slide 12, I would like to reiterate how strongly we believe in the merits of this transaction and view the addition of NIC as a combination of complementary strengths. With this acquisition we will create a public sector technology solutions leader that furthers our goal of connecting governments with constituents and businesses in a way that is seamless and transparent. I\u2019d close by noting how delighted we are to soon welcome NIC and their employees to the Tyler family. I remind you that we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of this year and is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approval by NIC stockholders. As a result, we are somewhat limited in our ability to discuss certain aspects of the transaction at this time. With that, we\u2019d like to open up the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nKirk Materne: Okay. Thanks very much and congratulations on the acquisition. Lynn, two questions I think for you predominantly. Just first on the, I guess, the backdrop right now in the Tyler business, are you hearing any sort of, I guess, green shoots coming from some of your clients yet in terms of their budgets. I guess these activity levels around the top end of the funnel. Just trying to get a sense on whether you see you guys -- if you see any sort of defrosting in the market a little bit? You said it\u2019s a nice deal this quarter but clearly it\u2019s still challenging. So how do you see that maybe playing out over \u201821? And then just on the NIC deal, clearly, seems like you are going to leave the business alone for at least the near-term. Can you just talk about some of the synergies maybe you see from a topline perspective at least as you look out over the next one year or two years maybe the one or two things that you think are maybe lower hanging fruit on that front? Thanks.\nLynn Moore: Yeah. Thanks, Kirk. On your first question around budgets and activity level, as we said going -- we said at the last quarterly call, our anticipation was that COVID would continue into 2021. As you recall, most of our clients, their budget seasons are June 30, so they are in the midst of those budgets. When you look back at 2020 and some of the comments I made during the year, the pandemic actually it was impacting different parts of our business a little bit differently. We saw a little more impact in our ERP space, particularly at the mid and higher end, and a little bit more in the appraisal and tax base. We actually had a really good sales year last year at courts and justice when they talk about that a little bit later was actually a record sales year for them. But the number of RFPs and demos and all that slowed down really impacted certain parts of our business more. And it\u2019s just anecdotal right now. We are now just one month into 2021, but in -- what we have seen a little bit, particularly on the ERP side, we don\u2019t talk about awards and wins, but the awards in January and the contract values was something that\u2019s certainly up over the last eight months and is a positive sign. We see things over and like in the appraisal and tax area where there are some fairly significant projects, some fairly large RFPs that really got put on the shelf in Q2 of last year. We are starting to see those starting to come out again, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean mini contracts, as you know, or immediate deals, but we are seeing some of that. There is still going to be headwinds in 2021, obviously, with the COVID relief that just passed, there is some uncertainty about what that\u2019s going to mean. We are still seeing pushes and delays. But I think at your comment about defrosting, I kind of getting an early sense, but again it\u2019s anecdotal right now. I think we will know a lot more obviously at the end of Q1 and as the vaccine rolls out and people start getting more comfortable, I think, we will start getting better clear site on that. On the NIC front, I just want to say a couple of things, I have mentioned in the opening remarks, a couple of times now about stockholder approval and regulatory approval. There are certain things I can say right now and certain things I can\u2019t. I am going to air right now on the conservative side, because this is a big deal and I am so excited, and the last thing I want to do is overstep my bounds on this call with my excitement and do something to potentially jeopardize this transaction. I can tell you that we see a lot of revenue opportunities, lot of revenue opportunities for NIC and lot of revenue opportunities for Tyler. It\u2019s going to take some time just like all of our acquisitions. As you know you followed us a long time where we are a good acquirer, we bring companies in, we take our time. Our first model is make sure we don\u2019t break the great company that they have built. We are going to sit down with them and really map out sort of what those opportunities are and what\u2019s the best timeline to achieve them, while also keeping their strong business intact. I can just tell you that when we look at those and we look at how are the complementary nature of our businesses and the ability to utilize some of their state-wide contracts and what they are doing in payments and what we can learn from them and what they might can learn from us. It\u2019s pretty exciting. And I think, I really look forward to sharing a lot more detail as it goes on. But I am going to try to keep my comments at pretty high level at this point.\nKirk Materne: Got it. Thanks, Lynn.\nLynn Moore: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Keith Housum. He is with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Yeah. Lynn congratulations on the acquisition. As you guys know I cover NIC and they are a quality company with some really good people there. So great job there. Just I completely respect the limits that you have on in terms of talking about the deal. But just to be clear though, you guys see this clear -- clearly from a revenue synergy standpoint as opposed to any type of significant cost cutting synergies, correct?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. That\u2019s absolutely correct, Keith. And I think that\u2019s our history at Tyler is. We -- when we pursue an acquisition for strategic purposes and it\u2019s not to go in quote create synergies through cost, it\u2019s about how we are going to invest and grow that business and align it with ours. You have seen that throughout other Tyler acquisitions and it\u2019s one of the things I am most proud of. And in fact I mentioned in Kirk\u2019s response how C&J last year really had a record year in sales and a lot of that has to do with the fact of the acquisitions we have done over the years and how we have integrated them and opened up new markets and aligned them with our business and that\u2019s exactly what we see with the NIC acquisition. It\u2019s a great company, as you mentioned. It\u2019s the company built on integrity. They have got a great management team, really strong management team as you would expect and we are just really excited about bringing them into the Tyler fold and getting to work together.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thanks. Maybe if I just turn it over to Tyler business in the fourth quarter, so clearly software licenses, I guess, no real surprise there, some delays are still continuing. Is there a point in 2021 or maybe even 2022 that we are actually going to see the release of some pent-up demand or is it the ability by the clients that sweat their assets where they probably won\u2019t it would be more blood in. How can we kind of think about a recovery from COVID? I hope that as a return to a more normalized world toward the end of the year?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. I think, obviously, it\u2019s a little hard to nail down. As we said before on calls the demand didn\u2019t go away. I mean, everything we do is we provide a central functionality essential services, it\u2019s there. And what we have seen for example and what I have talked about in the past, I have mentioned that last year, maybe a little bit more difficult year on sales in our mid to upper level ERP space. That\u2019s really just a more reflection of people being able to hang on with their systems for another year and sort of sweat it out and it\u2019s my expectation that that pent-up demand will be released. It\u2019s hard to predict exactly when. And again, what we have talked about over the last year is, we really lean back on our experience back during the great recession. Well, it\u2019s not -- it\u2019s really not apples to apples, there is a lot of similarities and what we saw there was sort of a depressed market for a couple of years, but then that market open up. And it\u2019s sort of exploded and the fact that we were able to invest and improve our competitive position really put us in a great position to capitalize on that and that\u2019s the way we feel about it now. We are just as optimistic about the future as I was coming into 2020.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thanks. Appreciate it. Good luck.\nLynn Moore: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Peter Heckmann. He is with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nPeter Heckmann: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen, and let me echo those congratulations. I have covered you guys since 2005 and I agree there is a very nice complementary fit here both culturally and from a business perspective and so I think it\u2019s going to going to be a nice deal. I know you don\u2019t want to talk too much about the details, but could you let us know, is there a go shop provision with the deal any type of termination fees involved? And then just back of the envelope, it looks like the deal might get you to around 2.5 times levered post-deal. Is that about the right ballpark?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. Pete, and again, thanks for the comments on NIC. We couldn\u2019t agree more on the cultural fit and I want to spend a second on that before I get to your other questions is, we have done a lot of acquisitions over the years and the one thing that we have learned and one thing we primarily look for is cultural alignment. Because in our experience acquisitions can -- they can look great on paper and they can look great in banker books and all that stuff that you see. But really it doesn\u2019t matter if the cultures are aligned, it just doesn\u2019t matter how good it looks on paper, they just ultimately won\u2019t work out and that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s so exciting about this. And as I have spent time with Harry, their CEO, and as we got to know their management team, just seeing their culture and seeing the way they approach the business and how it aligned with us and their vision. That\u2019s just a very key point. As it relates to the agreement itself, I believe the agreement got filed or will be filed today. So as you talk about no shop provisions and termination fees, those are all fairly standard negotiated provisions that you will see in these sorts of public company deals. I would say, the terms of those in this agreement are somewhat typical. I will let you go look those up in the side on those. But, yeah, they are fairly typical and things that you would expect to see in a stock transaction. On the financing front, I am glad you raised that. We have talked about forever our strong balance sheet and you are right. When you look at a net debt to EBITDA ratio, we believe it\u2019s going to be pretty manageable, maybe somewhere in the 3 times, the high 2s, low 3s, but somewhere around there will be pretty reasonable. The one thing I want to specifically emphasize as well, this is significant amount of debt and it\u2019s something that we haven\u2019t carried for a long time. It\u2019s my goal and my anticipation as we move to more committed financing that we are going to maintain a lot of flexibility and we are going to -- our balance sheet is still going to look very strong. It\u2019s one of the things I am committed to doing and putting this permanent financing together. I spoke to our Board about it two days ago. It\u2019s really important that how we structure this debt allows us to continue to do the things that we have done so successfully for so many years and have been a big part of our success. Things like the flexibility to continue and invest in all of our R&D initiatives that continue to do acquisitions as they arise and opportunistic share repurchases. It\u2019s my anticipation that we will still have that flexibility over the next several years as we work with the debt and I believe to be very manageable. So I appreciate that question.\nPeter Heckmann: Great. Great. That\u2019s fair. And then just as a quick follow-up, in terms of the main buckets of government federal, state, your city and -- cities and towns, are you seeing one of those that, I would assume federal has maybe some less significant budget restrictions at this point. And so are you seeing a little bit better activity there like for a MicroPact or a Socrata then you would maybe at this level, just given the need for balanced budgets at the state level?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. So it\u2019s interesting, I\u2019d actually -- throughout 2020 that was really more the case. There was probably a little more pressure on the state budgets than there was at the federal level and we saw that with our MicroPact and Socrata solutions. As we got into the fourth quarter and as actually state budgets have started to stabilize, we are actually starting to see the shift right now. And as we look into 2021, we see the state budgets actually starting to come back and opportunity starting to open up. And actually right now, at the federal level, it\u2019s a little bit more cautious, I wouldn\u2019t -- cautious maybe the wrong word, but it\u2019s really has more to do with the change in administration. And so there will probably be a little bit of a pause there on deals. We saw there were some deals in Q4 once the election happened and you get a change in administration, you get change in organization, leadership and priorities. There is just a little bit of a pause. But I would expect as the year continues to roll out and particularly with some of the initiatives that we are seeing come out at a Congress that\u2019s going to pick back up as the year goes on.\nPeter Heckmann: Great. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nScott Berg: Hi, Lynn and Brian. Congrats on the acquisition and thanks for taking my questions. I guess, kind of two here, Lynn, starting with the acquisition is, I haven\u2019t covered NIC, obviously, looked at them from a far and this probably ends a 10-year rumor that you guys might ultimately quite hear them. But on their business at least from how I understand it a little bit, correct me if I am wrong. But some of their state and federal opportunities have a little bit more of a custom software kind of component to it, the pure pre-packaged software, which is predominantly what Tyler sells today. How do you deal with that going forward or is that kind of maybe a miss -- misconception in terms of what their products may look like to those larger customers?\nLynn Moore: I\u2019d say, Scott, and I think, that was probably more their business model when they started. It\u2019s obviously there is still a part of that I think what they have been doing is they have been evolving their business to make it less custom and to make it more leverageable across their client base. You are also seeing what they have done the last several years where they have started to get some more vertical solutions. They have done a couple of small acquisition and starting to push those. I mean, I think, part of their overall growth plan absent Tyler, was to sort of continue to move in that direction and that\u2019s the direction they are moving on and we would expect that to continue.\nScott Berg: Got it. Helpful. And then, I guess, congratulations to Jeff for leading the new accelerated move to your cloud platform. But I guess, as we think about that movements at the end of 2023 is only roughly a three years weight to have all your apps to be cloud native or I guess cloud efficient is just kind of a two-part question there is. First, how do we think about margin structure and what the new platform looks like, now that you are getting more visibility around kind of time frames, etc., gross margin structure obviously on those customers? And then two, how do you migrate those customers. Is this something that you try to push relatively quickly to get some of your current subscription based customers to move over that or do you allow them to kind of naturally migrate there over a longer timeframe? Thanks.\nLynn Moore: Yeah. Thanks, Scott. I think, it\u2019s going to be a mix of a little bit of both and part of it is, as we think about going through a cloud transformation -- really the cloud transformation at Tyler. And as you know, that\u2019s more than just getting your products into a certain state. It eventually really impacts the way not just how you develop products but how you deploy and support them. Part of that strategy, as you mentioned is, migrating our customers out of the Tyler systems and moving them over to AWS. The principal foundational piece of that though is, is making sure that our products as we move them over there that they operate in at least an efficient if not more efficient way than they are in the current Tyler cloud centers and that\u2019s what we are operating on now. I think you will see over and we talk about over the next three years, that doesn\u2019t mean all of them are all going to suddenly be magically there at December 31, 2023. It will be getting there in different stages along the way, some sooner than others. And I think as we go forward and we think about those plans, you will start to see us develop plans where perhaps new customers are all going into the AWS world. You will see certain areas where our products already are more cloud efficient or closer that we will become more aggressive with our existing customers and so it\u2019s going to be a little bit of blend and a mix. And that\u2019s also part of why we created this group. I mean, this group was created for a number of reasons. It\u2019s very exciting. Jeff, as you mentioned he\u2019s been here almost 30 years, he knows our business inside now. He is the perfect guy to oversee and coordinate and that\u2019s really part of what this role is. It\u2019s a Tyler-wide, company-wide coordination of all of these multiple streams that you are talking about. It\u2019s not just getting our products there. It\u2019s getting our plans on migration. It\u2019s getting plans on getting out to Tyler datacenters. It\u2019s improving our IT infrastructure and making information security standard discipline. It\u2019s all the things it starting to build. How we are going to deploy and support and all of that and so it\u2019s a comprehensive effort. And you will -- we will continue to talk more about it each quarter, each -- every three months, six months, and we will talk about the progress and as these plans evolve and they get a little more specific. But at a high level that\u2019s where it is. And Brian, we have talked before on the margins as we move people into the cloud world. We expect significant margin improvement and significant revenue improvement both getting them on the subscription. But then also getting our products more cloud efficient will help margins getting to where we have fewer releases and they are deployed easier, it will help margins. Everything that\u2019s all about the cloud transformation and that\u2019s all going to help over the coming years.\nScott Berg: Great. Congrats again. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Charlie Strauzer with CJS Securities. Please go ahead.\nCharlie Strauzer: Hi. Good morning. Couple of quick questions for you. Lynn, you were talking about the balance sheet structure post the transaction and the type of debt you wanted to take on. Are you thinking more in terms of like a term loan or credit facility where you could use your strong free cash flow to quickly pay down the debt?\nBrian Miller: Hi, Charlie. This is Brian. We are actually considering a number of alternatives there. So we are not ready to quite specify one. But it\u2019s clear that the way interest rates are, the way some of the specific debt markets are, it\u2019s a very, very attractive time for a company with our profile with the transaction as financially compelling as this one to be looking to raise their debt. And so, we have got a lot of options, as Lynn said, maintaining flexibility and not limiting our ability to execute on other initiatives is key in that decision. But you will see more about that in the next few weeks from us.\nCharlie Strauzer: Excellent. Thanks. And then just looking at NIC\u2019s performance in 2020, you clearly had some benefits from some new programs they have rolled out for COVID-related things. What -- how should we think about kind of the longer term growth aspects for the topline of that business? Clearly, there is kind of more low-single digits prior to 2020. But help us think about how we should think about that business going forward?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. Charlie, I\u2019d say two things. You are right. They definitely get a boost in 2020 on some specific COVID pandemic-related products and some initiatives around there. What I\u2019d say to that is, that really shows their innovation and ingenuity and it shows their ability to spin up something quickly to meet the needs and to roll it out really quickly. And in my -- the way I view it is, while that was -- it\u2019s something that was really tied to the pandemic, that\u2019s something that is exciting to see that they can execute on that and to think that we can do things like that in other areas, particularly as we combine with some of the Tyler products. As you look at their overall revenue growth moving forward. I would say, my expectation is it would be more in line with Tyler\u2019s and when you look over the last couple of years. You -- if you look at it sort of in isolation on our 10-K or something, it may look like their overall revenue growth may have been lower. Part of that was the fact that there was a significant contract that they inherited, it wasn\u2019t when they originally sold with the State of Texas and when they lost that that was a significant headwind to year-over-year revenue growth. They have got a number of initiatives inside their business that will be growing at accelerated rates, just like we do at Tyler, some of these specific solution initiatives. I think you are going to see significant growth in their payments business. They -- as I mentioned on my opening remarks, they have recently won the contract with the State of Florida to not only provide state-wide payments across the State, but also it provides opportunities under that contract to do payments at the local level. So that\u2019s kind of at a high level the way I see it right now.\nBrian Miller: And I\u2019d also add that over the last decade their same-state revenue growth has been more than 8%, so over a long period of time. That\u2019s been reasonably close to sort of what our organic growth rate has been. So they do have really solid foundation of consistent growth and more than 90% recurring revenues. So that will actually raise our mix in terms of recurring revenues on a combined basis.\nCharlie Strauzer: Great. Thank you very much. Congratulations.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Vanvliet with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nMatt Vanvliet: Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions guys and congrats on the announcement. I guess, on the core business and maybe also how it relates to the acquisition. Curious on how much success in some of these larger deals especially the State of Texas extension. You feel like the Socrata data layer is enabling especially as everything kind of moves more digitally. I guess, how much are those conversations happening on a deal by deal basis? And then looking at NIC, how quickly do you think you can sort of integrate that and start pushing especially at the state layer where maybe greater visibility is even more paramount?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. On your first comment, you are right. Obviously, we -- the State of Texas contract was an extension of our previous relationship. We have done a lot of things there with the state to build in a lot of value to help our ability to recapture that contract and there is other upsides that come with that contract. One of the things that I have talked about over the last couple of quarters and it certainly haven\u2019t heard, yeah, Socrata plays a role. It\u2019s another value add that we do. But we all sort of seeing Socrata play a role in areas all across our company. And when we purchased Socrata, I guess, that was back in 2018, one of the things that we really liked about it is, not only do we believe that the future public sector is it will be have a focus around data and insights, but how it can really differentiate our products going forward. And I have talked about in public safety deals, we are starting to talk about it in our ERP deals. It\u2019s making a big difference. It\u2019s hard to quantify. But when we have that kind of functionality and that kind of insights and our competitors don\u2019t, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s a huge add and it\u2019s something that\u2019s a big differentiator. As it relates to quote integration of NIC, again, we are still vary in the early stages of that and we still have a lot of conversations to have with their management team. This deal, while it\u2019s been sort of going on in the back works for, I think, I first reached out to Harry back in September and -- but things have been accelerating and we have talked a lot about the opportunities. But we have got a lot of work to do to get our teams, their teams together and start thinking about those things. Some of those are still going to be a little bit limited again because of regulatory restraints. But all I can tell you and continue to emphasize is, how excited I am, how excited our team is and I believe how excited their team is for the opportunities that we have that we can go out there and do together when we combine these two leadership roles.\nMatt Vanvliet: Great. And on the transaction side, continuing to see strong growth there, I\u2019d say, I imagine that\u2019s a fairly high demand factor for a lot of local governments now. But from a competitive front, are you seeing maybe non-traditional vendors in terms of this area of the market enter in as a lot more kind of digital payments or FinTech type companies are looking to reach further into other areas of the market. So curious what you are seeing from the trends there and maybe how much that influenced the exact timing of getting this transaction done?\nLynn Moore: So, I would say that, there is a little bit of that. I think what we always want to differentiate even with this transaction base, just like I talked about in our core applications we differentiate with data and insights is the ability not just to do quote payment processing, but to be able to link those services with other offerings and things we do another and value adds. So that we really become more intertwined and tied with these government agencies. I mean, when -- you are right, when I look out to the future and I look to the future of the public sector market. I see the things like cloud and the provision of subscription-based essential functionality. It\u2019s digital services. It\u2019s transaction-based revenues. It\u2019s data and insights. It\u2019s our Connected Communities vision and it\u2019s bringing all of that stuff together in a way that really nobody else can. And so, yeah, to your question, there is a little bit of that, but we want to make sure that we get in there and add all these extra values and services to our clients that nobody else can deliver.\nMatt Vanvliet: Great. Thank you. Congrats.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Ho: Good morning. I just wanted to maybe start out with, understanding, I guess, why is now sort of the right time for the EGOV acquisition given that you have known them for a little bit of time and how does that sort of, I guess, mesh with your M&A strategy like do we sort of see a slowdown in activity. I think you said you wanted to maintain flexibility, but when we think about digestion of something this large, how should we be sort of probably think about that?\nLynn Moore: It\u2019s a good question, Jonathan. And it\u2019s funny, as you know, I have been with Tyler since 1998, EGOV or NIC went public a year later. Obviously, they have been in business for several years before that and literally, they have been on our radar since the day when they went public. We have had internal conversations about them over the years. I would say that part of it is we have been so focused on our mission of getting really all the essential functional areas across local government. As I have said before, we talked about this, we did the MicroPact acquisition even Socrata, its areas that we have always been interested in, but we just haven\u2019t gotten there. I can\u2019t tell you why I didn\u2019t specifically pick up the phone and call Harry three years ago as opposed to this fall. But I can tell you that we spent a lot of time and a lot of work on it even before I made that call. And again we have had conversations for a long time and their business has grown and matured, our business has grown and matured and as we have grown and gotten more solutions and more opportunities and as they have grown and increased their footprint, we really see the balance. And when you look at things like the prior question on payments, this is a big strategic driver for us and it\u2019s a big strategic driver for them and they have got a very significant payments business, we have got an emerging payments business and we see the opportunities there. So it\u2019s just one of those things. But all I can say is we are very excited that we have made this deal that we have made today now. As you talk about our M&A strategy going forward, I would be surprised if this is the only acquisition we do this year. But this is also a big acquisition. It\u2019s going to require a lot of focus on our management teams and this is something we need to get right. And so I could see at some point particularly after this deal closes as we go into the second half of the year that sort of like we were back in 2019 where we may take a little bit of deliberate pause. But as I mentioned, we are going to have the financial wherewithal to continue to capitalize on acquisition opportunities and we are going to continue to look like we always have and I continue -- I expect that will continue to be part of our roadmap going forward, as we continue to see strategic products are ways to increase our TAM or expand our offerings in areas where we already have a large footprint. So our overall strategy won\u2019t change at all. Again, it will probably as we get to the second of the year, a little bit more like 2019.\nJonathan Ho: Got it. And just as a quick follow-up, you talked about your competitive position strengthening throughout the downturn. Can you give us some concrete examples or some, I guess, greater detail in terms of what you are seeing in the competitive landscape and maybe where you are seeing some folks drop off?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. So, I\u2019d say, first of all, just initially it goes back to all of our investments and continue to invest in those. And what we have seen in the market is that some of our competitors are not making the investments that they may have historically done and we have seen a little bit of that. But when we see things like in our Incode Group, which is really the lower end of ERP it\u2019s where our schools is, it\u2019s where utility billing and things like that. That group right now are seeing record win rates. I mean, their win rates are approaching 90%, which is just off the chart and so we get really excited about when we think about the market returning. When we see things like I mentioned earlier on the call, our Courts & Justice Group. 2020 was actually the highest sales year for our Courts & Justice Division. Now, they are POC accounting, so it\u2019s not all going to flow in right away. But you remember back in 2014, 2015 when that group had really high sales which is when California opened up. That\u2019s a process of, I mean, not only our Odyssey continues to be strong, but all the investments we have made around there and the expanded products including acquisitions which was your question earlier and being able to sell all those products and have more functionality and be more competitive. We talk about the public safety. Public safety had another 1 million plus license deal this quarter. They are just on a roll. They had a very big win in Genesee County, Michigan against Motorola and CentralSquare. And again, that\u2019s a result of our competitiveness, our ability to check more boxes on the RFPs, our ability to go up market. And again all these acquisitions that are differentiating these offerings, so those are few examples and we just like where we sit right now and we anxiously await for pre-pandemic market.\nJonathan Ho: Congrats on the acquisition. Thank you.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Jon.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please go ahead.\nRob Oliver: Great. Thank you. Good morning, guys. Appreciate it. Lynn, I had one for you and then, Brian, a follow up for you. So, Lynn, I guess, a follow up on Scott Berg\u2019s question earlier, just around the details on the SaaS migration. Very helpful color there. I did note in the quarter that conversions were up nicely. So can you talk a little bit about that how you are managing that go-to-market and obviously you guys since your pivot to a subscription-first mindset has really been predominantly landing with subscription, with new business. But it does seem like conversions are starting to kick up nicely there. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. I think part of that conversion is also just the general market and as we said for a couple of years, the market was moving in this direction, certainly, COVID, I think is accelerating that. We are doing some things internally. It is a focus point for us. I think, one of our greatest opportunities is our existing customer base, whether it\u2019s new products that go in there, whether it\u2019s converting them to the SaaS model, continue to push in, inside sales continue to be one of our big growth drivers and so it\u2019s a combination of a lot of things. But you are right, it\u2019s a focus of ours and as we continue to get our products into a more cloud efficient state, it will become even more of a focus and even more pronounced. And it\u2019s going to take some time, I mean, I don\u2019t want to say this is all going to happen in the next few quarters, but it\u2019s going to take some time, but it\u2019s definitely the direction we are moving and it\u2019s a significant opportunity.\nRob Oliver: Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Brian, on the deal that you guys announced this quarter that extension on the Texas Office of Court Admin. Maybe if you could provide some color on what is it within this contract that did not enable you to show that in bookings and backlog and what are the measuring points that we are going to look to see that start to roll into the numbers?\nBrian Miller: Yeah. It\u2019s basically a form of a termination for convenience provision that\u2019s in the contract both neither we nor the State of Texas expect those to be exercised. The state has made some very positive comments about the relationship they have had with Texas as we provided e-filing services for the last few years and made enhancements and so we won that renewal in a very competitive process and with some enhancements to it. It also has I believe five one-year extensions on the end of the -- this five one-year opportunities to extend it. But because there are some termination for convenience provisions that we wouldn\u2019t expect to be exercised. From an accounting perspective, they prevent us from being able to put the full amount in backlog like we normally would with a fixed fee e-filing arrangement. So, I think, there is only, less than $5 million of that contract will go into backlog sort of each quarter. So doesn\u2019t affect revenues but it clearly affects the OpEx. We have talked over a long time about the lumpiness of some of the bookings. But this one -- was one that just didn\u2019t quite fit with the accounting provisions. But it\u2019s a great extension, a great testament to the work we have done with Texas over the last few years. It\u2019s clearly our biggest e-filing arrangement and getting that extension is a major win for us.\nRob Oliver: Great. Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Lynn.\nLynn Moore: Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Moore, I will turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nLynn Moore: Thanks. Thanks everybody for joining us today. We hope you continue to stay safe and healthy, and if you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to me or Brian Miller. Thanks again.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn? Thanks, Lynn. This morning Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2020. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We have also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings backlog and recurring revenues. Our revenues continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $283.3 million, down 1.9%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $283.4 million, down 1.4%. Software license revenues declined 46%, reflecting both extended sales cycles and a very high mix of subscription deals at 73%. Software services revenues declined to 18%, as some projects slowed as a result of COVID-19 and our shift to remote delivery of most services also resulted in a $5 million decline in billable travel revenue. On the positive side, subscription revenues rose 17%. We added 118 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a quarterly high of 50 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. In Q4 of last year we added 164 new subscription-based arrangements and had 18 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $74 million in contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 73% of total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 54% in Q4 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.5 years, compared to 4.4 years last year. Revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions were $24.6 million, up 13.3%. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $15.5 million, up 5.1% and e-payments revenue of $9.1 million, up 30.6%. For the fourth quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue or ARR was approximately $850 million, up 10.4%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q4 was approximately $278 million, up 17.9%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $98 million, up 13.3% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $474 million, up 5.8%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.59 billion, up 9.4%. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were relatively flat at $333 million. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.3 billion, down 1.3%, against a tough comparison that included the two large North Carolina Courts deals totaling approximately $105 million in the prior trailing 12 months. If the full amount of the Texas e-filing extension had been included in our backlog, Q4 bookings would have grown 28% and trailing 12 month bookings would have grown 5.8%. Our software subscription bookings in the fourth quarter added $11 million in new annual recurring revenue. The bookings growth rate was also affected by the shorter average term for new subscription contracts. As it was throughout the year, cash flow was robust in the fourth quarter as cash from operations increased 16.5% to $88.8 million and free cash flow grew 25.8% to $83.7 million. We ended the quarter with approximately $758 million in cash and investments, and no outstanding debt. Our earnings release has the full details of our 2021 guidance, which excludes the impact of NIC and any other acquisitions, which may be completed during the year. We expect to update our guidance to include the NIC transaction after it closes. With regard to revenue and earnings, we expect 2021 GAAP and non-GAAP revenues will both be between $1.190 billion and $1.220 billion, representing a range of growth from 6.6% to 9.3%. We expect 2021 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.03 and $4.21, and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on our GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.65 and $5.77, representing an increase of 2.4% to 4.5%. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 42.5 million and 43 million shares. As we look ahead to 2021, it's clear that we won't be back to normal for some time. We have said on prior calls that we anticipate that the impact of COVID-19 would continue into 2021 and our plan for this year anticipate this ongoing uncertainty. Nonetheless, we are excited about our opportunities to accelerate revenue growth and achieve our margin objectives for this year. Revenue growth while below our normal targets is expected to be significantly above the 2020 level. Just to refresh your memory, as we entered 2020, our guidance was for non-GAAP revenue growth of approximately 10% to 12% and for margins to be relatively flat with 2019 with an expectation of resuming our margin expansion trajectory in 2020. COVID-19 obviously resulted in the 2020 performance that was very different from our initial guidance, as we finished with low-single digit revenue growth and 150 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion. We have talked before about how some of the factors that led to margin improvement in 2020 are sustainable while others are not. Those factors include a favorable change in our revenue mix from a decline in low margin revenues like professional services and billable travel, as well as cost savings in areas like travel, marketing and employee healthcare. I'd like to point out a few of the factors that are expected to impact our margins this year. Employee healthcare expense will have a significant impact on operating margins in 2021. During 2020, we saw an unexpected decline in our healthcare costs as the pandemic curtailed elective surgeries, checkups and much of our employees' non-urgent healthcare and our net health claims expense per employee declined 8.4% for the year. As those costs returned to normal pre-pandemic levels in 2021 coupled with inflation, we are expecting an increase of approximately $13 million or 21% over the reduced level in 2020. Also our diluted share count is expected to be 575,000 to 1.1 million shares higher than in 2020. We issued approximately 1.3 million shares under our stock compensation plans in 2020, including 1.2 million shares from the exercise of stock options granted in previous years. Our higher stock price also impacts the dilution calculation.  If our diluted share count in 2021 was the same as 2020, our non-GAAP EPS guidance would be about $0.18 higher. As a reminder, beginning in 2018, we began a shift in our long-term incentive equity to a mix of options restricted stock units and performance stock units. As that shift continues, we anticipate a significantly less dilutive impact of long-term stock incentives going forward. Our guidance implies operating margins that are modestly below the 2020 level, but above our 2019 operating margins. That trend is generally in line with the trajectory we targeted at the beginning of 2020 and if we achieve our plan, we will finish 2021 with margins in line with or above what we would have expected pre-pandemic. So, to conclude, our 2021 plan reflects a solid combination of organic revenue growth and strategic growth investments, especially around our cloud transition. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn. Hi, Charlie. This is Brian. We are actually considering a number of alternatives there. So we are not ready to quite specify one. But it's clear that the way interest rates are, the way some of the specific debt markets are, it's a very, very attractive time for a company with our profile with the transaction as financially compelling as this one to be looking to raise their debt. And so, we have got a lot of options, as Lynn said, maintaining flexibility and not limiting our ability to execute on other initiatives is key in that decision. But you will see more about that in the next few weeks from us. And I'd also add that over the last decade their same-state revenue growth has been more than 8%, so over a long period of time. That's been reasonably close to sort of what our organic growth rate has been. So they do have really solid foundation of consistent growth and more than 90% recurring revenues. So that will actually raise our mix in terms of recurring revenues on a combined basis. Yeah. It's basically a form of a termination for convenience provision that's in the contract both neither we nor the State of Texas expect those to be exercised. The state has made some very positive comments about the relationship they have had with Texas as we provided e-filing services for the last few years and made enhancements and so we won that renewal in a very competitive process and with some enhancements to it. It also has I believe five one-year extensions on the end of the -- this five one-year opportunities to extend it. But because there are some termination for convenience provisions that we wouldn't expect to be exercised. From an accounting perspective, they prevent us from being able to put the full amount in backlog like we normally would with a fixed fee e-filing arrangement. So, I think, there is only, less than $5 million of that contract will go into backlog sort of each quarter. So doesn't affect revenues but it clearly affects the OpEx. We have talked over a long time about the lumpiness of some of the bookings. But this one -- was one that just didn't quite fit with the accounting provisions. But it's a great extension, a great testament to the work we have done with Texas over the last few years. It's clearly our biggest e-filing arrangement and getting that extension is a major win for us."

            "name": "Lynn Moore",
            "content": "Thank you, Grant, and welcome to our call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. As you have seen, in addition to our fourth quarter earnings, we made another very significant announcement this morning. So we have a lot to talk about today. I'd like to point out that we posted on our Investor Relations website and filed with our 8-K, a presentation on the acquisition and we will refer to some of those slides later in the call. First, I'd like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, I will have some preliminary comments on our fourth quarter results and Brian will review the details. After that, we will return to our announcement today of our agreement to acquire NIC Inc. I will have some comments on the proposed acquisition and then we will take questions. Thanks, Brian. Our team executed well in a challenging environment during the fourth quarter and we concluded 2020 with solid earnings and record cash flows. Recurring revenues, which comprise 75% of our fourth quarter revenues were strong, led by a 17% growth in subscription revenues. However, software licenses and services revenues continue to be pressured by longer sales cycles and delays in projects, as clients deal with the effects of the pandemic, along with the near elimination of billable travel. Our revenue mix and cost efficiencies contributed to 120-basis-point expansion of our non-GAAP operating margin to 26.9%. Cash flow has been very robust throughout the year and both cash from operations and free cash flow ended the year strong and grew 16.5% and 25.8%, respectively. This was our highest fourth quarter and full year cash flow ever, and for the year, free cash flow grew 53.6% to $326.6 million. Bookings for the quarter were relatively flat with the prior year at approximately $333 million. Our largest deal of the quarter, which was also the largest single contract in our history, was a five-year extension of our e-filing arrangement with the Texas Office of Court Administration valued at approximately $98 million. The extension also included e-filing insights, a Socrata-based interactive reporting layer that eliminates hundreds of hours of manual reporting activities and gets clerks in all 254 counties, the ability to monitor 50,000 daily filings, so they can identify bottlenecks inefficiencies and improve the experience for the public. However, due to certain contract provisions, only a very small portion of the value of this contract was included in backlog and bookings. If the entire value of this contract had been included in backlogs, bookings growth for the fourth quarter would have been approximately 28%. Our largest new SaaS deal in the fourth quarter was with Jackson County, Missouri, for our iasWorld appraisal and tax solution, as well as Appraisal Services valued at approximately $18 million. Other significant contract signed this quarter included a multi-suite license arrangement for our Munis ERP, EnerGov civic services and Socrata Data Insights solutions, with the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands valued at approximately $5 million. SaaS agreements with the city of Jacksonville, Florida for EnerGov civic services solution and with Stark County, Ohio for our public safety solutions, each valued at approximately $4 million. And 10 SaaS deals and three license contracts for various Tyler solutions, each valued at over $1 million. Brian will discuss our guidance for 2021, but I'd like to update you on some of our plans surrounding our strategic initiatives to accelerate our move to the cloud. Our 2021 plan includes accelerated and new cloud investments across the spectrum of our products. Our plan includes approximately $23 million of investments in cloud product development in 2021 and a total investment of more than $52 million over the next three years, with the majority of that expensed. As a result of these investments, we expect by the end of 2023, all of our major applications lead to be cloud native or cloud efficient for deployment at AWS. We have also made some organizational changes, some of which were announced earlier this week to focus additional leadership on our cloud initiatives, as well as streamlining internal technology and security operations and driving other technology efficiency objectives. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter. Thanks, Brian. As I look back on 2020, I marvel in how our team of professionals performed in the extraordinary environment of the last few months. We were laser focused on continuing to take care of our clients' needs as we always do, while taking care of each other at the same time and while our financial results certainly weren't what we expected at the start of the year, we adapted to the new realities of the pandemic with very good results. As I have said numerous times during last year, I couldn't be prouder to lead our incredible company and its people. While 2020 presented a myriad of challenges, we view many of those challenges as creating opportunities that Tyler is well positioned to take advantage of. Our financial position is stronger than it was a year ago with more than $800 million in cash and investments and no debt on our balance sheet today. We have been able to continue to invest in and in some cases accelerate all of our long-term strategic initiatives and they are all on track. As a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. We believe the pandemic will further accelerate the public sectors move to the cloud and we are in great position to support that move. Our client base is large and diverse, with more than 27,000 implementations and it represents our greatest asset for both future sales opportunities and the dependable revenue stream it produces, and we have a deep and experienced management team that has weathered difficult economic times in the past. All of these factors make us confident that we are exceptionally well-positioned to capitalize as markets return to normal. With that, I'd like to turn to this morning's extremely exciting announcement that Tyler has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire NIC Inc. in all-cash transaction for a purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion. We are going to spend a bit of time today walking you through why NIC is an exceptional addition to Tyler family and we will leave time at the end of the presentation for your questions. But before we begin, I will remind you that we have posted a presentation on the acquisition on our IR website and I will refer to some of the slides in my remarks. I would draw your attention to the disclosures on slide three related to solicitation materials and remind you that additional information is available on the websites of both Tyler and NIC. So, with that out of the way, I'd like to start by highlighting the significant benefits of this acquisition, the largest in Tyler's history by a wide margin brings to our business. NIC is a leading digital solutions provider to state and federal government entities and will meaningfully increased Tyler's presence in both of those sectors, building on the entry points we achieved via acquisitions of MicroPact and Socrata a couple of years ago. NIC also brings to Tyler a very large incremental payments processing business for governments, allowing us to meaningfully grow our revenue stream that is highly recurring in nature. NIC's unique state-wide contract structure and complementary portfolio of offerings will allow Tyler to better serve a broader customer base with a more complete set of solutions. And perhaps most importantly, Tyler and NIC are two companies whose cultures are complementary and well-aligned, which I will touch on more in a moment. In terms of the transaction specifics, this is an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of $34 per share, which equates to an equity value of $2.3 billion or an enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion, inclusive of NIC balance sheet cash. We have committed financing to fund the transaction in the form of cash on hand and a $1.6 billion bridge facility, which we anticipate replacing with permanent capital between signing and closing. The transaction has been unanimously approved by both Boards of Directors and is expected to close in the second quarter, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by the NIC shareholders. We expect this combination to be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings and EBITDA, as well as to our recurring revenue mix and free cash flow per share in the first year. It's important to note that we will continue to maintain a strong balance sheet post transaction with a very reasonable balance of leverage and liquidity. I'd like to briefly touch again on the point around culture and how that played into the rationale for this acquisition. NIC is a company that's been on Tyler's radar screen for quite some time and we have admired their reputation in the marketplace from a distance. As I and the rest of the Tyler management team got to know our counterpart NIC over the last few weeks and months, it became increasingly clear how similar our two organizations are, as you can see from the similarities in our respective missions. Tyler and NIC are two companies built on integrity and focused on delivering differentiated value for all of our respective constituents, governments, businesses, citizens, employees and shareholders. I view this combination as a continued realization of our mission of empowering the public sector to create smarter, safer and stronger communities. The pandemic has accelerated the shift by governments to online services and electronic payments as more citizens and businesses are interacting digitally with government. NIC is uniquely positioned with a deep expertise and robust digital solutions to partner with us in making government more efficient and more accessible to citizens. NIC's capabilities and vision align with are complementary to our connected communities vision and will advance our efforts to bring that to our clients. On slide six, we have included a bit more information on NIC, as well as some key relevant statistics. The company is a leading digital solutions and payments provider serving more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. NIC has enterprise-wide partnerships with 31 states and a robust payments business that currently processes $24 billion in payments annually and that amount will increase significantly with implementation of the payments processing contract NIC recently signed with the State of Florida. The company's broad set of solutions and a unique go-to-market contracting model allow NIC to become deeply embedded with their clients, resulting in predictable, highly recurring revenue growth. For the fiscal year ended 2020, NIC delivered revenue of more than $460.5 million and adjusted EBITDA of about $108.8 million. NIC's complete fourth quarter earnings were also released this morning and you will find their complete results on their website. On slide seven, you can see the breadth of NIC's leading portfolio of digital government solutions. At a high level, the company is focused on delivering user-friendly digital services that make it easier and more efficient to interact with government, providing valuable conveniences like applying for unemployment insurance, submitting business filings, renewing licenses, accessing information and making secure payments without visiting a government office. NIC serves both businesses and citizens with solutions to tackle information, interactions and payments for a wide range of government agencies, and importantly, including a variety of delivery methods such as Gov2Go. NIC's unique proprietary cross agency mobile platform designed specifically for citizens to interact with governments. We drill down a bit further into NIC's focus areas on slide eight, and importantly, how NIC's solutions map to our existing portfolio. As we assessed NIC's fit with Tyler, we thought about their portfolio of offerings through a number of lenses. Certain of NIC's end markets such as their solutions for businesses, courts and healthcare are highly complementary with Tyler's. NIC's presence in these sectors at the state and federal level are naturally aligned with Tyler's established presence at the local level. Other areas such as outdoor recreation and taxes represent natural adjacencies to expand Tyler's current business, while a sector like motor vehicles is a clear growth opportunity. The key takeaway from our assessment of NIC's portfolio is that there are a number of areas where Tyler's existing businesses will benefit from NIC quickly and were avenues of growth should open up organically for both of us over time. A similar fact pattern emerges, if you look at NIC's geographic footprint, which is shown on slide nine. NIC has established relationships across the nation including geographic alignment with Tyler in several complementary solution areas with 16 states where both companies have active contracts at different agencies. NIC's State Enterprise and Platform Solutions businesses, both of which we will touch on in greater detail in a moment, already have great breadth and depth, and we see a number of white space opportunities to expand these platforms as part of the Tyler portfolio. We also view NIC's federal client relationships as a natural fit to meaningfully expand our existing Tyler Federal business. On slide 10 we provide a more detailed overview of NIC's State Enterprise business, including a look at the long-term relationships the company has built over time. NIC's State Enterprise Solution offers a unique approach to working with governments by putting dedicated local teams in capital cities for support and developing services and solutions that are relevant to all agencies within a state government. NIC is able to deploy best practices gleaned over a number of decades and leverage a deep foundation of technological capabilities in tailoring solutions to fit specialized needs. The company's flexible state-wide contract vehicles allow governments to avoid cumbersome procurement processes by authorizing NIC to develop and implement a wide range of solutions across a number of different agencies. These long-term contracts lead to clear line of sight both operationally and from a revenue perspective, as evidenced by NIC's historic ability to grow same state revenue at 8% plus. NIC's Platform Solutions business, which is illustrated on slide 11 includes comprehensive agency-specific vertical solutions that are the product of significant investments NIC has made in recent years, both organically and inorganically and represent scalable solutions designed to address specific areas of market demand. On the payment side, NIC has built a comprehensive platform specifically designed for governments that can be integrated into state enterprise systems or offered standalone. Recently acquired solutions in licensing and healthcare are already showing early wins with new contracts awards across five states while NIC has successfully deployed various outdoor recreation solutions in 12 states. The early momentum in this piece of NIC's business is clearly evident and is very exciting for Tyler. We see significant opportunity to drive outsized growth with these platform technologies. Turning to slide 12, I would like to reiterate how strongly we believe in the merits of this transaction and view the addition of NIC as a combination of complementary strengths. With this acquisition we will create a public sector technology solutions leader that furthers our goal of connecting governments with constituents and businesses in a way that is seamless and transparent. I'd close by noting how delighted we are to soon welcome NIC and their employees to the Tyler family. I remind you that we expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of this year and is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approval by NIC stockholders. As a result, we are somewhat limited in our ability to discuss certain aspects of the transaction at this time. With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A. Yeah. Thanks, Kirk. On your first question around budgets and activity level, as we said going -- we said at the last quarterly call, our anticipation was that COVID would continue into 2021. As you recall, most of our clients, their budget seasons are June 30, so they are in the midst of those budgets. When you look back at 2020 and some of the comments I made during the year, the pandemic actually it was impacting different parts of our business a little bit differently. We saw a little more impact in our ERP space, particularly at the mid and higher end, and a little bit more in the appraisal and tax base. We actually had a really good sales year last year at courts and justice when they talk about that a little bit later was actually a record sales year for them. But the number of RFPs and demos and all that slowed down really impacted certain parts of our business more. And it's just anecdotal right now. We are now just one month into 2021, but in -- what we have seen a little bit, particularly on the ERP side, we don't talk about awards and wins, but the awards in January and the contract values was something that's certainly up over the last eight months and is a positive sign. We see things over and like in the appraisal and tax area where there are some fairly significant projects, some fairly large RFPs that really got put on the shelf in Q2 of last year. We are starting to see those starting to come out again, that doesn't necessarily mean mini contracts, as you know, or immediate deals, but we are seeing some of that. There is still going to be headwinds in 2021, obviously, with the COVID relief that just passed, there is some uncertainty about what that's going to mean. We are still seeing pushes and delays. But I think at your comment about defrosting, I kind of getting an early sense, but again it's anecdotal right now. I think we will know a lot more obviously at the end of Q1 and as the vaccine rolls out and people start getting more comfortable, I think, we will start getting better clear site on that. On the NIC front, I just want to say a couple of things, I have mentioned in the opening remarks, a couple of times now about stockholder approval and regulatory approval. There are certain things I can say right now and certain things I can't. I am going to air right now on the conservative side, because this is a big deal and I am so excited, and the last thing I want to do is overstep my bounds on this call with my excitement and do something to potentially jeopardize this transaction. I can tell you that we see a lot of revenue opportunities, lot of revenue opportunities for NIC and lot of revenue opportunities for Tyler. It's going to take some time just like all of our acquisitions. As you know you followed us a long time where we are a good acquirer, we bring companies in, we take our time. Our first model is make sure we don't break the great company that they have built. We are going to sit down with them and really map out sort of what those opportunities are and what's the best timeline to achieve them, while also keeping their strong business intact. I can just tell you that when we look at those and we look at how are the complementary nature of our businesses and the ability to utilize some of their state-wide contracts and what they are doing in payments and what we can learn from them and what they might can learn from us. It's pretty exciting. And I think, I really look forward to sharing a lot more detail as it goes on. But I am going to try to keep my comments at pretty high level at this point. Sure. Yeah. That's absolutely correct, Keith. And I think that's our history at Tyler is. We -- when we pursue an acquisition for strategic purposes and it's not to go in quote create synergies through cost, it's about how we are going to invest and grow that business and align it with ours. You have seen that throughout other Tyler acquisitions and it's one of the things I am most proud of. And in fact I mentioned in Kirk's response how C&J last year really had a record year in sales and a lot of that has to do with the fact of the acquisitions we have done over the years and how we have integrated them and opened up new markets and aligned them with our business and that's exactly what we see with the NIC acquisition. It's a great company, as you mentioned. It's the company built on integrity. They have got a great management team, really strong management team as you would expect and we are just really excited about bringing them into the Tyler fold and getting to work together. Yeah. I think, obviously, it's a little hard to nail down. As we said before on calls the demand didn't go away. I mean, everything we do is we provide a central functionality essential services, it's there. And what we have seen for example and what I have talked about in the past, I have mentioned that last year, maybe a little bit more difficult year on sales in our mid to upper level ERP space. That's really just a more reflection of people being able to hang on with their systems for another year and sort of sweat it out and it's my expectation that that pent-up demand will be released. It's hard to predict exactly when. And again, what we have talked about over the last year is, we really lean back on our experience back during the great recession. Well, it's not -- it's really not apples to apples, there is a lot of similarities and what we saw there was sort of a depressed market for a couple of years, but then that market open up. And it's sort of exploded and the fact that we were able to invest and improve our competitive position really put us in a great position to capitalize on that and that's the way we feel about it now. We are just as optimistic about the future as I was coming into 2020. Thanks. Yeah. Pete, and again, thanks for the comments on NIC. We couldn't agree more on the cultural fit and I want to spend a second on that before I get to your other questions is, we have done a lot of acquisitions over the years and the one thing that we have learned and one thing we primarily look for is cultural alignment. Because in our experience acquisitions can -- they can look great on paper and they can look great in banker books and all that stuff that you see. But really it doesn't matter if the cultures are aligned, it just doesn't matter how good it looks on paper, they just ultimately won't work out and that's one of the things that's so exciting about this. And as I have spent time with Harry, their CEO, and as we got to know their management team, just seeing their culture and seeing the way they approach the business and how it aligned with us and their vision. That's just a very key point. As it relates to the agreement itself, I believe the agreement got filed or will be filed today. So as you talk about no shop provisions and termination fees, those are all fairly standard negotiated provisions that you will see in these sorts of public company deals. I would say, the terms of those in this agreement are somewhat typical. I will let you go look those up in the side on those. But, yeah, they are fairly typical and things that you would expect to see in a stock transaction. On the financing front, I am glad you raised that. We have talked about forever our strong balance sheet and you are right. When you look at a net debt to EBITDA ratio, we believe it's going to be pretty manageable, maybe somewhere in the 3 times, the high 2s, low 3s, but somewhere around there will be pretty reasonable. The one thing I want to specifically emphasize as well, this is significant amount of debt and it's something that we haven't carried for a long time. It's my goal and my anticipation as we move to more committed financing that we are going to maintain a lot of flexibility and we are going to -- our balance sheet is still going to look very strong. It's one of the things I am committed to doing and putting this permanent financing together. I spoke to our Board about it two days ago. It's really important that how we structure this debt allows us to continue to do the things that we have done so successfully for so many years and have been a big part of our success. Things like the flexibility to continue and invest in all of our R&D initiatives that continue to do acquisitions as they arise and opportunistic share repurchases. It's my anticipation that we will still have that flexibility over the next several years as we work with the debt and I believe to be very manageable. So I appreciate that question. Yeah. So it's interesting, I'd actually -- throughout 2020 that was really more the case. There was probably a little more pressure on the state budgets than there was at the federal level and we saw that with our MicroPact and Socrata solutions. As we got into the fourth quarter and as actually state budgets have started to stabilize, we are actually starting to see the shift right now. And as we look into 2021, we see the state budgets actually starting to come back and opportunity starting to open up. And actually right now, at the federal level, it's a little bit more cautious, I wouldn't -- cautious maybe the wrong word, but it's really has more to do with the change in administration. And so there will probably be a little bit of a pause there on deals. We saw there were some deals in Q4 once the election happened and you get a change in administration, you get change in organization, leadership and priorities. There is just a little bit of a pause. But I would expect as the year continues to roll out and particularly with some of the initiatives that we are seeing come out at a Congress that's going to pick back up as the year goes on. I'd say, Scott, and I think, that was probably more their business model when they started. It's obviously there is still a part of that I think what they have been doing is they have been evolving their business to make it less custom and to make it more leverageable across their client base. You are also seeing what they have done the last several years where they have started to get some more vertical solutions. They have done a couple of small acquisition and starting to push those. I mean, I think, part of their overall growth plan absent Tyler, was to sort of continue to move in that direction and that's the direction they are moving on and we would expect that to continue. Yeah. Thanks, Scott. I think, it's going to be a mix of a little bit of both and part of it is, as we think about going through a cloud transformation -- really the cloud transformation at Tyler. And as you know, that's more than just getting your products into a certain state. It eventually really impacts the way not just how you develop products but how you deploy and support them. Part of that strategy, as you mentioned is, migrating our customers out of the Tyler systems and moving them over to AWS. The principal foundational piece of that though is, is making sure that our products as we move them over there that they operate in at least an efficient if not more efficient way than they are in the current Tyler cloud centers and that's what we are operating on now. I think you will see over and we talk about over the next three years, that doesn't mean all of them are all going to suddenly be magically there at December 31, 2023. It will be getting there in different stages along the way, some sooner than others. And I think as we go forward and we think about those plans, you will start to see us develop plans where perhaps new customers are all going into the AWS world. You will see certain areas where our products already are more cloud efficient or closer that we will become more aggressive with our existing customers and so it's going to be a little bit of blend and a mix. And that's also part of why we created this group. I mean, this group was created for a number of reasons. It's very exciting. Jeff, as you mentioned he's been here almost 30 years, he knows our business inside now. He is the perfect guy to oversee and coordinate and that's really part of what this role is. It's a Tyler-wide, company-wide coordination of all of these multiple streams that you are talking about. It's not just getting our products there. It's getting our plans on migration. It's getting plans on getting out to Tyler datacenters. It's improving our IT infrastructure and making information security standard discipline. It's all the things it starting to build. How we are going to deploy and support and all of that and so it's a comprehensive effort. And you will -- we will continue to talk more about it each quarter, each -- every three months, six months, and we will talk about the progress and as these plans evolve and they get a little more specific. But at a high level that's where it is. And Brian, we have talked before on the margins as we move people into the cloud world. We expect significant margin improvement and significant revenue improvement both getting them on the subscription. But then also getting our products more cloud efficient will help margins getting to where we have fewer releases and they are deployed easier, it will help margins. Everything that's all about the cloud transformation and that's all going to help over the coming years. Yeah. Charlie, I'd say two things. You are right. They definitely get a boost in 2020 on some specific COVID pandemic-related products and some initiatives around there. What I'd say to that is, that really shows their innovation and ingenuity and it shows their ability to spin up something quickly to meet the needs and to roll it out really quickly. And in my -- the way I view it is, while that was -- it's something that was really tied to the pandemic, that's something that is exciting to see that they can execute on that and to think that we can do things like that in other areas, particularly as we combine with some of the Tyler products. As you look at their overall revenue growth moving forward. I would say, my expectation is it would be more in line with Tyler's and when you look over the last couple of years. You -- if you look at it sort of in isolation on our 10-K or something, it may look like their overall revenue growth may have been lower. Part of that was the fact that there was a significant contract that they inherited, it wasn't when they originally sold with the State of Texas and when they lost that that was a significant headwind to year-over-year revenue growth. They have got a number of initiatives inside their business that will be growing at accelerated rates, just like we do at Tyler, some of these specific solution initiatives. I think you are going to see significant growth in their payments business. They -- as I mentioned on my opening remarks, they have recently won the contract with the State of Florida to not only provide state-wide payments across the State, but also it provides opportunities under that contract to do payments at the local level. So that's kind of at a high level the way I see it right now. Yeah. Thanks, Matt. On your first comment, you are right. Obviously, we -- the State of Texas contract was an extension of our previous relationship. We have done a lot of things there with the state to build in a lot of value to help our ability to recapture that contract and there is other upsides that come with that contract. One of the things that I have talked about over the last couple of quarters and it certainly haven't heard, yeah, Socrata plays a role. It's another value add that we do. But we all sort of seeing Socrata play a role in areas all across our company. And when we purchased Socrata, I guess, that was back in 2018, one of the things that we really liked about it is, not only do we believe that the future public sector is it will be have a focus around data and insights, but how it can really differentiate our products going forward. And I have talked about in public safety deals, we are starting to talk about it in our ERP deals. It's making a big difference. It's hard to quantify. But when we have that kind of functionality and that kind of insights and our competitors don't, it's just -- it's a huge add and it's something that's a big differentiator. As it relates to quote integration of NIC, again, we are still vary in the early stages of that and we still have a lot of conversations to have with their management team. This deal, while it's been sort of going on in the back works for, I think, I first reached out to Harry back in September and -- but things have been accelerating and we have talked a lot about the opportunities. But we have got a lot of work to do to get our teams, their teams together and start thinking about those things. Some of those are still going to be a little bit limited again because of regulatory restraints. But all I can tell you and continue to emphasize is, how excited I am, how excited our team is and I believe how excited their team is for the opportunities that we have that we can go out there and do together when we combine these two leadership roles. So, I would say that, there is a little bit of that. I think what we always want to differentiate even with this transaction base, just like I talked about in our core applications we differentiate with data and insights is the ability not just to do quote payment processing, but to be able to link those services with other offerings and things we do another and value adds. So that we really become more intertwined and tied with these government agencies. I mean, when -- you are right, when I look out to the future and I look to the future of the public sector market. I see the things like cloud and the provision of subscription-based essential functionality. It's digital services. It's transaction-based revenues. It's data and insights. It's our Connected Communities vision and it's bringing all of that stuff together in a way that really nobody else can. And so, yeah, to your question, there is a little bit of that, but we want to make sure that we get in there and add all these extra values and services to our clients that nobody else can deliver. It's a good question, Jonathan. And it's funny, as you know, I have been with Tyler since 1998, EGOV or NIC went public a year later. Obviously, they have been in business for several years before that and literally, they have been on our radar since the day when they went public. We have had internal conversations about them over the years. I would say that part of it is we have been so focused on our mission of getting really all the essential functional areas across local government. As I have said before, we talked about this, we did the MicroPact acquisition even Socrata, its areas that we have always been interested in, but we just haven't gotten there. I can't tell you why I didn't specifically pick up the phone and call Harry three years ago as opposed to this fall. But I can tell you that we spent a lot of time and a lot of work on it even before I made that call. And again we have had conversations for a long time and their business has grown and matured, our business has grown and matured and as we have grown and gotten more solutions and more opportunities and as they have grown and increased their footprint, we really see the balance. And when you look at things like the prior question on payments, this is a big strategic driver for us and it's a big strategic driver for them and they have got a very significant payments business, we have got an emerging payments business and we see the opportunities there. So it's just one of those things. But all I can say is we are very excited that we have made this deal that we have made today now. As you talk about our M&A strategy going forward, I would be surprised if this is the only acquisition we do this year. But this is also a big acquisition. It's going to require a lot of focus on our management teams and this is something we need to get right. And so I could see at some point particularly after this deal closes as we go into the second half of the year that sort of like we were back in 2019 where we may take a little bit of deliberate pause. But as I mentioned, we are going to have the financial wherewithal to continue to capitalize on acquisition opportunities and we are going to continue to look like we always have and I continue -- I expect that will continue to be part of our roadmap going forward, as we continue to see strategic products are ways to increase our TAM or expand our offerings in areas where we already have a large footprint. So our overall strategy won't change at all. Again, it will probably as we get to the second of the year, a little bit more like 2019. Yeah. So, I'd say, first of all, just initially it goes back to all of our investments and continue to invest in those. And what we have seen in the market is that some of our competitors are not making the investments that they may have historically done and we have seen a little bit of that. But when we see things like in our Incode Group, which is really the lower end of ERP it's where our schools is, it's where utility billing and things like that. That group right now are seeing record win rates. I mean, their win rates are approaching 90%, which is just off the chart and so we get really excited about when we think about the market returning. When we see things like I mentioned earlier on the call, our Courts & Justice Group. 2020 was actually the highest sales year for our Courts & Justice Division. Now, they are POC accounting, so it's not all going to flow in right away. But you remember back in 2014, 2015 when that group had really high sales which is when California opened up. That's a process of, I mean, not only our Odyssey continues to be strong, but all the investments we have made around there and the expanded products including acquisitions which was your question earlier and being able to sell all those products and have more functionality and be more competitive. We talk about the public safety. Public safety had another 1 million plus license deal this quarter. They are just on a roll. They had a very big win in Genesee County, Michigan against Motorola and CentralSquare. And again, that's a result of our competitiveness, our ability to check more boxes on the RFPs, our ability to go up market. And again all these acquisitions that are differentiating these offerings, so those are few examples and we just like where we sit right now and we anxiously await for pre-pandemic market. Thanks, Jon. Yeah. I think part of that conversion is also just the general market and as we said for a couple of years, the market was moving in this direction, certainly, COVID, I think is accelerating that. We are doing some things internally. It is a focus point for us. I think, one of our greatest opportunities is our existing customer base, whether it's new products that go in there, whether it's converting them to the SaaS model, continue to push in, inside sales continue to be one of our big growth drivers and so it's a combination of a lot of things. But you are right, it's a focus of ours and as we continue to get our products into a more cloud efficient state, it will become even more of a focus and even more pronounced. And it's going to take some time, I mean, I don't want to say this is all going to happen in the next few quarters, but it's going to take some time, but it's definitely the direction we are moving and it's a significant opportunity. Thank you. Thanks. Thanks everybody for joining us today. We hope you continue to stay safe and healthy, and if you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to me or Brian Miller. Thanks again."

Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. We were pleased with our third quarter results as we continue to execute at a high level, particularly in light of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. After we experienced our first year-over-year decline in quarterly revenues in almost a decade, we returned to revenue growth this quarter, driven by strength in recurring revenues. We have not experienced any meaningful cancellations, but longer sales cycles and delays in projects as clients deal with the effects of the pandemic, along with the near elimination of billable travel, led to declines in software license, professional services and appraisal service revenues. However, GAAP subscription revenues grew a robust 18.6% and non-GAAP subscription revenues grew 18%. We continued to experience significant savings in operating expenses in the third quarter, in part driven by the successful deployment of more efficient service delivery and operating models. As a result, our operating margins expanded significantly with our non-GAAP operating margin up 300 basis points to 28.6%. And our adjusted EBITDA was a new quarterly record at $89 million. Cash flow has also been very robust throughout the year, and both cash from operations and free cash flow reached new quarterly highs in the third quarter. It was also a strong quarter for bookings, which rose almost 13%. While the number of new deals was down, the average deal size and total new contract value both were up compared to last year. It was a strong quarter for new business for our Justice solutions as we closed some large contracts after extended sales processes. Our largest deal in the quarter was a license arrangement with the Washington State Courts of Limited Jurisdiction, valued at approximately $15 million for our Odyssey Court Case Management and Caseload Pro Probation Solutions, including e-filing. We also signed significant Justice solutions contract with Dallas County, Texas, including a license arrangement for our Odyssey Solution for criminal and justice of the peace courts valued at approximately $8 million and a SaaS arrangement for our Jury Management Solution valued at approximately $1.6 million. Also, for our Odyssey solution, we signed a license arrangement with Saginaw County, Michigan, and notable SaaS deals with the city of Akron, Ohio and the Texas counties of Guadalupe, Leon, Gillespie and Erath (4:31). We also signed the first state-level contract for our Tyler Supervision product, formerly known as Caseload Pro, with the state of Nevada. Our Public Safety division continues to expand its market with the year-to-date average deal size up 92% over last year. This expansion reflects our increasing competitiveness upmarket as well as an increase in the breadth of products in many deals. Our Public Safety division had never signed two contracts with licenses greater than $1 million each in the same quarter until this quarter, when we signed large contracts with Sedgwick County, Kansas and the City of Laredo, Texas. We also signed a multi-suite contract with Ellis County, Kansas for our New World Public Safety, Odyssey Courts, Socrata Data & Insights and Brazos Solutions and contracts with the city of Brownsville, Texas and Des Moines, Iowa for our Public Safety and Socrata Data & Insight Solutions. Our largest SaaS deal in the quarter was a $6 million contract with the city of Tigard, Oregon in the port \u2013 excuse me \u2013 in the Portland metropolitan area for our Munis ERP and EnerGov Civic Services solutions. We also signed notable SaaS deals for our Munis ERP solution with the city of Fairfield, California; Champaign County, Illinois; the Virginia Railway Express; the city of Thomasville, Georgia, and a license arrangement with the city of Christiansburg, Virginia. Other significant SaaS deals for our EnerGov Civic Services solution were the cities of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida and Yonkers, New York. Finally, it was also a strong quarter for new business in our federal space with several new contracts, most notably with the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, The Counter Trade Products and the Fish and Wildlife Service, both departments within the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services. As we reported in a Form 8-K filed on September 29, we discovered early on September 23 that an unauthorized third-party intruder had disrupted access to some of our internal phone and IT systems. As soon as we discovered this, we shut down points of access to external systems out of an abundance of caution. We immediately activated our internal incident response plan, which included taking impacted systems offline to further contain the spread. We confirmed that the malicious software the intruder use was ransomware. We are following strict protocols laid out by industry standard incident response directives. Because of this, we are being careful not to share certain details around the incident until the investigation is finished. However, there is some information I can share with you today. From the morning of September 23, our incident response efforts have been facilitated by Tyler's internal resources as well as third-party providers. Those third-party providers include FireEye Mandiant, a nationally recognized incident response provider. We also have been actively cooperating with law enforcement. Our initial analysis has continued to prove correct. The impact of the incident was directed at our internal corporate network and phone systems. There has been no evidence of compromise in the separate and segregated environments where we host software for our clients. And to date, there has been no evidence of malicious activity on client self-hosted systems related to this incident. From day one, we have been regularly communicating with our client community and have actively maintained an incident response page on our website. We encourage you to check for updates there as well. In addition to the containment, recovery and remediation efforts we have undertaken, Tyler has also taken steps to supplement the existing multilayered security monitoring, scanning and antivirus protocols already in place. We are committed to completing our full forensics investigation and taking all appropriate actions in response to our findings. The security incident did impact our ability to deliver licenses and services during late September and into October. We currently estimate the impact to revenue was approximately $1.5 million in the third quarter and $2.5 million in the fourth quarter. We maintained cybersecurity insurance coverage in amount that we believe is adequate. I want to reiterate that what I have just shared with you represents the information we can share at this point, given where we're at in the stage of our investigation and the recovery process. We will not be addressing the incident further on today's call, and we will not take questions on the incident itself or our investigation. I would, however, like to express my gratitude to all Tyler employees, who once again displayed the heart of Tyler in their response and handling of the security incident, especially our internal IT teams that worked around the clock with an aggressive and coordinated response to recover and remediate our internal systems. As with our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tyler demonstrated the resiliency that comes from strong and well-designed business processes and corporate governance practices. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter.\nBrian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. Although our revenues continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we were pleased to return to positive revenue growth this quarter. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $285.7 million, up 3.8%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $285.9 million, up 3.2%. Organic revenue growth was 3.3% on a GAAP basis and 2.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Our core software license and subscription revenues grew \u2013 combined grew \u2013 8.1% on a non-GAAP basis with 7.8% organic growth. Subscription revenues for the quarter increased 18.6%. We added 114 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a quarterly high of 46 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $56 million in total contract value. In Q3 of last year, we added 150 new subscription-based arrangements and had 20 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $47 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 47% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 51% in Q3 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 4.3 years compared to 2.7 years in Q3 of last year. Revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, were $23.2 million, up 9%. That amount includes e-filing revenues of $15.1 million, up 2.5% over last year and e-payments revenues of $8.1 million, up 23.6%. Transaction-based revenues were negatively impacted by reduced operations at some clients as a result of the pandemic. For the third quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $830 million, up 11%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q3 was approximately $265 million, up 21.6%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $93 million, up 9%, and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $472 million, up 6.2%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.55 billion, up 9.2%. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were strong at $292 million, up 12.9%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.3 billion, up 5.4% against a tough comparison that includes the two large North Carolina courts deals totaling approximately $105 million in the prior trailing 12 months. Our software subscription bookings in the third quarter added $9.9 million in new annual recurring revenue. Cash flow from operations increased 30.5% to $169. 8 million and free cash flow grew 34.8% to $165.4 million, both new quarterly highs. In fact, year-to-date, our free cash flow has already surpassed our best full year free cash flow by more than 9%. We ended the quarter with approximately $650 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Our guidance for the full year of 2020 is as follows. We expect 2020 GAAP revenues will be between $1.117 billion and $1.129 billion, and non-GAAP revenues will be between $1.118 billion and $1.130 billion. We expect 2020 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.53 and $4.63 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2020 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.48 and $5.58. For the year, estimated pre-tax non-cash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $77 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be between $88 million and $90 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 41.5 million and 42 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of negative 12% after discrete tax items, and includes approximately $65 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. Our estimated non-GAAP effective \u2013 annual effective tax rate for 2020 is 24%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be between $30 million and $31 million for the year, including approximately $10 million related to real estate and approximately $6 million of capitalized software development costs. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $81 million, including approximately $54 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Lynn for some additional comments.\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. With the challenges our clients face as a result of the spread of COVID-19, our clients' need for digital connectedness, both within their organizations and directly with the public is rapidly shifting from a vision to an urgent requirement. We're gratified by the accolades Tyler is receiving for our innovations to help our clients address the challenges of the current environment. During the third quarter, our Virtual Court solution, which has been selected by approximately 60 courts nationwide, received the AWS Best Remote Work Solution award in conjunction with its use in the city of Alvin, Texas. We also won the Coolest Overall Technology Innovation Award from School Technology (sic) [Transportation] (17:21) News for our new bus attendance application, which works with Tyler's bus routing solutions to provide schools a tool for limiting bus capacity, contact tracing and social distancing on the school bus. On the product development front, we are continuing all of our strategic initiatives, including product R&D projects, and accelerating our move to the cloud and still expect that R&D expense will grow at more than 9% for the year. While some of our competitors are laying off staff, we continue to add new employees to support long-term growth opportunities, and we added 27 net new heads during the third quarter, mostly in product development. We also continue to adapt our operations, providing client support and delivering professional services such as training remotely and executing complex go-lives virtually, improving utilization and eliminating most travel costs. Many administrative and sales and marketing activities, including sales demos, trade shows and user group meetings are also being conducted virtually with reductions in associated expenses. We continue to explore the possibility of greater numbers of employees working remotely, even after our offices fully reopen. Lower expenses have more than offset revenue reductions relative to our pre-COVID plan, resulting in margin expansion. Some of these expense reductions, such as sales commissions and health claims are short-term in nature, but we do expect that some savings will be sustainable. As a result, we expect to continue to see year-over-year margin expansion in the fourth quarter. We expect that revenue growth for the fourth quarter will continue to be significantly impacted by the pandemic, and to a much lesser extent, the IT security incident. Although our variable revenue streams will continue to be affected by the current environment, we anticipate that recurring revenues, which comprise more than 70% of our total revenues, will continue to be relatively unaffected. While we remain confident in our long-term outlook, there are uncertainties around the continuously evolving COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations and those of our clients. For example, government response to the pandemic continued to vary significantly from state-to-state and even from jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction within a state, thereby making the duration and scope of business restrictions within the public sector difficult to predict. Many public sector entities are facing near-term budget pressures that could cause them to delay spending in the coming year. The COVID-19 pandemic has not changed our view of the underlying fundamentals and long-term demand for our software. If anything, the current crisis is highlighting the unsustainable reliance on outdated technology by much of the public sector. Technology is an increasingly critical factor in helping government function effectively, especially in difficult times. While it is too soon to fully assess the impact of the elections, we expect that additional federal stimulus will be forthcoming to provide further economic aid to state and local governments. We are confident that new long-term opportunities will emerge from this crisis, as both Tyler and our clients reexamine historical business practices. And that Tyler is better positioned than our competitors to provide innovative solutions to help our clients meet new challenges. Our balance sheet is stronger than ever, with $650 million in cash and investments and no debt. We plan to continue to invest at a high level in R&D and actively pursue M&A opportunities to broaden our total addressable market and build on our strong competitive position. I continue to be extremely proud and inspired by how the entire Tyler team has risen to face the challenges of this year head on, supporting our clients as well as each other. We are confident in the fundamental strengths of the public sector market and our ability to grow and invest in strategic initiatives in a difficult environment, and we look forward to executing our long-term strategies until conditions allow us to return to a higher growth market. Now, we'll take questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And your first question today will come from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter J. Heckmann - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the questions. As regards additional federal government stimulus, there were some \u2013 there was a bill floated earlier in the year \u2013 just focused on technology modernization. Can you talk about the different types of programs that might be pending and where you expect both broad stimulus funds to help municipal budgets, but as well, any directed programs that you're watching that you think could be relatively near term.\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Pete. And you're right. I think generally speaking, there's an expectation that there's going to be another round of stimulus. I think both political parties agree on that. I think for certain that the last month or so, maybe two months, it's become a little bit more of a politicized issue that I think will get behind us, now that the election is behind us. In fact, I read an article this morning where Mitch McConnell in the Senate said that getting a stimulus passed by the end of the year was his new top priority as well as \u2013 and he made a comment specifically \u2013 as well as state and local government stimulus. So, I think that's coming. I think that's the expectation. It's hard to know exactly where everything's going to shake out, but I do think it will become a priority following this election, once things settle out a little bit more. I think I talked about last time \u2013 at the last call \u2013 the prior Fed Chairman Bernanke, he made a comment coming out of the Great Recession, that one of the things that they, I think, sort of missed the boat on was they did not devote enough money to state and local governments when they were doing their stimulus then. I think that's a significant priority. We've also talked about the Fed has specific bond buying programs for counties and cities, and I think that's going to continue. So, the expectation is there. I think the expectations for our clients, I think there's \u2013 that's part of the hesitancy going on right now \u2013 but I see that coming on the horizon.\nBrian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: And I'd add one other thing. I think what you were alluding to there is, there does seem to be bipartisan efforts to provide more funding, specifically for state and local government IT upgrades. There was an act \u2013 The State and Local IT Modernization and Cybersecurity Act that was proposed back in August \u2013 and that act would provide $28 billion over the next five years, specifically to upgrade government IT systems. So, the upgrading of systems is certainly something that the federal government recognizes is important.\nPeter J. Heckmann - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then just in terms of where budgets are right now, typically, the fourth quarter is strong for public safety. Public safety seems to have a fair amount of momentum and encouraging to hear bigger solution sets and bigger deal sizes in public safety, but do you think based on where we are we, you're on track with public safety bookings for the fourth quarter or are you \u2013 I guess what's your level of comfort that you'll hit your targets there on the public safety side.\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, Pete, I think that's a good question. And the short answer is yes. And what we've seen, generally is, we've seen a little bit of difference in terms of bit of difference in terms of different market segments but public safety the demand's still there. We expect some significant deals to still come through in the fourth quarter. I think one of the things that's encouraging about public safety is as we continue to invest and we've added more portfolio of products to their bag, is that, historically, the fourth quarter was \u2013 was one that was, I think, a little more skewed towards their license deals and it still is. But as that business grows and as it gains traction, we're starting to sort of level that out a bit. We've had, as we noted, we had for the first time ever two license deals over $1 million in Q3, which is pretty incredible. In fact, now I think it's now three of the last four quarters, we've had license deals in excess of $1.5 million. So the momentum's there in public safety. It's funny, I think 10 days from now will be our five year anniversary of acquiring that, and I think it's a testament to the work that those people have put in and the investments we've put in. And we talk about how it takes a little bit of time with some of these investments, these acquisitions, and they're really starting to hit their stride; they're doing a great job.\nPeter J. Heckmann - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Good, good to hear. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt VanVliet of BTIG. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew David VanVliet - BTIG LLC: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I really appreciate it. I guess, on the front of the services disruption from the ransomware attack. Maybe not a question directly from that, but as how it impacted you during the quarter? You talked about inability or, I guess, a disruption in delivering some of your projects. Was that a reallocation of resources or were you forced to kind of dig a little deeper with some of those customers and assess sort of what happened and sort of give them some additional information to make sure that they were comfortable moving forward? And then on the same front, sort of how that might have impacted overall pipeline processes going on?\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes. So \u2013 and you \u2013 I don't want to go into too much more detail. But the short answer is, as we talked about, the incident was really all about our internal systems. It was about our phone systems, our website and things of that nature. However, out of abundance of caution, what we, as I mentioned in my comments, what we did was we immediately shut down all external points of entry. So, that disrupted things like being able to conduct \u2013 we do a lot of services \u2013 support was disrupted. We weren't able to send e-mails with attachments for a while. And really that, again, that was just out of abundance of caution. So, it was really short term. To your second question, as it relates to pipeline, it has not had any impact really on our pipeline. There was obviously a little short-term disruption, but we haven't seen anything meaningful in terms of future impact of sales or anything like that.\nMatthew David VanVliet - BTIG LLC: And then, looking at your overall sort of K-through-12 school customer base and potential customers out there, how much of a disruption to their overall typical operational processes \u2013 the limited, maybe in-person schooling or definite hybrid situations out there \u2013 are either changing that narrative or accelerating some of those deals that they now feel like they need to have more technology in place, more ability to work remotely and have more digital services in place.\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, so I would say two things. As it relates to schools, in particular, I'd say that's one area right now where budget impacts is sort of constraining some deals from moving forward; it's pushing some things out. At the same time, you're right. It's absolutely highlighting \u2013 and this goes beyond schools \u2013 it's highlighting the need for technology. I think when I look at the business overall of the public sector, I think the shift that we're starting to see, that part of it's due to COVID, but it's new, more online, mobile, public access \u2013 things that are interaction with the parents, with the schools \u2013 but even more just citizens engaging with their communities. That's something that's going to continue. And I think that was the future anyway, but I think COVID has really sort of accelerated that. So, and I think what's encouraging about that to me, Matt, is that Tyler really is out in the forefront of this. We're the best positioned for this. This brings in our whole Connected Communities vision and things that we're already doing. And so it really puts us in a great position when things \u2013 when we sort of get on the other side of this.\nMatthew David VanVliet - BTIG LLC: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Charlie Strauzer of CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nCharles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: Hi, good morning. Can you talk a little bit maybe just give kind of a quick early view of next year? I know usually you give more detailed guidance on the next call, but just given that you saw a return to growth in Q3, maybe just some early thoughts on next year.\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes. Sure, Charlie. And I guess I'd start off by saying \u2013 and we talked about on the last call \u2013 is we don't see any real meaningful change in our pipeline. We know the demand for our services don't go away. We remember how we started the year in the first quarter before it hit. We were out to a really great start and so we sort of expect that to continue. At the same time, we also talked about we're in the middle of these June 30, July 1 budget cycles right now. So my expectation is that there will be some hangover. still be some delays in some deals, still some clients that are reluctant to open up and do some remote delivery of services. We're still waiting to see courts opening back up, so some of our transaction volumes kick up. I'd say stepping back on a high side, just sort of generally, you're right. We are in the budget process right now. It is a little bit early. I'd say on the revenue side, I would expect revenue growth to be higher than what it's been in 2020, but probably not a full return to sort of our pre-COVID expectations of high single digits, 9%, 10%, 11% growth. But I do expect it to be better than this year. But that's kind of where we are on the revenue side.\nCharles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: That's very helpful. Thanks, Lynn. And secondly, just you're generating a ton of cash, really just want to just get a better sense of now that you've got so much cash on the balance sheet, any change in priorities for the use of cash? Is M&A something that's more of a priority and are you seeing any pipeline activity in the M&A front?\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes. Sure, Charlie. And yes, we're always \u2013 we've talked before \u2013 we're always looking at deals and that's continued. That has not slowed down during COVID. In fact, one of the things that we've done over the last six months, you probably remember us talking about over the last couple of years is our white space initiative. We've actually taken the time, dived a little deeper, refined that, and really making that forefront. We're going to continue to be opportunistic on those deals. But we're out there, we're looking. I would like to see us do some deals, and so we're out there looking.\nCharles Strauzer - CJS Securities, Inc.: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you, guys, for taking my question. Good morning. Lynn, one for you and then I had a follow-up for Brian. Lynn, so I think it was around this time year that you guys started to see that cross-sell traction in New World Public Safety into some of your existing Tyler accounts. I think it started on your home turf in Texas. And I'm curious, you mentioned that the federation approach starting to take hold. Curious this quarter with that strength that you saw in public safety, it's getting a bit more linear and less back-end loaded, are you seeing that trend continue where you're seeing pull-through from Tyler customers that are also committing on the public safety side as well and how that's progressing?\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: We are. We've gotten, as you mentioned, we \u2013 I think some of the initial traction was in Texas. We're seeing some good things on the West Coast in California. I think what's particularly encouraging is this continued move-up market, which is also part of the fact that we're \u2013 the Tyler Alliance story \u2013 the total Tyler story is really starting to resonate. The largest deal they did this quarter was Sedgwick County, Kansas, that was about a $1.6 million license deal. And that was a full suite of CAD, enterprise records, but also pulling through things \u2013 SoftCode, our field reporting, Tyler Corrections, Brazos, Socrata, Mobility \u2013 all these things. And that's part of that strategy as well. And I think the key selling point there was really the whole Tyler Alliance story. And that's what \u2013 that's the feedback we've gotten from the field and the client. And that's what's also encouraging because as we know, there's \u2013 there isn't anybody else out there that can compete on that level. And in fact, the competitor we had in that was Motorola. So it's particularly gratifying to see these strategies start to play out and start to win these bigger deals, which include going upmarket as you \u2013 but also as you say \u2013 leveraging other Tyler relationships, other Tyler products to get these deals.\nRob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thanks, Lynn, appreciate that. And then, Brian, just for you, you guys are executing really well on the margin front with the strong margin growth year-over-year. And just curious, I know some of those benefits likely come from COVID, but if we could just get some color on how that breakdown might be to think about what was a COVID benefit and what might be something that's more sustainable in terms of margin benefit? Thanks, guys.\nBrian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes. And as we work through our planning for next year, we'll have a better idea of how those \u2013 how much of it is actually sustainable. Coming into the year, pre-COVID, we had had a goal kind of holding margins flat with last year after a couple of down years as a result of our significant increases in R&D. We've continued to spend R&D pretty close to what we expected for the year, but we're now up \u2013 this quarter \u2013 up 300 basis points. I don't expect that the margin growth will be as high in Q4 or that we'll see 300 basis points next year. But we do expect that we'll be back on a margin expansion opportunity in that a significant part of the gains, although they've come about because of COVID, we've been able to change business practices, particularly remote delivery of services, changing the way we approach some things like trade shows, eliminating a lot of administrative travel that I think will be permanent gains. So, if you look at the 300 basis points we picked up this quarter, maybe as much as half of that would be a sustainable kind of a gain.\nRob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thanks again.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nJonathan Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to just start out with maybe getting a little bit more clarity around sort of the reduction in the full year revenue guidance. Was this mainly due to, I guess, the issue faced, just wanted to get maybe just the main factors behind that.\nBrian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Sure. Yes, if you look at the change in our full year revenue guidance, I believe the midpoint of our guidance came down by about $11 million compared to where that was when we reinitiated guidance after Q2. About $4 million of that is what we talked about earlier on the call related to the IT security incident where we lost primarily services revenues, some license revenues, as a result of a lack of ability to interface with clients while our systems were compromised. There's about $1 million related to lower e-filing volumes, as courts have not reopened as fast as we anticipated at the end of Q2. A lot of e-filing volume is around evictions and debt collections. And as you know, there's \u2013 the CDC has now put in place a broader moratorium on evictions and so those volumes are lower than we expected. And then there's about roughly $8 million of an effect on licenses, which are primarily sales delays, processes being pushed out, and that's a combination really of COVID and its impact on our clients' ability to work remotely, and budget pressures (39:18) as well. So those are \u2013 and then lastly \u2013 licenses are also being affected by a greater shift towards SaaS in our pipeline than even we anticipated at the end of the second quarter, for the reasons we talked about, Lynn talked about earlier on the call.\nJonathan Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And just to build on that, with budget pressure on state and local governments, are you starting to see, I guess, a greater desirability towards moving to cloud and SaaS solutions and particularly, for the cost savings side, is that starting to accelerate? Thanks.\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes, Jonathan, I think that's a good observation. And I think going in \u2013 pre-COVID \u2013 we were already starting to see this shift in the market and I think that was going to continue on its own anyway. I think, secondly, as we've talked about over the last year plus or two years, as Tyler has shifted its approach from more of a cloud agnostic to more cloud preferred or cloud first, we're doing things with how we do our sales and how we inform clients. And so, I think that's been part of it. But absolutely, COVID has played a role there. And we're seeing that really across all of our divisions. I mean we're seeing it \u2013 our Munis ERP \u2013 they're all coming in right now at rates, subscription rates that were higher than their original 2020 plan. And so that's definitely occurring, and again, the good news is that we've been preparing for it and ready for it and we've been investing towards there. So it's a short-term headwind, continues to be, but that trend is going to continue, I believe.\nJonathan Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.\nKeith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. To come back to the transaction costs and some of the delays you're seeing in evictions and recovery of debt, does this perhaps create a pent-up demand as we look into next year, assuming that some of these restrictions let up and the courts kind of open up. Are we perhaps looking to have an opportunity for significant revenue growth from that area next year?\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes, Keith, that's a good observation. I think that's right. That's certainly our expectation. I mean, even though courts have been starting to reopen some, as Brian mentioned, there has been this moratorium. And really about almost two-thirds of court filings are either debt-related or landlord-tenant eviction type things. So, our expectation is that, that will go up. Even when you look at sort of on the more municipal side or traffic side, you don't have a lot of citations out there. You don't have a lot of people paying court fines and things like that on the \u2013 more on the municipal side \u2013 but we would expect that those will return to normal. But in terms of the backlog on the civil side, yes, I think that's our current expectation.\nKeith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Great. And Brian, just a follow-up for you. Gross margins came in probably the best that I remember them being. Maybe it's more just a geography question more than anything else, but is that more due to lower travel costs? Or was there other items going on in gross margins that perhaps are sustainable going forward?\nBrian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Well, a big piece of that, both at the gross and operating margin is the absence of billable travel, which has essentially no margin on it. And so that continues to \u2013 that loss of that revenue continues to be \u2013 have a positive impact. That's probably the biggest point. The other thing is we are seeing, as we move to the remote delivery of services, we actually gain utilization and efficiency there because we're not putting people on airplanes every Monday and every Friday, and we're able to use that time to deliver services. And so, that shift is having a positive impact as well. And that is something that we expect to be sustainable. Although certainly in the future, there will be some billable travel and some return to on-site services, we believe that in the long-term, we'll continue to deliver a significant amount of services remotely as our experience over the last two or three quarters is proving that that can be done very effectively and clients are increasingly accepting of that model.\nKeith Housum - Northcoast Research Partners LLC: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Hi, Lynn, Hi, Brian. Congrats on a good quarter and thanks for taking my questions. I guess two questions. Let's start off with Lynn, on the public safety side. You talked about how \u2013 I think it's three of the last four quarters you had $1 million-plus transactions. Obviously, your sales traction has been very strong there, with how you've been able to add some new innovation of the product and pushed upmarket. But as you look at those deals today, versus maybe three or four years from now, is it simply just your ability to take the same product and move it upmarket or has that product evolved at all? And you've had maybe better success selling, maybe either more or different modules within that suite that's relatively broad at the end of the day.\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes, Scott, it's actually \u2013 it's quite a number of factors. And I want to be clear, is through last four quarters, we've had license deals in excess of $1.5 million, which is even better. And you're right, it's \u2013 we've done a lot over the last several years, both in terms of expanding our functionality. We're now responding to more RFPs, than we could before. We're more compliant than we were before. So, we've made the product much more robust. In addition, it's hard to underestimate, really what we've done on the service side as well, really shoring up client references. As we've introduced these new products, CAD and e-records, the number of go-lives that have been successful, in getting those references, that's the stuff we don't spend a lot of time talking about. But one of the biggest initiatives this year was our e-records which was going about (45:52) the same as the CAD. They had, I think, 15 big go-lives scheduled for this year and a number of those had pushed back a little bit just because of COVID, but we're on track to get all those done. We've had 11 of them successful. And that's the hard stuff and it's that referenceability. But then when you talk about, again, moving upmarket, it's all these tuck-in acquisitions and integrating them. It's these things like SceneDoc, SoftCode, Brazos, Socrata. And what you don't ever know is, in these big deals, you never know exactly what's the tipping point. But our \u2013 what we can deliver, the full suite of products \u2013 is so much more competitive and then it's so much more broader than what other people are offering that it just becomes very compelling.\nScott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Got it. Quite helpful and then from a follow-up perspective and one of your other questions here shortly, a few minutes ago, Lynn, you talked about how public safety transactions and what's usually a seasonally stronger fourth quarter looked like you're generally on track. With the earlier comments about pipelines kind of slipping and some deals moving into maybe the first half of 2021, what are the product areas that are seeing the most delays there, if it's not public safety?\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: So, I would say the area where we're seeing probably more delays is really on the higher end of the ERP space, more of our Munis line. It's interesting the lower end is not seeing the same right now. But then again, stepping back, it was that high-end ERP space that really got out of the gate fast in Q1 and that's what's still so encouraging. We've talked about how the demand didn't go away. What seems to be happening there, as opposed to say, in our Justice solutions or even the lower end space, is that some counties \u2013 there's that uncertainty out there \u2013 but they just seem to be a little bit more willing to push it out a little bit further, or I'd say, hang on another year. I'd almost analogize it to \u2013 you've got a car, an old car you've had since college \u2013 and you've got a couple of kids and a spouse and that car's starting to spend more time in the shop than on the road. And you know it's time to get that thing fixed, but golly, your kids who have braces coming up this year or something happening with one of your jobs. You say, I'm going to hang on one more year before I do it. And I think we're seeing that there more so than, say, on the other sides of the business.\nScott Berg - Needham & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the good quarter, again.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nKirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC: Yeah, thanks very much and congrats on a good quarter in a tough environment. Lynn, maybe I was curious about just sort of your philosophy these days on using pricing maybe more as a weapon, given that you're much bigger today than you were back in the economic recession 10 years ago. And just whether or not that resonates with clients or not, meaning, are there things you all can do from an upfront pricing perspective that can help you maybe take share in this period of uncertainty? And I guess, how do you balance that? Because I would think you're now at a point where, as customers are looking to consolidate vendors, if you can help them maybe get over the hump today and hopefully their budgeting problems resolve themselves in the next 12, 18 months, that can make some sense in terms of taking more market share. But just kind of \u2013 can you just give me an idea of how you're kind of thinking about that, if at all?\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, sure, Kirk. I think we're doing a little bit of that, and we're doing a little bit of that with some of these products that we're really planning to try to introduce this year or that we really were expecting to sort of jump start this year. And I'm not talking about our major core apps, but some of our smaller products around that, be it \u2013 we talked before about at Socrata Data & Insights or our product called Executive Insights. We're doing things there like offering one-year free Premier Executive Insight. We've talked about it with virtual courts. We've done these free trial periods. We're doing things like that around our Tyler Detect, which is our cybersecurity, our research, taxes, things like that. So, we are seeing some of that right now. In terms of \"gaining market share\", I think the things that we're doing right now by keeping our investments at the level and accelerating some of them being in that position to really capitalize, knowing that we went into this already in probably the strongest position in the market. And the way I view it, really, Kirk, is that as we're dealing with the effects of this pandemic \u2013 and we know it's going to end and we know the demand is going to be there \u2013 but every quarter that goes by, Tyler itself is getting stronger and stronger. Our balance sheet is getting stronger. We're investing. Every quarter goes by, we're another quarter down in our R&D and further along in our investments. We don't believe our competitors are doing the same. And so, I really like our position right now. And yeah, we're looking at things like that on some of these products we're trying to jump start, but we're not really doing that really across our core apps right now.\nKirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess for you or maybe Brian, just you've mentioned M&A a couple of times. Has the environment for doing deals gotten better perhaps over the last six months as smaller vendors are obviously probably feeling more pressure from either balance sheet or growth \u2013 revenue growth perspective. And obviously, valuations across software have been fairly robust over the last six months. So just kind of curious, I know you're always looking, but have the \u2013 I guess, has the bid-ask spread maybe started to narrow a little bit on things that you find attractive, maybe relative to six or nine months ago?\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: I'd say that in terms of the sort of number of deals we look at, it's probably kind of consistent with what we were before. I haven't seen any really increased activity there. I think my expectation, if you go back to the Q1 call, my expectation might have been \u2013 you might have seen more on the valuation front. I think some of them may have come down a little bit, but the broader market is still doing pretty well. I'm talking about the public markets and sometimes people tend to point to that when they shouldn't. But we haven't seen any meaningful expectations right now out of valuation, probably about the same as before.\nKirk Materne - Evercore Group LLC: Okay. Great. That's it for me. Thanks guys. Take care.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent A, Bracelin - Piper Sandler & Co. (Broker): Thanks, and good afternoon. I guess, Lynn, I wanted to go back to this concept of this digital wakening that we're clearly seeing across other enterprises, other segments of the market. On one hand, totally appreciate a greater level of uncertainty with state and local budgets. But on the other hand, you do have kind of a new reality and a new digital reality. What are you seeing just from a state, local engagement activity metric? You talked a little bit about seeing larger deals materialize because of maybe this digital shift, but is the engagement activity picking up as well, too? I get there will be budget uncertainty, but is the \u2013 is there anything you can see that gives you more confidence that that shift to digital could also accelerate in that government vertical?\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, I do believe the shift to how government's going to operate, how they're going to deliver services to their citizens, I believe that was going to change pre-COVID, and I think it's going to change and accelerate past that. And one of the things I talk about is, you look at your kids and you look at how they think about technology and how they use technology, well, they're going to grow up. They're the citizens of the future \u2013 they're citizens today, but they're the ones that are \u2013 they're going to demand more. They're going to demand that government works the way everything else in their lives work. Earlier this week, I was \u2013 I did an interview for the National League of Cities. We talked with Clarence Anthony, the CEO there, and this is for their upcoming user conference. We spent a lot of time talking about the cloud and the local government shift and move to the cloud. And to me, it's something that's coming. It was coming anyway. I think COVID is accelerating that. And you talk about budget constraints. I mean, that's one of the factors about that. You've got, as you move to the cloud, you do create some budget certainty. You take away sort of some of the uncertainties of these large capital spends. You talk about security in today's world. We spent a lot of time talking about cybersecurity. And the cloud is such a more secure environment and you're dealing with these players like AWS who we're aligned with, they've got all kinds of resources to spend on that infrastructure, and that's their business. And that's not really that's not really a local government's business. And so \u2013 and I think they're starting to recognize that. And so, I do think the shift is real and I do think it's accelerating.\nBrent A, Bracelin - Piper Sandler & Co. (Broker): Great. That's encouraging. And just one quick follow-up for Brian, if I could. We're seeing more talk of statewide deals. And I don't think we kind of really saw that in the past. As you look at the pipeline, is there a healthy amount of activity on more statewide deals? Just trying to understand that statewide deal trend that you've seen in Kansas, Washington State, North Carolina. I'd just love to hear the pipeline of activity around kind of statewide and what's driving that. Thanks.\nBrian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes. I'd say it's a little bit of a mixed bag. State is certainly an area that today is probably less than 15% of our revenue \u2013 somewhere between 10% and 15%. And I think it represents in the long-term, a big growth opportunity for us as we expand \u2013 move some of our products upmarket into the state and sell some of our products that are used locally, sell them statewide. We've had some really good examples of that in the last couple of years. Our school bus transportation system Versatrans had a great statewide deal in the Carolinas. North Carolina, adopting Brazos and our new e-warrants solution statewide, where those have typically been purchased at the local level, and they did that in conjunction with implementing our Odyssey court system statewide. Just this quarter, we had a significant win with our probation system with the state of Nevada. It's the first time we've had a state-level contract for that product, and that's a product we acquired about a year ago. So, and obviously with Odyssey, we've had a significant statewide presence where a lot of court systems, maybe 40 of the 50 state court systems \u2013 court systems are operated at the state level \u2013 and we've had great success there over the years. So I do expect we'll continue to build on that. In our Federal division, the MicroPact business we acquired a little over a year ago, that I'd say right now, probably the greatest pressure they're seeing is in their state market. But I think that's really a short-term phenomenon, and that's really around budget pressures. But we do expect to grow our state business and certainly our federal business as we expand beyond our traditional focus just on local government.\nBrent A, Bracelin - Piper Sandler & Co. (Broker): Helpful color there. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Wilson with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Wilson - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the call. Maybe first for Lynn, to better understand kind of what's informing your expectation for better revenue growth, but still kind of growth below your target 9%, 10%, 11% next year. Can you comment on what you're seeing in your end market in terms of RFP activity? Are you starting to see that come back or is it still below historical levels? And has there been any change in the types of RFPs that are coming to market, maybe in terms of size or the products that are in demand in the current environment?\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes. So again, we're still early in our process. What we're seeing in RFP activity, again, it's sort of mirrors what we're seeing right now across Tyler. There are certain areas that we're not feeling the impact. It's \u2013 the delays are shorter. The pipe is there. The RFP activity is still pretty good. It's a little softer in a few areas. And part of it's recognizing that the time from RFP to getting a deal done, it does take time. You're certainly aware of our sales cycle. So it is a \u2013 it's very preliminary right now, but we do drill down. We look \u2013 we build bottoms-up budgets \u2013 we look at RFP. We look at all those leading indicators, RFPs and demos and things like that, even RFIs. And so that's really what it's based on right now, but again, it's preliminary.\nScott Wilson - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Got it. Understood. And then maybe a quick one for Brian. To put a finer point on kind of your margin expansion commentary. I guess, historically, you've talked about 50 to 100 bps of margin expansion annually. Is that still in the cards for next year given the outsized expansion you've seen this year? Or should we be kind of thinking about maybe a more modest step back in terms of that type of expansion next year?\nBrian K. Miller - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Again, we've got a lot of work to do on our planning process, but I would say we \u2013 and even pre-COVID \u2013 we expected that 2021 would be a year where we would return to margin expansion. And so if I were guessing, I'd say probably in that range, but probably on the lower end.\nScott Wilson - RBC Capital Markets LLC: Makes sense. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Goodwin of JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Goodwin - JMP Securities LLC: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Just curious on \u2013 when you're doing a conversion from an on-premise customer into the cloud or subscription, do \u2013 and I understand this might vary across products, across Tyler. But is there \u2013 do customers need to be on a specific version before actually moving to the cloud or under the subscription? Is there any dynamic there or can they go from any version direct to the cloud? Thank you.\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Yes. No, there's not a \u2013 they don't need to be upgraded to the most current version to make that transition.\nJoe Goodwin - JMP Securities LLC: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: At this time, there appears to be no further questions. Mr. Moore, I'll turn back to you for any closing remarks.\nH. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.: Okay. Thanks, Eric, and thanks everybody for joining us today. I certainly appreciate the interest, and we hope you stay safe and healthy. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded.

Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn? Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2020. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. Although our revenues continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we were pleased to return to positive revenue growth this quarter. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $285.7 million, up 3.8%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $285.9 million, up 3.2%. Organic revenue growth was 3.3% on a GAAP basis and 2.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Our core software license and subscription revenues grew \u2013 combined grew \u2013 8.1% on a non-GAAP basis with 7.8% organic growth. Subscription revenues for the quarter increased 18.6%. We added 114 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a quarterly high of 46 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $56 million in total contract value. In Q3 of last year, we added 150 new subscription-based arrangements and had 20 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $47 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 47% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 51% in Q3 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 4.3 years compared to 2.7 years in Q3 of last year. Revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, were $23.2 million, up 9%. That amount includes e-filing revenues of $15.1 million, up 2.5% over last year and e-payments revenues of $8.1 million, up 23.6%. Transaction-based revenues were negatively impacted by reduced operations at some clients as a result of the pandemic. For the third quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $830 million, up 11%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q3 was approximately $265 million, up 21.6%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $93 million, up 9%, and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $472 million, up 6.2%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.55 billion, up 9.2%. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were strong at $292 million, up 12.9%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.3 billion, up 5.4% against a tough comparison that includes the two large North Carolina courts deals totaling approximately $105 million in the prior trailing 12 months. Our software subscription bookings in the third quarter added $9.9 million in new annual recurring revenue. Cash flow from operations increased 30.5% to $169. 8 million and free cash flow grew 34.8% to $165.4 million, both new quarterly highs. In fact, year-to-date, our free cash flow has already surpassed our best full year free cash flow by more than 9%. We ended the quarter with approximately $650 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Our guidance for the full year of 2020 is as follows. We expect 2020 GAAP revenues will be between $1.117 billion and $1.129 billion, and non-GAAP revenues will be between $1.118 billion and $1.130 billion. We expect 2020 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.53 and $4.63 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2020 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.48 and $5.58. For the year, estimated pre-tax non-cash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $77 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be between $88 million and $90 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 41.5 million and 42 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of negative 12% after discrete tax items, and includes approximately $65 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. Our estimated non-GAAP effective \u2013 annual effective tax rate for 2020 is 24%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be between $30 million and $31 million for the year, including approximately $10 million related to real estate and approximately $6 million of capitalized software development costs. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $81 million, including approximately $54 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Lynn for some additional comments. And I'd add one other thing. I think what you were alluding to there is, there does seem to be bipartisan efforts to provide more funding, specifically for state and local government IT upgrades. There was an act \u2013 The State and Local IT Modernization and Cybersecurity Act that was proposed back in August \u2013 and that act would provide $28 billion over the next five years, specifically to upgrade government IT systems. So, the upgrading of systems is certainly something that the federal government recognizes is important. Yes. And as we work through our planning for next year, we'll have a better idea of how those \u2013 how much of it is actually sustainable. Coming into the year, pre-COVID, we had had a goal kind of holding margins flat with last year after a couple of down years as a result of our significant increases in R&D. We've continued to spend R&D pretty close to what we expected for the year, but we're now up \u2013 this quarter \u2013 up 300 basis points. I don't expect that the margin growth will be as high in Q4 or that we'll see 300 basis points next year. But we do expect that we'll be back on a margin expansion opportunity in that a significant part of the gains, although they've come about because of COVID, we've been able to change business practices, particularly remote delivery of services, changing the way we approach some things like trade shows, eliminating a lot of administrative travel that I think will be permanent gains. So, if you look at the 300 basis points we picked up this quarter, maybe as much as half of that would be a sustainable kind of a gain. Sure. Yes, if you look at the change in our full year revenue guidance, I believe the midpoint of our guidance came down by about $11 million compared to where that was when we reinitiated guidance after Q2. About $4 million of that is what we talked about earlier on the call related to the IT security incident where we lost primarily services revenues, some license revenues, as a result of a lack of ability to interface with clients while our systems were compromised. There's about $1 million related to lower e-filing volumes, as courts have not reopened as fast as we anticipated at the end of Q2. A lot of e-filing volume is around evictions and debt collections. And as you know, there's \u2013 the CDC has now put in place a broader moratorium on evictions and so those volumes are lower than we expected. And then there's about roughly $8 million of an effect on licenses, which are primarily sales delays, processes being pushed out, and that's a combination really of COVID and its impact on our clients' ability to work remotely, and budget pressures (39:18) as well. So those are \u2013 and then lastly \u2013 licenses are also being affected by a greater shift towards SaaS in our pipeline than even we anticipated at the end of the second quarter, for the reasons we talked about, Lynn talked about earlier on the call. Well, a big piece of that, both at the gross and operating margin is the absence of billable travel, which has essentially no margin on it. And so that continues to \u2013 that loss of that revenue continues to be \u2013 have a positive impact. That's probably the biggest point. The other thing is we are seeing, as we move to the remote delivery of services, we actually gain utilization and efficiency there because we're not putting people on airplanes every Monday and every Friday, and we're able to use that time to deliver services. And so, that shift is having a positive impact as well. And that is something that we expect to be sustainable. Although certainly in the future, there will be some billable travel and some return to on-site services, we believe that in the long-term, we'll continue to deliver a significant amount of services remotely as our experience over the last two or three quarters is proving that that can be done very effectively and clients are increasingly accepting of that model. Yes. I'd say it's a little bit of a mixed bag. State is certainly an area that today is probably less than 15% of our revenue \u2013 somewhere between 10% and 15%. And I think it represents in the long-term, a big growth opportunity for us as we expand \u2013 move some of our products upmarket into the state and sell some of our products that are used locally, sell them statewide. We've had some really good examples of that in the last couple of years. Our school bus transportation system Versatrans had a great statewide deal in the Carolinas. North Carolina, adopting Brazos and our new e-warrants solution statewide, where those have typically been purchased at the local level, and they did that in conjunction with implementing our Odyssey court system statewide. Just this quarter, we had a significant win with our probation system with the state of Nevada. It's the first time we've had a state-level contract for that product, and that's a product we acquired about a year ago. So, and obviously with Odyssey, we've had a significant statewide presence where a lot of court systems, maybe 40 of the 50 state court systems \u2013 court systems are operated at the state level \u2013 and we've had great success there over the years. So I do expect we'll continue to build on that. In our Federal division, the MicroPact business we acquired a little over a year ago, that I'd say right now, probably the greatest pressure they're seeing is in their state market. But I think that's really a short-term phenomenon, and that's really around budget pressures. But we do expect to grow our state business and certainly our federal business as we expand beyond our traditional focus just on local government.\nBrent A, Bracelin - Piper Sandler & Co. (Broker): Helpful color there. Thank you. Again, we've got a lot of work to do on our planning process, but I would say we \u2013 and even pre-COVID \u2013 we expected that 2021 would be a year where we would return to margin expansion. And so if I were guessing, I'd say probably in that range, but probably on the lower end."

            "name": "H. Lynn Moore - Tyler Technologies, Inc.",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I'll have some preliminary comments and Brian will review the details of our third quarter results. Then, I'll have some additional comments and we'll take questions. Brian? Thanks, Brian. We were pleased with our third quarter results as we continue to execute at a high level, particularly in light of the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. After we experienced our first year-over-year decline in quarterly revenues in almost a decade, we returned to revenue growth this quarter, driven by strength in recurring revenues. We have not experienced any meaningful cancellations, but longer sales cycles and delays in projects as clients deal with the effects of the pandemic, along with the near elimination of billable travel, led to declines in software license, professional services and appraisal service revenues. However, GAAP subscription revenues grew a robust 18.6% and non-GAAP subscription revenues grew 18%. We continued to experience significant savings in operating expenses in the third quarter, in part driven by the successful deployment of more efficient service delivery and operating models. As a result, our operating margins expanded significantly with our non-GAAP operating margin up 300 basis points to 28.6%. And our adjusted EBITDA was a new quarterly record at $89 million. Cash flow has also been very robust throughout the year, and both cash from operations and free cash flow reached new quarterly highs in the third quarter. It was also a strong quarter for bookings, which rose almost 13%. While the number of new deals was down, the average deal size and total new contract value both were up compared to last year. It was a strong quarter for new business for our Justice solutions as we closed some large contracts after extended sales processes. Our largest deal in the quarter was a license arrangement with the Washington State Courts of Limited Jurisdiction, valued at approximately $15 million for our Odyssey Court Case Management and Caseload Pro Probation Solutions, including e-filing. We also signed significant Justice solutions contract with Dallas County, Texas, including a license arrangement for our Odyssey Solution for criminal and justice of the peace courts valued at approximately $8 million and a SaaS arrangement for our Jury Management Solution valued at approximately $1.6 million. Also, for our Odyssey solution, we signed a license arrangement with Saginaw County, Michigan, and notable SaaS deals with the city of Akron, Ohio and the Texas counties of Guadalupe, Leon, Gillespie and Erath (4:31). We also signed the first state-level contract for our Tyler Supervision product, formerly known as Caseload Pro, with the state of Nevada. Our Public Safety division continues to expand its market with the year-to-date average deal size up 92% over last year. This expansion reflects our increasing competitiveness upmarket as well as an increase in the breadth of products in many deals. Our Public Safety division had never signed two contracts with licenses greater than $1 million each in the same quarter until this quarter, when we signed large contracts with Sedgwick County, Kansas and the City of Laredo, Texas. We also signed a multi-suite contract with Ellis County, Kansas for our New World Public Safety, Odyssey Courts, Socrata Data & Insights and Brazos Solutions and contracts with the city of Brownsville, Texas and Des Moines, Iowa for our Public Safety and Socrata Data & Insight Solutions. Our largest SaaS deal in the quarter was a $6 million contract with the city of Tigard, Oregon in the port \u2013 excuse me \u2013 in the Portland metropolitan area for our Munis ERP and EnerGov Civic Services solutions. We also signed notable SaaS deals for our Munis ERP solution with the city of Fairfield, California; Champaign County, Illinois; the Virginia Railway Express; the city of Thomasville, Georgia, and a license arrangement with the city of Christiansburg, Virginia. Other significant SaaS deals for our EnerGov Civic Services solution were the cities of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida and Yonkers, New York. Finally, it was also a strong quarter for new business in our federal space with several new contracts, most notably with the D.C. Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs, The Counter Trade Products and the Fish and Wildlife Service, both departments within the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services. As we reported in a Form 8-K filed on September 29, we discovered early on September 23 that an unauthorized third-party intruder had disrupted access to some of our internal phone and IT systems. As soon as we discovered this, we shut down points of access to external systems out of an abundance of caution. We immediately activated our internal incident response plan, which included taking impacted systems offline to further contain the spread. We confirmed that the malicious software the intruder use was ransomware. We are following strict protocols laid out by industry standard incident response directives. Because of this, we are being careful not to share certain details around the incident until the investigation is finished. However, there is some information I can share with you today. From the morning of September 23, our incident response efforts have been facilitated by Tyler's internal resources as well as third-party providers. Those third-party providers include FireEye Mandiant, a nationally recognized incident response provider. We also have been actively cooperating with law enforcement. Our initial analysis has continued to prove correct. The impact of the incident was directed at our internal corporate network and phone systems. There has been no evidence of compromise in the separate and segregated environments where we host software for our clients. And to date, there has been no evidence of malicious activity on client self-hosted systems related to this incident. From day one, we have been regularly communicating with our client community and have actively maintained an incident response page on our website. We encourage you to check for updates there as well. In addition to the containment, recovery and remediation efforts we have undertaken, Tyler has also taken steps to supplement the existing multilayered security monitoring, scanning and antivirus protocols already in place. We are committed to completing our full forensics investigation and taking all appropriate actions in response to our findings. The security incident did impact our ability to deliver licenses and services during late September and into October. We currently estimate the impact to revenue was approximately $1.5 million in the third quarter and $2.5 million in the fourth quarter. We maintained cybersecurity insurance coverage in amount that we believe is adequate. I want to reiterate that what I have just shared with you represents the information we can share at this point, given where we're at in the stage of our investigation and the recovery process. We will not be addressing the incident further on today's call, and we will not take questions on the incident itself or our investigation. I would, however, like to express my gratitude to all Tyler employees, who once again displayed the heart of Tyler in their response and handling of the security incident, especially our internal IT teams that worked around the clock with an aggressive and coordinated response to recover and remediate our internal systems. As with our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tyler demonstrated the resiliency that comes from strong and well-designed business processes and corporate governance practices. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter. Thanks, Brian. With the challenges our clients face as a result of the spread of COVID-19, our clients' need for digital connectedness, both within their organizations and directly with the public is rapidly shifting from a vision to an urgent requirement. We're gratified by the accolades Tyler is receiving for our innovations to help our clients address the challenges of the current environment. During the third quarter, our Virtual Court solution, which has been selected by approximately 60 courts nationwide, received the AWS Best Remote Work Solution award in conjunction with its use in the city of Alvin, Texas. We also won the Coolest Overall Technology Innovation Award from School Technology (sic) [Transportation] (17:21) News for our new bus attendance application, which works with Tyler's bus routing solutions to provide schools a tool for limiting bus capacity, contact tracing and social distancing on the school bus. On the product development front, we are continuing all of our strategic initiatives, including product R&D projects, and accelerating our move to the cloud and still expect that R&D expense will grow at more than 9% for the year. While some of our competitors are laying off staff, we continue to add new employees to support long-term growth opportunities, and we added 27 net new heads during the third quarter, mostly in product development. We also continue to adapt our operations, providing client support and delivering professional services such as training remotely and executing complex go-lives virtually, improving utilization and eliminating most travel costs. Many administrative and sales and marketing activities, including sales demos, trade shows and user group meetings are also being conducted virtually with reductions in associated expenses. We continue to explore the possibility of greater numbers of employees working remotely, even after our offices fully reopen. Lower expenses have more than offset revenue reductions relative to our pre-COVID plan, resulting in margin expansion. Some of these expense reductions, such as sales commissions and health claims are short-term in nature, but we do expect that some savings will be sustainable. As a result, we expect to continue to see year-over-year margin expansion in the fourth quarter. We expect that revenue growth for the fourth quarter will continue to be significantly impacted by the pandemic, and to a much lesser extent, the IT security incident. Although our variable revenue streams will continue to be affected by the current environment, we anticipate that recurring revenues, which comprise more than 70% of our total revenues, will continue to be relatively unaffected. While we remain confident in our long-term outlook, there are uncertainties around the continuously evolving COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations and those of our clients. For example, government response to the pandemic continued to vary significantly from state-to-state and even from jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction within a state, thereby making the duration and scope of business restrictions within the public sector difficult to predict. Many public sector entities are facing near-term budget pressures that could cause them to delay spending in the coming year. The COVID-19 pandemic has not changed our view of the underlying fundamentals and long-term demand for our software. If anything, the current crisis is highlighting the unsustainable reliance on outdated technology by much of the public sector. Technology is an increasingly critical factor in helping government function effectively, especially in difficult times. While it is too soon to fully assess the impact of the elections, we expect that additional federal stimulus will be forthcoming to provide further economic aid to state and local governments. We are confident that new long-term opportunities will emerge from this crisis, as both Tyler and our clients reexamine historical business practices. And that Tyler is better positioned than our competitors to provide innovative solutions to help our clients meet new challenges. Our balance sheet is stronger than ever, with $650 million in cash and investments and no debt. We plan to continue to invest at a high level in R&D and actively pursue M&A opportunities to broaden our total addressable market and build on our strong competitive position. I continue to be extremely proud and inspired by how the entire Tyler team has risen to face the challenges of this year head on, supporting our clients as well as each other. We are confident in the fundamental strengths of the public sector market and our ability to grow and invest in strategic initiatives in a difficult environment, and we look forward to executing our long-term strategies until conditions allow us to return to a higher growth market. Now, we'll take questions. Yeah, sure, Pete. And you're right. I think generally speaking, there's an expectation that there's going to be another round of stimulus. I think both political parties agree on that. I think for certain that the last month or so, maybe two months, it's become a little bit more of a politicized issue that I think will get behind us, now that the election is behind us. In fact, I read an article this morning where Mitch McConnell in the Senate said that getting a stimulus passed by the end of the year was his new top priority as well as \u2013 and he made a comment specifically \u2013 as well as state and local government stimulus. So, I think that's coming. I think that's the expectation. It's hard to know exactly where everything's going to shake out, but I do think it will become a priority following this election, once things settle out a little bit more. I think I talked about last time \u2013 at the last call \u2013 the prior Fed Chairman Bernanke, he made a comment coming out of the Great Recession, that one of the things that they, I think, sort of missed the boat on was they did not devote enough money to state and local governments when they were doing their stimulus then. I think that's a significant priority. We've also talked about the Fed has specific bond buying programs for counties and cities, and I think that's going to continue. So, the expectation is there. I think the expectations for our clients, I think there's \u2013 that's part of the hesitancy going on right now \u2013 but I see that coming on the horizon. Yeah, Pete, I think that's a good question. And the short answer is yes. And what we've seen, generally is, we've seen a little bit of difference in terms of bit of difference in terms of different market segments but public safety the demand's still there. We expect some significant deals to still come through in the fourth quarter. I think one of the things that's encouraging about public safety is as we continue to invest and we've added more portfolio of products to their bag, is that, historically, the fourth quarter was \u2013 was one that was, I think, a little more skewed towards their license deals and it still is. But as that business grows and as it gains traction, we're starting to sort of level that out a bit. We've had, as we noted, we had for the first time ever two license deals over $1 million in Q3, which is pretty incredible. In fact, now I think it's now three of the last four quarters, we've had license deals in excess of $1.5 million. So the momentum's there in public safety. It's funny, I think 10 days from now will be our five year anniversary of acquiring that, and I think it's a testament to the work that those people have put in and the investments we've put in. And we talk about how it takes a little bit of time with some of these investments, these acquisitions, and they're really starting to hit their stride; they're doing a great job. Yes. So \u2013 and you \u2013 I don't want to go into too much more detail. But the short answer is, as we talked about, the incident was really all about our internal systems. It was about our phone systems, our website and things of that nature. However, out of abundance of caution, what we, as I mentioned in my comments, what we did was we immediately shut down all external points of entry. So, that disrupted things like being able to conduct \u2013 we do a lot of services \u2013 support was disrupted. We weren't able to send e-mails with attachments for a while. And really that, again, that was just out of abundance of caution. So, it was really short term. To your second question, as it relates to pipeline, it has not had any impact really on our pipeline. There was obviously a little short-term disruption, but we haven't seen anything meaningful in terms of future impact of sales or anything like that. Yeah, so I would say two things. As it relates to schools, in particular, I'd say that's one area right now where budget impacts is sort of constraining some deals from moving forward; it's pushing some things out. At the same time, you're right. It's absolutely highlighting \u2013 and this goes beyond schools \u2013 it's highlighting the need for technology. I think when I look at the business overall of the public sector, I think the shift that we're starting to see, that part of it's due to COVID, but it's new, more online, mobile, public access \u2013 things that are interaction with the parents, with the schools \u2013 but even more just citizens engaging with their communities. That's something that's going to continue. And I think that was the future anyway, but I think COVID has really sort of accelerated that. So, and I think what's encouraging about that to me, Matt, is that Tyler really is out in the forefront of this. We're the best positioned for this. This brings in our whole Connected Communities vision and things that we're already doing. And so it really puts us in a great position when things \u2013 when we sort of get on the other side of this. Yes. Sure, Charlie. And I guess I'd start off by saying \u2013 and we talked about on the last call \u2013 is we don't see any real meaningful change in our pipeline. We know the demand for our services don't go away. We remember how we started the year in the first quarter before it hit. We were out to a really great start and so we sort of expect that to continue. At the same time, we also talked about we're in the middle of these June 30, July 1 budget cycles right now. So my expectation is that there will be some hangover. still be some delays in some deals, still some clients that are reluctant to open up and do some remote delivery of services. We're still waiting to see courts opening back up, so some of our transaction volumes kick up. I'd say stepping back on a high side, just sort of generally, you're right. We are in the budget process right now. It is a little bit early. I'd say on the revenue side, I would expect revenue growth to be higher than what it's been in 2020, but probably not a full return to sort of our pre-COVID expectations of high single digits, 9%, 10%, 11% growth. But I do expect it to be better than this year. But that's kind of where we are on the revenue side. Yes. Sure, Charlie. And yes, we're always \u2013 we've talked before \u2013 we're always looking at deals and that's continued. That has not slowed down during COVID. In fact, one of the things that we've done over the last six months, you probably remember us talking about over the last couple of years is our white space initiative. We've actually taken the time, dived a little deeper, refined that, and really making that forefront. We're going to continue to be opportunistic on those deals. But we're out there, we're looking. I would like to see us do some deals, and so we're out there looking. We are. We've gotten, as you mentioned, we \u2013 I think some of the initial traction was in Texas. We're seeing some good things on the West Coast in California. I think what's particularly encouraging is this continued move-up market, which is also part of the fact that we're \u2013 the Tyler Alliance story \u2013 the total Tyler story is really starting to resonate. The largest deal they did this quarter was Sedgwick County, Kansas, that was about a $1.6 million license deal. And that was a full suite of CAD, enterprise records, but also pulling through things \u2013 SoftCode, our field reporting, Tyler Corrections, Brazos, Socrata, Mobility \u2013 all these things. And that's part of that strategy as well. And I think the key selling point there was really the whole Tyler Alliance story. And that's what \u2013 that's the feedback we've gotten from the field and the client. And that's what's also encouraging because as we know, there's \u2013 there isn't anybody else out there that can compete on that level. And in fact, the competitor we had in that was Motorola. So it's particularly gratifying to see these strategies start to play out and start to win these bigger deals, which include going upmarket as you \u2013 but also as you say \u2013 leveraging other Tyler relationships, other Tyler products to get these deals. Yes, Jonathan, I think that's a good observation. And I think going in \u2013 pre-COVID \u2013 we were already starting to see this shift in the market and I think that was going to continue on its own anyway. I think, secondly, as we've talked about over the last year plus or two years, as Tyler has shifted its approach from more of a cloud agnostic to more cloud preferred or cloud first, we're doing things with how we do our sales and how we inform clients. And so, I think that's been part of it. But absolutely, COVID has played a role there. And we're seeing that really across all of our divisions. I mean we're seeing it \u2013 our Munis ERP \u2013 they're all coming in right now at rates, subscription rates that were higher than their original 2020 plan. And so that's definitely occurring, and again, the good news is that we've been preparing for it and ready for it and we've been investing towards there. So it's a short-term headwind, continues to be, but that trend is going to continue, I believe. Yes, Keith, that's a good observation. I think that's right. That's certainly our expectation. I mean, even though courts have been starting to reopen some, as Brian mentioned, there has been this moratorium. And really about almost two-thirds of court filings are either debt-related or landlord-tenant eviction type things. So, our expectation is that, that will go up. Even when you look at sort of on the more municipal side or traffic side, you don't have a lot of citations out there. You don't have a lot of people paying court fines and things like that on the \u2013 more on the municipal side \u2013 but we would expect that those will return to normal. But in terms of the backlog on the civil side, yes, I think that's our current expectation. Yes, Scott, it's actually \u2013 it's quite a number of factors. And I want to be clear, is through last four quarters, we've had license deals in excess of $1.5 million, which is even better. And you're right, it's \u2013 we've done a lot over the last several years, both in terms of expanding our functionality. We're now responding to more RFPs, than we could before. We're more compliant than we were before. So, we've made the product much more robust. In addition, it's hard to underestimate, really what we've done on the service side as well, really shoring up client references. As we've introduced these new products, CAD and e-records, the number of go-lives that have been successful, in getting those references, that's the stuff we don't spend a lot of time talking about. But one of the biggest initiatives this year was our e-records which was going about (45:52) the same as the CAD. They had, I think, 15 big go-lives scheduled for this year and a number of those had pushed back a little bit just because of COVID, but we're on track to get all those done. We've had 11 of them successful. And that's the hard stuff and it's that referenceability. But then when you talk about, again, moving upmarket, it's all these tuck-in acquisitions and integrating them. It's these things like SceneDoc, SoftCode, Brazos, Socrata. And what you don't ever know is, in these big deals, you never know exactly what's the tipping point. But our \u2013 what we can deliver, the full suite of products \u2013 is so much more competitive and then it's so much more broader than what other people are offering that it just becomes very compelling. So, I would say the area where we're seeing probably more delays is really on the higher end of the ERP space, more of our Munis line. It's interesting the lower end is not seeing the same right now. But then again, stepping back, it was that high-end ERP space that really got out of the gate fast in Q1 and that's what's still so encouraging. We've talked about how the demand didn't go away. What seems to be happening there, as opposed to say, in our Justice solutions or even the lower end space, is that some counties \u2013 there's that uncertainty out there \u2013 but they just seem to be a little bit more willing to push it out a little bit further, or I'd say, hang on another year. I'd almost analogize it to \u2013 you've got a car, an old car you've had since college \u2013 and you've got a couple of kids and a spouse and that car's starting to spend more time in the shop than on the road. And you know it's time to get that thing fixed, but golly, your kids who have braces coming up this year or something happening with one of your jobs. You say, I'm going to hang on one more year before I do it. And I think we're seeing that there more so than, say, on the other sides of the business. Yeah, sure, Kirk. I think we're doing a little bit of that, and we're doing a little bit of that with some of these products that we're really planning to try to introduce this year or that we really were expecting to sort of jump start this year. And I'm not talking about our major core apps, but some of our smaller products around that, be it \u2013 we talked before about at Socrata Data & Insights or our product called Executive Insights. We're doing things there like offering one-year free Premier Executive Insight. We've talked about it with virtual courts. We've done these free trial periods. We're doing things like that around our Tyler Detect, which is our cybersecurity, our research, taxes, things like that. So, we are seeing some of that right now. In terms of \"gaining market share\", I think the things that we're doing right now by keeping our investments at the level and accelerating some of them being in that position to really capitalize, knowing that we went into this already in probably the strongest position in the market. And the way I view it, really, Kirk, is that as we're dealing with the effects of this pandemic \u2013 and we know it's going to end and we know the demand is going to be there \u2013 but every quarter that goes by, Tyler itself is getting stronger and stronger. Our balance sheet is getting stronger. We're investing. Every quarter goes by, we're another quarter down in our R&D and further along in our investments. We don't believe our competitors are doing the same. And so, I really like our position right now. And yeah, we're looking at things like that on some of these products we're trying to jump start, but we're not really doing that really across our core apps right now. I'd say that in terms of the sort of number of deals we look at, it's probably kind of consistent with what we were before. I haven't seen any really increased activity there. I think my expectation, if you go back to the Q1 call, my expectation might have been \u2013 you might have seen more on the valuation front. I think some of them may have come down a little bit, but the broader market is still doing pretty well. I'm talking about the public markets and sometimes people tend to point to that when they shouldn't. But we haven't seen any meaningful expectations right now out of valuation, probably about the same as before. Yeah, I think that's right. I mean, I do believe the shift to how government's going to operate, how they're going to deliver services to their citizens, I believe that was going to change pre-COVID, and I think it's going to change and accelerate past that. And one of the things I talk about is, you look at your kids and you look at how they think about technology and how they use technology, well, they're going to grow up. They're the citizens of the future \u2013 they're citizens today, but they're the ones that are \u2013 they're going to demand more. They're going to demand that government works the way everything else in their lives work. Earlier this week, I was \u2013 I did an interview for the National League of Cities. We talked with Clarence Anthony, the CEO there, and this is for their upcoming user conference. We spent a lot of time talking about the cloud and the local government shift and move to the cloud. And to me, it's something that's coming. It was coming anyway. I think COVID is accelerating that. And you talk about budget constraints. I mean, that's one of the factors about that. You've got, as you move to the cloud, you do create some budget certainty. You take away sort of some of the uncertainties of these large capital spends. You talk about security in today's world. We spent a lot of time talking about cybersecurity. And the cloud is such a more secure environment and you're dealing with these players like AWS who we're aligned with, they've got all kinds of resources to spend on that infrastructure, and that's their business. And that's not really that's not really a local government's business. And so \u2013 and I think they're starting to recognize that. And so, I do think the shift is real and I do think it's accelerating.\nBrent A, Bracelin - Piper Sandler & Co. (Broker): Great. That's encouraging. And just one quick follow-up for Brian, if I could. We're seeing more talk of statewide deals. And I don't think we kind of really saw that in the past. As you look at the pipeline, is there a healthy amount of activity on more statewide deals? Just trying to understand that statewide deal trend that you've seen in Kansas, Washington State, North Carolina. I'd just love to hear the pipeline of activity around kind of statewide and what's driving that. Thanks. Yes. So again, we're still early in our process. What we're seeing in RFP activity, again, it's sort of mirrors what we're seeing right now across Tyler. There are certain areas that we're not feeling the impact. It's \u2013 the delays are shorter. The pipe is there. The RFP activity is still pretty good. It's a little softer in a few areas. And part of it's recognizing that the time from RFP to getting a deal done, it does take time. You're certainly aware of our sales cycle. So it is a \u2013 it's very preliminary right now, but we do drill down. We look \u2013 we build bottoms-up budgets \u2013 we look at RFP. We look at all those leading indicators, RFPs and demos and things like that, even RFIs. And so that's really what it's based on right now, but again, it's preliminary. Yes. No, there's not a \u2013 they don't need to be upgraded to the most current version to make that transition. Okay. Thanks, Eric, and thanks everybody for joining us today. I certainly appreciate the interest, and we hope you stay safe and healthy. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks, everybody."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is recorded today, July 30, 2020. I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Moore. Please go ahead.\nLynn Moore: Thank you, Danielle, and welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, I'll have some preliminary comments, and Brian will review the details of our second quarter results. Then I'll have some additional comments, and we'll take questions.\nBrian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. We executed at a high level during the second quarter, as the effects of COVID-19 pandemic continued. From a financial perspective, GAAP revenues declined 1.5%, and non-GAAP revenues declined 2.4%. Revenues for the quarter were approximately $35 million below our pre-COVID plan. Many procurement processes encountered delays, as clients focused on addressing COVID-19, resulting in several contracts being pushed out of the quarter, reducing license and, to a lesser extent, subscription revenues. Also, services revenue was negatively impacted during the quarter as billable travel was essentially eliminated and fewer hours were delivered as we transition to providing most services remotely. As I noted on our last earnings call, due to concerns with COVID-19, our annual Connect user conference was canceled. And although a majority of the content was delivered virtually, we lost more than $6 million of revenue that would have been recognized in the second quarter. Recurring revenues remained strong. GAAP subscription revenues grew 16.6%, and non-GAAP subscription revenues grew 15.6%. Together, total recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions grew 12.3% on a GAAP basis and comprise approximately 75% of total revenues. On the positive side, operating expenses were also well below our original plan. We experienced significant savings in commissions, travel, marketing, health claims and other employee-related expenses. As a result, our operating margins expanded, with our non-GAAP operating margin up 290 basis points to 27.5%. Our cash flow was another high point in our results, with free cash flow up 226% over last year's second quarter. Bookings for the quarter were approximately $309 million, and as expected, declined 31.6% due to the very difficult comparison to the second quarter of 2019, which included 2 very large SaaS deals, 1 for the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts, and the other with Bayer County, Texas. Excluding these two contracts, bookings declined approximately 10.9%. Although we have not seen meaningful cancellations, we are seeing delays in procurement processes and lengthening sales cycles due to the effects of COVID-19, which impacted bookings this quarter. As we have discussed in the past, our new deal mix can be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, as was the case this quarter. The number of new software deals was weighted towards SaaS, with 66% of the total. However, the value of the new software deal is weighed towards on-premise license arrangements at 57%, as more of the larger deals that signed this quarter chose on-premises. Our largest deal in the quarter was a license arrangement with the state of West Virginia, valued at approximately $9 million for our iasWorld Appraisal solution, including appraisal services. Perhaps the most significant contract signed in the quarter was a public safety arrangement with Jacksonville, Florida, for our New World Public Safety records management and Brazos eCitation solutions, along with our Socrata Data & Insights, SceneDoc and SoftCode solutions, valued at approximately $5 million. Jacksonville, the 13th largest city in the nation, represents our largest public safety client to date. This one is important because it not only validates the significant investments we've made in the New World suite to position it to become competitive in Tier 1, but also showcases the strategic value of the acquisitions we've made in recent years. Other notable license deals during the quarter included an Odyssey court case management contracts, with the 10th Judicial Court in Johnson County, Kansas, which completes our state-wide presence in Kansas. Along with contracts for our MicroPact entellitrak solution, with the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission and the United States Department of Agriculture. In fact, three of our seven largest license deals in the quarter were for our MicroPact entellitrak solutions. We added two new counties in California for Odyssey, a licensed contract with Calusa County and a SaaS contract with Mariposa County. We've now won six of six California court deals that have been executed since the state-provided new funding for case management system replacements last year. Our largest SaaS deal in the quarter was a $3 million contract with Clay County, Florida for our EnerGov Civic services solution. We also signed a SaaS deal for EnerGov with the city of Sunnyvale, California, valued at approximately $1.3 million. Other significant SaaS arrangements signed this quarter were with the Bellevue School District in the state of Washington and the City of Lynn, Massachusetts for our Munis ERP solution, with the Abu Dhabi Global markets for our Modria Online Dispute Resolution solution with the Kansas Supreme Court for our CaseloadPRO solution, and with Clearmount County, Ohio for our Socrata Data & Insight solution. In addition, 42 existing on-premises clients signed contracts to move to the cloud, including Oasis County, Texas, with Odyssey Courts; Franklin County, Ohio and the Cab County, Georgia, with iasWorld Appraisal & Tax; and Alameda County in California with CaseloadPRO supervision. We also delivered the initial version of our e-warrant system to the state of North Carolina under the contract we signed late in Q1. We also have trial programs underway for e-warrants with 2 counties in Texas. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter.\nBrian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2020. In our earnings release, we've included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. This was the first time we've had a year-over-year decline in quarterly revenue since the fourth quarter of 2010, just before we emerge from the effects of the Great Recession, and ended the streak of 34 quarters of double-digit revenue growth. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $271.1 million, down 1.5%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $271.3 million, down 2.4%. Organic revenue growth was down 1.9% on a GAAP basis and 2.8% on a non-GAAP basis. Our core software and license -- software license and subscription revenues combined, grew 8.4% on a non-GAAP basis with 7.7% organic growth. Total revenues were about $35 million below our pre-COVID plan. Of that, approximately $11 million was attributed to delayed license and percentage of completion revenues; $8 million to professional services; $6.6 million to the cancellation of Connect; $4.5 million to billable travel; and $1.4 million to lower e-filing volumes. Subscription revenues for the quarter increased 16.6%. We added 125 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 42 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $39 million in total contract value. In Q2 of last year, we added 154 new subscription-based arrangements and had 27 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $128 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 43% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 80% in Q2 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.7 years compared to 6.1 years last year, when the average term was skewed by the 10-year $85 million contract with North Carolina. Revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, were relatively flat with Q2 of last year at $21.3 million. That amount includes e-filing revenues of $14.2 million, down 1.8% over last year and e-payments revenue of $7.1 million, up 5%. Lower volumes as a result of closed court operations in some jurisdictions reduced our transaction-based e-filing revenues by an estimated $1.4 million in the quarter. For the second quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $810 million, up 10.7%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q2 was approximately $258 million, up 21.7%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $85 million, up 0.3%, and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $467 million, up 7.4%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.54 billion, up 7.4%. As Lynn noted, our bookings declined by 31.6% to approximately $309 million against a very difficult comparison with Q2 of 2019. Last year's second quarter bookings were a record $452 million and included the largest contract in our history, the $85 million SaaS contract for the North Carolina courts as well as a $20 million SaaS contract with the Bexar County, Texas courts. Excluding those contracts from last year, the decline in bookings was 10.9%. However, for the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.2 billion, up 3%. Our software subscription bookings in the quarter added $9.2 million in new annual recurring revenue. As in the first quarter, cash flows were very robust during the second quarter. Cash flows from operations increased 62.5% to $39.8 million, and free cash flow more than tripled to $31.5 million. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was negative as a result of discrete tax benefits related to stock compensation and lower cash taxes contributed to the cash flow growth. We ended the quarter with $473 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Our guidance for the full-year of 2020 is as follows: we expect 2020 GAAP revenues will be between $1.124 billion and $1.144 billion, and non-GAAP revenues will be between $1.125 billion and $1.145 billion. We expect 2020 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.71 and $4.91 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2020 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.30 and $5.50. For the year, estimated pretax noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $79 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be between $90 million and $92 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 41.5 million and 42 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of negative 23% after discrete tax items, includes approximately $82 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. Our estimated non-GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2020 is 24%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be between $34 million and $35 million for the year, including approximately $10 million related to real estate and approximately $6 million of capitalized software development costs. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $81 million, including approximately $54 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Lynn for some additional comments.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. I want to provide an update on how Tyler Technologies is approaching the challenge of COVID-19 and its effects on our business and our clients. First, our operational response. Tyler's 5,500 professionals continue to provide a high standard of client service with minimal disruption. Our primary focus continues to be on ensuring that our employees and their families are safe and healthy, while supporting clients who provide essential services to the public. Since mid-March, almost all of our staff have worked from home, with all but the most crucial travel eliminated. Our clients have faced disruption to their operations, as they deal with the effects of the pandemic on their communities and, in some places, civil unrest and focus on providing vital services to their citizens. Since March, we have seen delays in some procurement processes, although most late-stage processes are moving forward. Some implementation appraisal service projects have also encountered delays, as clients grapple with balancing social distancing orders with conducting daily operations. We've imposed travel restrictions on our employees, which has all but eliminated our ability to provide services on-site and to visit prospective clients for sales calls and demos. Virtually every trade show has been canceled, as was our Tyler Connect user conference scheduled for late April. We are addressing the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic by adapting the way we do business, including using web and video conferencing extensively for collaboration, conducting sales demos, providing client support and delivering professional services such as training remotely, and even executing complex go-lives virtually. With the spread of COVID-19, our clients' need for digital connectedness, both within their organizations and directly with the public, is rapidly shifting from a vision to an urgent requirement. In the last few months, we have seen numerous examples of our team members working to help our clients adapt to the current environment in truly amazing ways. I'd like to highlight a few examples. Following the cancellation of Connect, we offered much of the valuable content to all of our clients through a program called Still Connected, a series of live and recorded online sessions. We've delivered more than 320 sessions of content with 17,000 views of recorded webinars, enabling us to reach even more client personnel than would have attended Connect in person. We accelerated the launch of our new virtual court solution, which provides a turnkey platform built on AWS for conducting face-to-face court sessions with remote defendants over the web. We have offered it without charge for 90 days in order to help clients serve their constituents without interruption. 46 courts are now live, using the solution to handle cases remotely, while also broadening access to justice for disadvantaged or displaced defendants, and 18 additional courts are in the process of onboarding. And just yesterday, AWS recognized virtual court as the best remote work solution in the AWS 2020 public sector partner awards. Developers on our Versatrans team fast track development of a new bus attendants app that works with our school bus routing solutions to provide schools with a tool for limiting bus capacity and managing social distancing as well as facilitating contact tracing. Our Appraisal & Tax division worked with clients with active revaluation projects underway, including Delaware County, Pennsylvania and Franklin County, Ohio, to move to remote property valuation hearings. We've also pivoted from infield data collection work to using remote data to achieve equitable and repeatable property assessments that support vital property tax revenue streams for our clients. We successfully completed more than 180 go-lives across our product groups during the quarter, most with very few or no Tyler personnel on site. The port of Long Beach, California, the second busiest seaport in the U.S., became our third public safety client to go-live with our new enterprise record solution, along with our full suite of CAD, mobile, field reporting and shield force applications, with a contracted go-live time line that represented a 33% improvement over traditional time lines. And our Data & Insights division is working in innovative ways to use our Socrata platform to respond to COVID-19 with data. Our Open Data platform was rapidly established as a one-stop shop for information and services for citizens in Buffalo, New York during the pandemic. Tyler also published on the Socrata platform, our nursing home COVID tracker, an embeddable dashboard displaying detailed national nursing home data on COVID-19 at the county and state levels. I couldn't be prouder of how our 5,500 dedicated professionals are supporting each other, delivering exceptional client service and displaying the spirit of innovation that has long been a hallmark of Tyler's success. We've already discussed the financial impact of COVID-19 on our second quarter, with significant reductions to both revenues and costs. I'd like to add some comments on our current outlook for the rest of 2020 as well as provide some thoughts on the long-term outlook and prospects for Tyler. We believe the revenue impact on the second quarter was approximately $35 million, and we expect that revenue growth for the rest of the year will continue to be significantly impacted. While we have not seen meaningful cancellations, we continue to see delays in procurement processes and longer sales cycles, as public sector entities continue to focus on issues relating to the pandemic and remote work, which will delay the timing of license and, to a lesser extent, subscription revenues. We have proven that we can deliver the majority of our professional services remotely, but we expect to see lower software and appraisal services revenues as some projects are delayed by client availability or travel restrictions. Billable travel was impacted significantly in the second quarter as most travel ceased, and we now expect to see very little travel in the second half of the year. In addition, a number of courts have closed or limited operations during the pandemic, which will continue to impact transaction-based e-filing revenues during this period. While our variable revenue streams will continue to be affected by the current environment, we anticipate that recurring revenues, which now comprise 75% of our total revenues, will continue to be generally unaffected. Our July 1 maintenance renewals went into place with normal pricing, and we do not expect to see any changes in client retention. Lower expenses have more than offset revenue reductions relative to our pre-COVID-19 plan, resulting in margin expansion. Many of these expense reductions, such as sales commissions and health claims, are short-term in nature, but we do expect that some savings will be sustainable. For example, I expect that post-COVID, we will continue to deliver a significant amount of services remotely, improving utilization of our professional services teams and reducing travel expense. I expect that more of our administrative and sales and marketing activities, including trade shows, will also be conducted virtually in the future, with a reduction in associated expenses. We also will continue to explore the possibility of greater numbers of employees working remotely, even after our offices are fully opened. On the product development front, we are continuing all of our strategic initiatives, including product R&D projects and accelerating our move to the cloud and still expect that R&D expense will grow at more than 11% for the year. We have not laid off any personnel and do not expect to do so. And in fact, we added 46 new heads during the second quarter, mostly in R&D. As we remain confident in our long-term outlook, there are uncertainties around the continuously evolving COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations and those of our clients. For example, government response to the pandemic continues to vary significantly from state to state and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state, thereby making the duration and scope of business restrictions within the public sector difficult to predict. Although the CARES Act provided approximately $424 billion in economic aid to state and local governments, an additional stimulus packages will likely provide more assistance, many of our clients face near-term budget pressures that could cause them to defer purchases. After suspending our guidance last quarter, we have reinstituted annual guidance for 2020 based on our high percentage of our recurring revenues and visibility in the pipeline for the second half, tempered by ongoing uncertainties around COVID-19. The midpoint of our non-GAAP revenue guidance implies growth of about 4% for the full year, along with operating margin expansion. As I said last quarter, I remain as confident as ever in Tyler's long-term outlook and prospects. Our company's fundamentals have never been stronger. And just as we did following the challenges of the dot-com bust, 9/11 and the Great Recession, we expect to emerge as a stronger company with an improved competitive position. The pandemic has not changed the underlying fundamentals and long-term demand for our software and services. Tyler exclusively serves the public sector and our clients will not go out of business. The solutions we provide are essential, whether managing revenue that keeps communities operating, ensuring public safety to help the most vulnerable or providing transparency and access to government for the residents of jurisdictions we serve. Our software manages mission-critical functions such as 911, courts, property taxes, utilities and payroll. Our clients generally acquire new solutions to replace aging systems that are at end of life and may be unreliable or unsupported, usually a high priority regardless of the economic environment. If anything, the current crisis is highlighting the unsustainable reliance on outdated technology by much of the public sector. Technology is an increasingly critical factor in helping government function effectively, especially in difficult times. Long-term opportunities will emerge from this crisis, as both Tyler and our clients reexamine historical business practices. For example, work-from-home postures further highlight the need and benefits of connectivity and cloud services, something we have been actively investing in and are continuing with our strategic collaboration with AWS. Clients will continue to appreciate the value of data and being connected with others, other departments and jurisdictions as well as with citizens. This is our connected communities' vision, a vision that only Tyler can execute. Our ability to deliver uninterrupted high-quality services and support during these difficult times only further strengthens our bonds with clients and reinforce Tyler's messages in both agility and stability. As I mentioned earlier, Tyler has endured challenging times in the past and emerged stronger than before. Today, we believe we are even better positioned to weather the economic slowdown. Recurring revenues made up 75% of our total this quarter. Our competitive position in win rates remains strong, and we have significantly expanded our total addressable market through investments in a combination of M&A and R&D. Our financial position today is also the strongest it's ever been, with 0 debt, approximately $530 million in cash and investments and substantial additional liquidity available through our $400 million undrawn credit facility. As a result, we're able to continue to invest at a high level in all of our long-term strategic initiatives, something that many of our competitors may not be able to do. Our ability to actively invest during the Great Recession was a key differentiator that strengthened our overall market position when demand inevitably returned. We will continue to do the same through this crisis. Finally, we achieved an important milestone last month when Tyler was added to the S&P 500. It's an honor to be listed among other innovative and highly regarded companies in the S&P 500 index. This recognition is the result of a lot of hard work by numerous employees over many years. Today, we have an incredibly talented team of 5,500 professionals with unmatched public sector experience and deep domain expertise. I'm proud to call them my colleagues, and I'm confident of our ability to together realize the opportunities ahead of us. Now we'll take questions, Danielle.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Peter Heckmann of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nPeter Heckmann: On customer budgets, can you talk a little bit more about, based on your analysis, who's being relatively more affected? Is it states, cities, counties? And how that's affecting some of their priorities for IT spending?\nLynn Moore: Yes, sure, Pete. It's a good question. And what we see is, as you know, about 80% of our business is at the local level city county, about 15% is at the state level and about 5% at the federal level. Going backwards from there, at the federal level, we're not really seeing any meaningful impact right now. We may see some delays, but those budgets seem to be intact. We are seeing some impact at the state level, when you look at our Tyler Federal division, which is really our MicroPact division. Their business is a mix -- pretty even mix between federal and state. And what we're seeing there is we're seeing some delays in RFPs. They're predominantly overwhelming at the state level, not the federal. At the city and county, it's still a little bit of a mixed bag. I think our clients are still grappling with the new budgets. I think they're still grappling with what type of stimulus funds may be available. And it's varying actually a little bit across our product suites. When you look at, for example, some of the leading indicators, RFPs and demos and execution of contracts. When you see things on our justice suite right now, our Courts & Justice solutions, our Public Safety solutions. Those are fairly on track right now for this year. We're expecting some pretty good sales. We've had -- obviously, we talked about Jacksonville, public safety. We expect some significant deals there. We're seeing a little bit more delays right now, I think, on the ERP side. But again, it's a little bit of a mixed bag right now.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. And that's helpful. And have you seen any indication that some of the smaller municipalities are looking at options of kind of banding together and jointly bidding out to vendors trying to get a volume discount across a number of smaller municipalities? Or is it still just you're basically negotiating with each municipality individually?\nLynn Moore: Yes. No, we're not really seeing small jurisdictions band together in that manner. So it's still kind of business as usual in that front.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore. Please go ahead.\nKirk Materne: Hi, thanks very much. Lynn, I want to follow up on a comment you made at the end. Obviously, you all are in a good position relative to 10 years ago and relative to a lot of your competition, both in terms of sort of just the breadth of your portfolio and your financial -- sort of your balance sheet right now. What are -- is there anything you can do in this kind of environment to help your clients out from a -- like is pricing something that you can help them out with to try to take share in this kind of environment? Are you all going to remain maybe more on the offensive around M&A if something kind of falls into your lap? I'm just trying to get a sense on, is this an opportunity for you all to take market share just given your position in the market? And if there's anything you can really do to accelerate that potentially?\nLynn Moore: Well, I think the investments we've been making across the board, particularly in cloud and modernizing our products, I think we're going to see that's becoming more and more important. We're not right now doing anything significantly with pricing. I think you're right. We are in a strong position. I would argue that today -- sitting here today, we're even in a much stronger position than we were three months ago at the last earnings call, even with our top-line revenues off a little bit. And our balance sheet is that much more stronger than it was three months ago or probably about another $200 million or so. We're three months further along in all of our R&D initiatives, including modernizing all our core apps and sort of, as I mentioned in our comments, we've learned a lot -- we're learning a lot of things about ourselves in how we do business. And so we know too when we emerge, we're going to be even more efficient. So I think those are all opportunities. Looking at M&A, as you remember, really last year, we had talked about -- we've done so many acquisitions in 2018 and wrapping into early 2019, we've sort of taken a bit of a deliberate pause. I'd say right now, we're back in the same mode that we've historically been. I've actually -- we've looked at a handful of deals over the last six, eight weeks, and I anticipate that we'll continue to look at deals. And I think those are some opportunities out there. We do have a balance sheet that we can use to our favor, to our competitive advantage, both internally with these investments, but also looking at potential M&A deals throughout the rest of the year and into next year.\nKirk Materne: Okay. And I realize visibility is challenging right now, but -- and not to get too nuanced on this, but is the challenge really just understanding what's at the top of the funnel? Or how things are progressing sort of through the funnel? Meaning, are the discussions out there still happening? It's just difficult to see how they're going to sort of translate from opportunities into bookings. I know it's sort of a little bit of a nuanced question, but I'm just kind of -- like the opportunity for you all seems to be pretty massive. I just want to make sure I understand whether or not -- is that -- are people not even talking anymore? Or is it more like, hey, we need to do this. It's just -- I don't know when I'm going to get the funding to actually buy your technology?\nLynn Moore: Yes. I'd say my answer is that it's mostly sort of as it's working through the funnel right now. I think I would sort of remind you back to the comments of last quarter. If you recall, before COVID hit, the market was really pretty robust. We were off to a really great start, which was a sign of what the entire pipeline was. And actually, we were on pace to beat our internal plan for Q1, which is usually a pretty good indicator of how we'll do for the rest of the year. That pipeline, it doesn't go away, as you know. I mean everything we do is essential, that demand is there. And so you got to kind of think back, okay, where was the market ahead of time? That market is going to stay. And then also in the interim, the normal pipeline is going to continue to grow, it's just going to be pushed out a little bit. And I do think our clients are still wrestling with that question a little bit. There is a little uncertainty, there's a little apprehension. Anecdotally, we're hearing some things from some of our salespeople. Clients are saying, we sort of still need to see what budgets are looking like. We feel pretty confident that Feds are going to provide some more stimulus funding, but it just hasn't happened yet. Even within climate -- within jurisdictions, there's funds there. Obviously, our maintenance and subscriptions are not being canceled. Those are still there. But the -- moving forward with new projects, there's a little politics going on as who's going to get what funds and when. And so just a little apprehension and uncertainty right now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt VanVliet of BTIG. Please go ahead.\nMatt VanVliet: Hello. Thanks guys. Good morning. Appreciate for taking the questions. I guess digging in a little bit more, you talked about ERP being a little bit slower, but some of the other areas that are maybe viewed as more critical, but need to have some sort of upgrade in technology like Courts & Justice. Maybe digging in a little bit more on some of the other areas, whether that's a little bit more on the civic planning side? Are you seeing any traction in municipalities wanting to get some of those revenue-generating capabilities back if construction can pick up and people are a little bit more back at work? And then also on the school systems, as they're all planning on what it might look like or taking a dual-track process in terms of what the fall might look like, are you having more conversations around potential to make purchases there?\nLynn Moore: Yes, Matt, it's a good question. And I would say right now that we're only a couple -- it's just a couple of months. And so I would take some of my comments as much anecdotal as anything. I don't know that there's anything that's established a firm trend right now. We're just seeing what deals we believe are going to continue to go forward and close, and we're certainly seeing that with some public safety and courts deals. As we saw back in the Great Recession, which I think we kind of lean on for a little bit of experience, we talked about how we're replacing end of life, we talked about how this is essential. And in some cases, it's okay, where exactly are they in an end of life, and can they squeeze 1 more year out of this financial system? Or can they squeeze 1 more year, two more years? And they may be in a position to sort of doing some of that. I think your comments are stud about our civic services and permitting, licensing and planning. A couple of the deals I mentioned in my comments were some of our larger deals in the quarter. And I think the pipeline and outlook there still looks pretty good. With respect to schools, that's certainly an area of some uncertainty right now in a lot of facets, right? I mean a lot of schools haven't even made up the decision as to how they're going to operate next year, whether or not they're going to bring kids back or not, which obviously creates ripple effects, not just in our business, but through all our kids' lives and our employees' lives and those around the country. So I'd say there's a little bit of uncertainty still there around schools. One of the things that we've done to your comment about civic services and recovery is our Data & Insights division is really working closely with our Munis ERP solution and with our EnerGov Civic Services solution. We're coming out with some products. They've come out this quarter. We've got a few clients who are piloting them right now. On the ERP side, we call them Executive Insights, and on the EnerGov side, civic services, we're calling them community development insights. And it's -- these are -- this is Data & Insights. It's our Socrata platform. It's built on top of Munis for the executive insights, providing real-time financial fiscal health metrics like budgets, cash balances, HR metrics, payroll revenue versus budget, certain areas, property revenues versus budget. And certainly on the community development insights, it's helping them sort of understand the economic health and recovery, what's going on? Is it's -- it's pulling up real-time data on permits issued, permit applications, inspections, the value of permit construction that's going on. So these, I think, are pretty valuable tools. They're -- like I said, we've got 4 early adopters right now, a lot of positive feedback. And I think once we sort of get those solidified, you're going to let us roll that out. And that's just an example of us leveraging some of the investments we made before in Data & Insights, where I think there's a big future here and applying it right now to specific needs of our clients.\nMatt VanVliet: Great. That's very helpful. And then following up on some of the free cash flow strength, in particular, around a lack of travel and maybe broader T&E-type of expenses and even commissions. But are you guys taking a look at what -- where you're at in terms of on plan or meeting quotas for salespeople? Are you looking to reset those at all to bring down those numbers to try to hit a certain percentage on quota? Should we expect maybe a little bit more of a payout in the back half if bookings can pick up a little bit? Just curious overall, kind of what the planning is around that to keep your salespeople happy, but understanding that maybe original numbers might not get hit?\nLynn Moore: Yes, it's a fair question. I think at a broad level, when you're looking at expenses and our operating margins for the rest of the year, I mean we kind of outlined that on our guidance, and we're expecting a lot of the things that are -- that we've seen over the last few months to continue on. We're evaluating. And we've done some things with our salespeople, and we'll continue to evaluate that. It's interesting. When we had this conversation three months ago, I think everybody, including us, thought the world would probably be in a little bit different place right now. And I think that's one reason we pulled down our guidance as there was so much uncertainty in around travel and things like that. And so as we're starting to see that this is going to continue on a little bit longer than probably even my expectation, certainly to the degree a few months ago, we're going to continue to look at that stuff internally.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Zukin of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nScott Wilson: Yes. Hi, Lynn. Hi, Brian. It's Scott Wilson on for Alex today. I guess, first question, just to level set the guide. Last quarter, the message was that you were confident in mid-single-digit growth. The reinstated guide is now at 4%, which is a little bit below where we were modeling. I guess with that in mind, you kind of hit on some of these things, but just to kind of be clear, what are the things that you're more confident in relative to 90 days ago? And what are the areas where you're less confident relative to 90 days ago?\nLynn Moore: Well, I'll start, and Brian, why don't you jump in? I think 90 days ago, we were generally under the assumption that local jurisdictions, I mean, just in general, your daily lives, but also what's going on with our clients that really, as we got into the third quarter, we'd start seeing a little bit more return to normal that people would be traveling, our ProServe's team would be on-site delivering services. Our appraisal services would be ramping up, that we would be starting to see more sales -- more in-person sales demos. And I think we just sort of -- I don't say we missed the boat, but it's -- things have continued to evolve. So I think that's an area that I think we sort of really didn't get a good feel for. I'm not sure three months ago; we had a really good feel for some of the operating expense savings that we would have throughout the rest of the year. It's certainly been a learning experience. One of the things we talk about as a management team constantly is something that successful companies do is they're constantly looking internally. They're constantly looking at ways to improve. Companies striving to do better. And what we've been able to do over the last few months is really take a hard look at some of our historical business practices, whether it's that on-site delivery of services, whether it's internal Tyler travel, whether it's the number of Trade Shows we do as well as the way we position some of our products we talked about Virtual Court. So this is a learning experience. It's a good one. And I think it's something that's going to help us emerge on the back end. Brian?\nBrian Miller: Yes. I think -- so I think if you look just at the change really from basically our soft guidance of mid- single-digit growth, the biggest change is to what we've actually implemented in the current guidance is around -- on the revenue side around billable travel that we did expect we'd see more of that come back as we got into the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. And now we've eliminated most of that from the plan for the remainder of the year. So the midpoint of our guidance now is 4% growth, and so it's still kind of in that mid-single digits. But that's the biggest downside. Now those revenues are basically no margin revenues. So the effect is positive on our margins. Probably the things we're more confident in as well would be somewhat around the pipeline for the second half of the year. Obviously, we're three months closer to that, the deals that in our plans are pretty far along in the pipeline. We have better visibility into and better information around that. And as Lynn mentioned, the expense savings, we -- now with a quarter -- a full quarter behind us in this environment, we have a better feel for where those savings are happening and the volume of those.\nScott Wilson: That makes sense. And then just a follow-up. When looking at kind of your SaaS ARR specifically this quarter, it actually looked pretty strong to me. I mean it was up 8% sequentially, 22% year-over-year, not that different than this time last year. So I guess with that in mind and contrasting your license revenues down 18%, were you a little surprised at the strength in the quarter? And then like with that in mind, is COVID potentially accelerating the shift to SaaS at a greater rate than even your strategy that kind of was focused on pricing and sales incentives to kind of incent that shift? Is that happening? Out of curiosity.\nBrian Miller: I do think that COVID is partially responsible for accelerating clients' desire to shift to the cloud and notwithstanding that we -- that our larger deals this quarter were mostly on the license side. But we did see some license deals and some SaaS deals, but more license deals slide out of the quarter, which resulted in that bigger decline in our license revenues. Yes, but the ARR growth this quarter on the revenue side, a lot of that represents deals we signed in prior quarters that are now coming online. For example, we've started recognizing revenues even in the North Carolina, e-warrants contract we signed last quarter. We're continuing to ramp up with the North Carolina court system and expand revenues there. So those prior bookings feed into the actual revenue recognition growth over time. And so we're benefiting from that. But we do think that this environment will continue to accelerate clients' desire to be in the cloud, which certainly, long-term, is a good thing and consistent with our desire to move more of our business to the cloud and where a lot of our investments are coming in today.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rob Oliver of Baird. Please go ahead.\nRob Oliver: Great. Thank you guys. Yes, a follow-up to that last question. Lynn, since you took over, you've been kind of moving, I think, your sales team more towards a cloud subscription focus, and that's bearing fruit. And I guess when you look back at previous downturns, customers were faced with a really expensive perpetual license renewal. And I'm just wondering, I know you said in your prepared remarks that subscription was also impacted this quarter, and that makes sense. But wondering to what extent as you guys work with your customers, you are leading more with that subscription side as it seems like it might be a much more palatable entry point for customers looking to do things with you guys? And then I have a follow-up.\nLynn Moore: Yes, I think that's right, Rob. I think as their budget pressures in public sector, people are going to be looking to do things that are more and more efficient and investing in large infrastructure and large IT shops, I think, is not going to be the way. It's going to go. And we have been moving more, I would call right now into what we call a cloud-preferred approach, historically, it was cloud agnostic. And so we're doing things with our salespeople. We're trying to get out that message of ROI, trying to get the message of security of the cloud. And I think you're starting to see that in our new sales. I think also what's interesting is, we talked about it -- I talked about a little bit in our prepared remarks, but is the SaaS flips that are going on within Tyler, those are continuing to gain traction. And I'd say, historically, if you look back a few years ago, most of the SaaS flips were really occurring on the ERP side. Really beginning last year, we started putting more internal focus, for example, in our Appraisal & Tax division on SaaS flip. We started to get the message out to our customers that the cloud is going to be the future. And that message is being well received. We're also starting to see it really in our Courts & Justice side. It's a focus of theirs this year. They've done some things, really looked at their pricing, as you know. They've got some very small clients up to some very large state-wide clients. And they've done some things with some tiered pricing and stuff, so they can start rolling that out. And it's showing in the numbers. I think we talked about 42 SaaS flips, but some of the more significant SaaS flips we had this year, you look at appraisal and tax, it was Franklin County, Ohio, it was Cab, Georgia. At C&J, it was Oasis County, Texas, which is Corpus Christi and Alameda County in California, which is our CaseloadPRO solution. So the focus, not only just on new sales, but also going back into our installed base with SaaS flips is something that's continuing to gain traction with us, and it's going to be a focus in the near future.\nRob Oliver: That's really helpful. And I just had one follow-up. Just on the New World Public Safety side, it's nice wins this quarter. And I know the win rates have continued to improve for you guys there. And it may be early to tell, I know it's sort of Q4-heavy, but anything that you guys are hearing from your customers relative to budgets. And I guess I'm particularly interested in what municipalities are thinking relative to their ability to spend amidst current protests and the environment that we're in, considering police funding and things like that?\nLynn Moore: Yes, sure. I think there's some really -- we've talked about a lot over the last several -- the last couple of years. I mean we've made a lot of investments in public safety that are really starting to pay off. Those investments were done to modernize the apps, but really to expand the TAM, and the Jacksonville contract is really a strategic win for them. As I mentioned, it's a full suite, including e-records, field reporting, SoftCode, Brazos, SceneDoc, Socrata. That win validates not only our investments we've been making in public safety and moving up market. But it also validates the acquisitions that we've been doing over the last several years. As I noted, is as I reel those off, SoftCode, Brazos, SceneDoc, Socrata, those are all recent acquisitions and things that we've done to enhance our offerings. And you're never quite sure what is the tipping point in the deal, but certainly, those helped round out a deal and help us move upstream. So those are continuing to pay off. As you look at budgets in public safety, as I mentioned earlier, that was a very large contract for us. We've got some significant opportunities that we think are still going to close this year. There's a lot of attention right now on defunding the police and what does that mean and what does it not mean? And that concept has kind of been around for a long time, probably going back to the civil rights days of the '60s. And I think it's not quite clear what that means for some. Is it -- are you talking about defunding? Are you talking about reforming? It's really talked about at some of the Tier 1 cities. But at the end of the day, public safety is going to be funded. Public safety is very important. I'm not sure that across the nation, despite what you see on television that there's some overwhelming push that there's going to be a defunding of police departments across the country. I think if anything, it probably puts a greater emphasis on technology, it puts a greater emphasis on some of the investments that we've been making, things like mobility and things -- I think a greater emphasis on data and insights and transparency and the things we're doing with Socrata integrating with our Public Safety solution. And so it's -- at the end of the day, I just -- I think that public safety is funding is going to be there. What we see in the near-term and the pipeline is there. And I think we're in a great position given all the investments we've been making in the last couple of years.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Berg of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nScott Berg: Hi, Lynn, congrats on a good quarter. A couple, I guess, quick ones for me. First of all, Brian, you had a nice expansion in operating margins, and you kind of highlighted the reasons for them, obviously, in the quarter, less travel, et cetera, less sales commissions. But operating margins have compressed a little bit over the last two to three years, mainly as you've invested more in product, you've obviously made a couple of acquisitions that had some lower-margin structures. But is this new level -- or the operating margins in the second quarter, is this kind of a sustainable level, do you think going forward with some of the changes you and Lynn highlighted to maybe service delivery, et cetera? Or you think that operating margins could maybe revert back to where they've been over the last 12 to 18 months as we come through this?\nBrian Miller: I think it's probably somewhere in between. Some of these things that are affecting our margins are fairly onetime or temporary situations. For example, our lower health claims costs around -- because people haven't been having elective procedures or going in for their physicals. That will come back. Some of the trade shows likely will come back. But in the long term, I think we're learning we can do virtual trade shows and learning some about the value of some of those things that we've done in the past and that some of them won't, company T&E. We just had very effective quarterly management meeting virtually, and we probably won't go back to having 4 of those in person afterwards. When you multiply those across the company, I think a lot of those will have permanent positive impacts on margins and efficiency, and there will be some of those that will come back. I think the biggest thing is probably around how we deliver services. And that's something we've talked about, pre-COVID, is doing that much more effectively. We have little to no margin on a lot of our professional services. We do them to control the quality of our engagements and have successful implementations that we can control, but don't make much money on that. And so this has certainly proven that we can do that effectively -- a large portion of that remotely. And that our clients who might have previously resisted that are willing to accept that. And so I think that will be one of the permanent changes. So I think there are some long-term margin improvements that will come out of this, and that's clearly a positive for us. So net, I do expect our margins will be better. But I think there's some reversion as some things come back. We do have -- and also, as we've said, we've really continued with our R&D. So a little bit of delays in hiring some people. But generally, we added quite a few R&D heads this quarter. And generally, we're going full steam ahead with our existing investment plans, and our R&D for the full year will be very close to what our plan was. So this margin expansion is even in the light of what was sort of our original plan for R&D.\nLynn Moore: Scott, if I could amplify on that, too. I agree with Brian about remote delivery of services, and it's something that clients are becoming more acceptant of that. It's not like next year or two years from now, we'll be 100% virtual delivery of services. That's just not -- that's probably not feasible. We'll do some things to help -- that is -- it's good to see clients accepting it. The fact that we're being successful with our go-lives is very important. We may do some pricing with either on-prem versus remote that will help. And then stepping back, I mean we talked earlier about it was a tough quarter for bookings because of last year. We're setting up a tough margin year for next year. And coming into the expectation, you're right, we have been investing heavily for a couple of years. And our expectation originally coming in the year was a little more flattish margins from the year before, and with margin pickup to start coming in 2021. So I would expect really going back to that baseline that we will have a pickup and perhaps a little bit more than we might have expected because of some of these sustainable savings, but still a little too early to tell exactly what that is.\nScott Berg: Great. Super helpful. And then a quick follow-up on, Lynn, your prior comments on customers that are moving towards your subscription solutions outside of your ERP customers, whether it's Public Safety, Courts & Justice, et cetera. Are those customers making the initial purchase decision still on a perpetual basis, and you're seeing more of those conversions to the cloud? Or are you actually seeing customers kind of net new upfront, selecting cloud from the get-go?\nLynn Moore: We're seeing net new. It's been in our Courts & Justice space. We've been seeing more in the cloud. We're seeing it more on the A&T side, same with EnerGov and things like that. But we're also -- really, the point of my comment was the focus was to outline our focus on internally on flips across a broader spectrum of our products. And so it's just part of our overall long-term initiative of moving to the cloud and say it's starting to get some traction.\nOperator: The next question comes from Charlie Strauzer of F -- I'm sorry -- CJS Securities. Please go ahead.\nCharlie Strauzer: Hi, good morning. Just, Brian, for you, it's probably best view is on the guidance for the year. Just some additional commentary on how to think about the split between Q3 and Q4, just to help us kind of models a little bit better?\nBrian Miller: Yes. And on the split, certainly, the timing has some uncertainty in it, as it always does. Bookings can be lumpy, particularly on the license side. We typically have a bigger license quarter in Q4 around public safety. So I'd expect that we would see sequential revenue growth in each of Q3 and Q4. And I mean I think the growth in each of those quarters is probably fairly consistent after -- so the number you need to get to, to get to that over -- the annual guidance number is probably pretty consistent between Q3 and Q4 in terms of a growth rate. And the earnings, we would expect to grow sequentially in Q3 and then again in Q4 as well. So sequential revenue growth, sequential earnings growth, but exactly where that split falls out is a little hard to tell. I mean I think the guidance implies something around 5% growth for the second half of the year. And that will likely be fairly consistent in both Q3 and Q4.\nCharlie Strauzer: Got it. That's helpful. And then just looking at the pipeline, you talked about a lot about the pipeline so far. But if you are seeing new RFPs coming to the pipeline, what areas are those coming in? And are you seeing some RFPs that are maybe leading to new product development ideas for your R&D team?\nLynn Moore: Well, there are still some new RFPs. But I would say that's just the volume is -- across is not as robust in certain areas as others, as I mentioned earlier. And this is really sort of looking out over the next 6, 9 months. And like I said in our -- mentioned earlier in my comments, we're seeing things at the Tyler federal level in the Justice solutions, those leading indicators, RFPs are holding fairly steady. Same with our Data & Insights solution. They're off a little bit right now in some of our ERP solutions. But again, to my comments before, it's -- this is all timing. These decisions don't go away. They just get delayed.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jonathan Ho of William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to start out with the virtual courts opportunity that you talked about. Can you give us maybe a sense of what that could look like? I know you're offering it for free in the beginning, but could this be an add-on module? Like can you talk a little bit about pricing or uplift as you kind of build out that capability?\nBrian Miller: Sure. It is -- once it gets out of the free trial basis, it is an add-on. It's a cloud offering, hosted at AWS. So it's a subscription add-on to the existing base. This is primarily -- today, with our municipal courts customers, which are less complex type courts, traffic courts and those sorts of things, many of them with smaller customers. So the individual uplift is sort of moderate, I'd say, compared to their existing recurring revenues with us. But it's certainly something we think is very broad applicability across our municipal court base. And also we're looking at expanding a similar offering into our larger Odyssey customer base. So I don't really -- I think, I'm not really in a position to quantify the opportunity, but it's -- I'd say it's a meaningful uplift from the existing recurring revenues with those customers.\nJonathan Ho: Got it. And then in terms of your ability to sell add-on capabilities and incremental offerings versus, I guess, the larger systems. I mean clearly, you're seeing delays in the bigger procurements. But is there an opportunity to maybe circle back to existing customers to upsell additional modules as you think about, I guess, pivoting in the current environment?\nLynn Moore: Yes, I think that's a good point, Jonathan. And the answer -- the short answer is yes. And we're actually seeing that. Our Insight sales across the board is holding fairly steady right now. And so I do think that's an opportunity, not just in this environment, but I actually think it's one of our larger opportunities as a company as we continue to move forward.\nOperator: The next question comes from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning guys. A question for you on the guidance. How important is the, I guess, the federal relief if it comes through? And what kind of impact would it have on your guidance if we do or do not get federal guidance for the rest of the year? I'm sorry, not federal guidance, but federal relief from the government.\nLynn Moore: Yes. I wouldn't expect it to have a meaningful impact for the rest of this year. And I think it will start having more of an impact as we get into 2021, and particularly as this budget cycle sort of -- we sort of run through this budget cycle. I mean it's one thing too for the Feds to go ahead and announce some significant stimulus. We've seen that already with some of the things they've done in response to COVID. It's another thing for the jurisdictions to get their applications in and get the funding and all of that stuff. So it's an important piece. I think it helps with some of their just general uncertainty right now and anxiety, but I wouldn't expect it to have a meaningful impact in 2020.\nBrian Miller: Yes, most deals that are going to close in the next 2 quarters are pretty far along in the pipeline that worked through lengthy sales processes already. And those generally are already funded in an existing budget and also generally are very high priorities in terms of the needs. So those, we expect to be largely unaffected to the extent we see delays around those. It's less around funding and more around just the logistics and the disruption that the clients are having that has slowed down some of the processes and might push them out of this quarter into next quarter and more of the short-term kinds of delays.\nKeith Housum: Got you. That's helpful. And then as I think about like almost your business like e-filings and appraisals, is there an opportunity here for pent-up demand? And once hopefully we get through the COVID issue by the end of the year or soon after, is there an opportunity for, I guess, more e-filing transactions to come through -- revenue to come through? Is that pent-up demand has worked through? Or is this pretty much more just delayed it kept -- keeps the can being kicked down the road further?\nLynn Moore: No, I think there's -- well, I don't know that we can say for certainty, but we believe that there will be an opportunity potentially for a bump in e-filing. E-filing is obviously challenged right now, even though some courts have opened, a significant percentage of current e-filings, current civil filings are really debt-related, they're landlord eviction-related. And right now, there's kind of -- there's moratoriums on that even where courts are open. Some of those cases, they won't go away. So we do think there's a possibility for pent-up demand, but I don't know that we've got real certainty around that right now.\nBrian Miller: And about 75% of our e-filing is on a fixed fee basis and 25% is transactional and variables. So it's a minority of our business on the e-filing side is affected today. But some of those places where the courts are shut down, we've seen that to be significant.\nOperator: At this time, there appears to be no more questions. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Moore for closing remarks.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Danielle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We certainly hope you all stay safe and healthy. And if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Please, you may now disconnect.",

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2020. In our earnings release, we've included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. This was the first time we've had a year-over-year decline in quarterly revenue since the fourth quarter of 2010, just before we emerge from the effects of the Great Recession, and ended the streak of 34 quarters of double-digit revenue growth. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $271.1 million, down 1.5%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $271.3 million, down 2.4%. Organic revenue growth was down 1.9% on a GAAP basis and 2.8% on a non-GAAP basis. Our core software and license -- software license and subscription revenues combined, grew 8.4% on a non-GAAP basis with 7.7% organic growth. Total revenues were about $35 million below our pre-COVID plan. Of that, approximately $11 million was attributed to delayed license and percentage of completion revenues; $8 million to professional services; $6.6 million to the cancellation of Connect; $4.5 million to billable travel; and $1.4 million to lower e-filing volumes. Subscription revenues for the quarter increased 16.6%. We added 125 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 42 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $39 million in total contract value. In Q2 of last year, we added 154 new subscription-based arrangements and had 27 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $128 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 43% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 80% in Q2 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.7 years compared to 6.1 years last year, when the average term was skewed by the 10-year $85 million contract with North Carolina. Revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, were relatively flat with Q2 of last year at $21.3 million. That amount includes e-filing revenues of $14.2 million, down 1.8% over last year and e-payments revenue of $7.1 million, up 5%. Lower volumes as a result of closed court operations in some jurisdictions reduced our transaction-based e-filing revenues by an estimated $1.4 million in the quarter. For the second quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $810 million, up 10.7%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q2 was approximately $258 million, up 21.7%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $85 million, up 0.3%, and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $467 million, up 7.4%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.54 billion, up 7.4%. As Lynn noted, our bookings declined by 31.6% to approximately $309 million against a very difficult comparison with Q2 of 2019. Last year's second quarter bookings were a record $452 million and included the largest contract in our history, the $85 million SaaS contract for the North Carolina courts as well as a $20 million SaaS contract with the Bexar County, Texas courts. Excluding those contracts from last year, the decline in bookings was 10.9%. However, for the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.2 billion, up 3%. Our software subscription bookings in the quarter added $9.2 million in new annual recurring revenue. As in the first quarter, cash flows were very robust during the second quarter. Cash flows from operations increased 62.5% to $39.8 million, and free cash flow more than tripled to $31.5 million. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was negative as a result of discrete tax benefits related to stock compensation and lower cash taxes contributed to the cash flow growth. We ended the quarter with $473 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Our guidance for the full-year of 2020 is as follows: we expect 2020 GAAP revenues will be between $1.124 billion and $1.144 billion, and non-GAAP revenues will be between $1.125 billion and $1.145 billion. We expect 2020 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.71 and $4.91 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2020 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.30 and $5.50. For the year, estimated pretax noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $79 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be between $90 million and $92 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 41.5 million and 42 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of negative 23% after discrete tax items, includes approximately $82 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. Our estimated non-GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2020 is 24%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be between $34 million and $35 million for the year, including approximately $10 million related to real estate and approximately $6 million of capitalized software development costs. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $81 million, including approximately $54 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Lynn for some additional comments. Yes. I think -- so I think if you look just at the change really from basically our soft guidance of mid- single-digit growth, the biggest change is to what we've actually implemented in the current guidance is around -- on the revenue side around billable travel that we did expect we'd see more of that come back as we got into the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. And now we've eliminated most of that from the plan for the remainder of the year. So the midpoint of our guidance now is 4% growth, and so it's still kind of in that mid-single digits. But that's the biggest downside. Now those revenues are basically no margin revenues. So the effect is positive on our margins. Probably the things we're more confident in as well would be somewhat around the pipeline for the second half of the year. Obviously, we're three months closer to that, the deals that in our plans are pretty far along in the pipeline. We have better visibility into and better information around that. And as Lynn mentioned, the expense savings, we -- now with a quarter -- a full quarter behind us in this environment, we have a better feel for where those savings are happening and the volume of those. I do think that COVID is partially responsible for accelerating clients' desire to shift to the cloud and notwithstanding that we -- that our larger deals this quarter were mostly on the license side. But we did see some license deals and some SaaS deals, but more license deals slide out of the quarter, which resulted in that bigger decline in our license revenues. Yes, but the ARR growth this quarter on the revenue side, a lot of that represents deals we signed in prior quarters that are now coming online. For example, we've started recognizing revenues even in the North Carolina, e-warrants contract we signed last quarter. We're continuing to ramp up with the North Carolina court system and expand revenues there. So those prior bookings feed into the actual revenue recognition growth over time. And so we're benefiting from that. But we do think that this environment will continue to accelerate clients' desire to be in the cloud, which certainly, long-term, is a good thing and consistent with our desire to move more of our business to the cloud and where a lot of our investments are coming in today. I think it's probably somewhere in between. Some of these things that are affecting our margins are fairly onetime or temporary situations. For example, our lower health claims costs around -- because people haven't been having elective procedures or going in for their physicals. That will come back. Some of the trade shows likely will come back. But in the long term, I think we're learning we can do virtual trade shows and learning some about the value of some of those things that we've done in the past and that some of them won't, company T&E. We just had very effective quarterly management meeting virtually, and we probably won't go back to having 4 of those in person afterwards. When you multiply those across the company, I think a lot of those will have permanent positive impacts on margins and efficiency, and there will be some of those that will come back. I think the biggest thing is probably around how we deliver services. And that's something we've talked about, pre-COVID, is doing that much more effectively. We have little to no margin on a lot of our professional services. We do them to control the quality of our engagements and have successful implementations that we can control, but don't make much money on that. And so this has certainly proven that we can do that effectively -- a large portion of that remotely. And that our clients who might have previously resisted that are willing to accept that. And so I think that will be one of the permanent changes. So I think there are some long-term margin improvements that will come out of this, and that's clearly a positive for us. So net, I do expect our margins will be better. But I think there's some reversion as some things come back. We do have -- and also, as we've said, we've really continued with our R&D. So a little bit of delays in hiring some people. But generally, we added quite a few R&D heads this quarter. And generally, we're going full steam ahead with our existing investment plans, and our R&D for the full year will be very close to what our plan was. So this margin expansion is even in the light of what was sort of our original plan for R&D. Yes. And on the split, certainly, the timing has some uncertainty in it, as it always does. Bookings can be lumpy, particularly on the license side. We typically have a bigger license quarter in Q4 around public safety. So I'd expect that we would see sequential revenue growth in each of Q3 and Q4. And I mean I think the growth in each of those quarters is probably fairly consistent after -- so the number you need to get to, to get to that over -- the annual guidance number is probably pretty consistent between Q3 and Q4 in terms of a growth rate. And the earnings, we would expect to grow sequentially in Q3 and then again in Q4 as well. So sequential revenue growth, sequential earnings growth, but exactly where that split falls out is a little hard to tell. I mean I think the guidance implies something around 5% growth for the second half of the year. And that will likely be fairly consistent in both Q3 and Q4. Sure. It is -- once it gets out of the free trial basis, it is an add-on. It's a cloud offering, hosted at AWS. So it's a subscription add-on to the existing base. This is primarily -- today, with our municipal courts customers, which are less complex type courts, traffic courts and those sorts of things, many of them with smaller customers. So the individual uplift is sort of moderate, I'd say, compared to their existing recurring revenues with us. But it's certainly something we think is very broad applicability across our municipal court base. And also we're looking at expanding a similar offering into our larger Odyssey customer base. So I don't really -- I think, I'm not really in a position to quantify the opportunity, but it's -- I'd say it's a meaningful uplift from the existing recurring revenues with those customers. Yes, most deals that are going to close in the next 2 quarters are pretty far along in the pipeline that worked through lengthy sales processes already. And those generally are already funded in an existing budget and also generally are very high priorities in terms of the needs. So those, we expect to be largely unaffected to the extent we see delays around those. It's less around funding and more around just the logistics and the disruption that the clients are having that has slowed down some of the processes and might push them out of this quarter into next quarter and more of the short-term kinds of delays. And about 75% of our e-filing is on a fixed fee basis and 25% is transactional and variables. So it's a minority of our business on the e-filing side is affected today. But some of those places where the courts are shut down, we've seen that to be significant."

            "name": "Lynn Moore",
            "content": "Thank you, Danielle, and welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings call. With me on the call today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, I'll have some preliminary comments, and Brian will review the details of our second quarter results. Then I'll have some additional comments, and we'll take questions. Thanks, Brian. We executed at a high level during the second quarter, as the effects of COVID-19 pandemic continued. From a financial perspective, GAAP revenues declined 1.5%, and non-GAAP revenues declined 2.4%. Revenues for the quarter were approximately $35 million below our pre-COVID plan. Many procurement processes encountered delays, as clients focused on addressing COVID-19, resulting in several contracts being pushed out of the quarter, reducing license and, to a lesser extent, subscription revenues. Also, services revenue was negatively impacted during the quarter as billable travel was essentially eliminated and fewer hours were delivered as we transition to providing most services remotely. As I noted on our last earnings call, due to concerns with COVID-19, our annual Connect user conference was canceled. And although a majority of the content was delivered virtually, we lost more than $6 million of revenue that would have been recognized in the second quarter. Recurring revenues remained strong. GAAP subscription revenues grew 16.6%, and non-GAAP subscription revenues grew 15.6%. Together, total recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions grew 12.3% on a GAAP basis and comprise approximately 75% of total revenues. On the positive side, operating expenses were also well below our original plan. We experienced significant savings in commissions, travel, marketing, health claims and other employee-related expenses. As a result, our operating margins expanded, with our non-GAAP operating margin up 290 basis points to 27.5%. Our cash flow was another high point in our results, with free cash flow up 226% over last year's second quarter. Bookings for the quarter were approximately $309 million, and as expected, declined 31.6% due to the very difficult comparison to the second quarter of 2019, which included 2 very large SaaS deals, 1 for the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts, and the other with Bayer County, Texas. Excluding these two contracts, bookings declined approximately 10.9%. Although we have not seen meaningful cancellations, we are seeing delays in procurement processes and lengthening sales cycles due to the effects of COVID-19, which impacted bookings this quarter. As we have discussed in the past, our new deal mix can be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, as was the case this quarter. The number of new software deals was weighted towards SaaS, with 66% of the total. However, the value of the new software deal is weighed towards on-premise license arrangements at 57%, as more of the larger deals that signed this quarter chose on-premises. Our largest deal in the quarter was a license arrangement with the state of West Virginia, valued at approximately $9 million for our iasWorld Appraisal solution, including appraisal services. Perhaps the most significant contract signed in the quarter was a public safety arrangement with Jacksonville, Florida, for our New World Public Safety records management and Brazos eCitation solutions, along with our Socrata Data & Insights, SceneDoc and SoftCode solutions, valued at approximately $5 million. Jacksonville, the 13th largest city in the nation, represents our largest public safety client to date. This one is important because it not only validates the significant investments we've made in the New World suite to position it to become competitive in Tier 1, but also showcases the strategic value of the acquisitions we've made in recent years. Other notable license deals during the quarter included an Odyssey court case management contracts, with the 10th Judicial Court in Johnson County, Kansas, which completes our state-wide presence in Kansas. Along with contracts for our MicroPact entellitrak solution, with the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission and the United States Department of Agriculture. In fact, three of our seven largest license deals in the quarter were for our MicroPact entellitrak solutions. We added two new counties in California for Odyssey, a licensed contract with Calusa County and a SaaS contract with Mariposa County. We've now won six of six California court deals that have been executed since the state-provided new funding for case management system replacements last year. Our largest SaaS deal in the quarter was a $3 million contract with Clay County, Florida for our EnerGov Civic services solution. We also signed a SaaS deal for EnerGov with the city of Sunnyvale, California, valued at approximately $1.3 million. Other significant SaaS arrangements signed this quarter were with the Bellevue School District in the state of Washington and the City of Lynn, Massachusetts for our Munis ERP solution, with the Abu Dhabi Global markets for our Modria Online Dispute Resolution solution with the Kansas Supreme Court for our CaseloadPRO solution, and with Clearmount County, Ohio for our Socrata Data & Insight solution. In addition, 42 existing on-premises clients signed contracts to move to the cloud, including Oasis County, Texas, with Odyssey Courts; Franklin County, Ohio and the Cab County, Georgia, with iasWorld Appraisal & Tax; and Alameda County in California with CaseloadPRO supervision. We also delivered the initial version of our e-warrant system to the state of North Carolina under the contract we signed late in Q1. We also have trial programs underway for e-warrants with 2 counties in Texas. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter. Thanks, Brian. I want to provide an update on how Tyler Technologies is approaching the challenge of COVID-19 and its effects on our business and our clients. First, our operational response. Tyler's 5,500 professionals continue to provide a high standard of client service with minimal disruption. Our primary focus continues to be on ensuring that our employees and their families are safe and healthy, while supporting clients who provide essential services to the public. Since mid-March, almost all of our staff have worked from home, with all but the most crucial travel eliminated. Our clients have faced disruption to their operations, as they deal with the effects of the pandemic on their communities and, in some places, civil unrest and focus on providing vital services to their citizens. Since March, we have seen delays in some procurement processes, although most late-stage processes are moving forward. Some implementation appraisal service projects have also encountered delays, as clients grapple with balancing social distancing orders with conducting daily operations. We've imposed travel restrictions on our employees, which has all but eliminated our ability to provide services on-site and to visit prospective clients for sales calls and demos. Virtually every trade show has been canceled, as was our Tyler Connect user conference scheduled for late April. We are addressing the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic by adapting the way we do business, including using web and video conferencing extensively for collaboration, conducting sales demos, providing client support and delivering professional services such as training remotely, and even executing complex go-lives virtually. With the spread of COVID-19, our clients' need for digital connectedness, both within their organizations and directly with the public, is rapidly shifting from a vision to an urgent requirement. In the last few months, we have seen numerous examples of our team members working to help our clients adapt to the current environment in truly amazing ways. I'd like to highlight a few examples. Following the cancellation of Connect, we offered much of the valuable content to all of our clients through a program called Still Connected, a series of live and recorded online sessions. We've delivered more than 320 sessions of content with 17,000 views of recorded webinars, enabling us to reach even more client personnel than would have attended Connect in person. We accelerated the launch of our new virtual court solution, which provides a turnkey platform built on AWS for conducting face-to-face court sessions with remote defendants over the web. We have offered it without charge for 90 days in order to help clients serve their constituents without interruption. 46 courts are now live, using the solution to handle cases remotely, while also broadening access to justice for disadvantaged or displaced defendants, and 18 additional courts are in the process of onboarding. And just yesterday, AWS recognized virtual court as the best remote work solution in the AWS 2020 public sector partner awards. Developers on our Versatrans team fast track development of a new bus attendants app that works with our school bus routing solutions to provide schools with a tool for limiting bus capacity and managing social distancing as well as facilitating contact tracing. Our Appraisal & Tax division worked with clients with active revaluation projects underway, including Delaware County, Pennsylvania and Franklin County, Ohio, to move to remote property valuation hearings. We've also pivoted from infield data collection work to using remote data to achieve equitable and repeatable property assessments that support vital property tax revenue streams for our clients. We successfully completed more than 180 go-lives across our product groups during the quarter, most with very few or no Tyler personnel on site. The port of Long Beach, California, the second busiest seaport in the U.S., became our third public safety client to go-live with our new enterprise record solution, along with our full suite of CAD, mobile, field reporting and shield force applications, with a contracted go-live time line that represented a 33% improvement over traditional time lines. And our Data & Insights division is working in innovative ways to use our Socrata platform to respond to COVID-19 with data. Our Open Data platform was rapidly established as a one-stop shop for information and services for citizens in Buffalo, New York during the pandemic. Tyler also published on the Socrata platform, our nursing home COVID tracker, an embeddable dashboard displaying detailed national nursing home data on COVID-19 at the county and state levels. I couldn't be prouder of how our 5,500 dedicated professionals are supporting each other, delivering exceptional client service and displaying the spirit of innovation that has long been a hallmark of Tyler's success. We've already discussed the financial impact of COVID-19 on our second quarter, with significant reductions to both revenues and costs. I'd like to add some comments on our current outlook for the rest of 2020 as well as provide some thoughts on the long-term outlook and prospects for Tyler. We believe the revenue impact on the second quarter was approximately $35 million, and we expect that revenue growth for the rest of the year will continue to be significantly impacted. While we have not seen meaningful cancellations, we continue to see delays in procurement processes and longer sales cycles, as public sector entities continue to focus on issues relating to the pandemic and remote work, which will delay the timing of license and, to a lesser extent, subscription revenues. We have proven that we can deliver the majority of our professional services remotely, but we expect to see lower software and appraisal services revenues as some projects are delayed by client availability or travel restrictions. Billable travel was impacted significantly in the second quarter as most travel ceased, and we now expect to see very little travel in the second half of the year. In addition, a number of courts have closed or limited operations during the pandemic, which will continue to impact transaction-based e-filing revenues during this period. While our variable revenue streams will continue to be affected by the current environment, we anticipate that recurring revenues, which now comprise 75% of our total revenues, will continue to be generally unaffected. Our July 1 maintenance renewals went into place with normal pricing, and we do not expect to see any changes in client retention. Lower expenses have more than offset revenue reductions relative to our pre-COVID-19 plan, resulting in margin expansion. Many of these expense reductions, such as sales commissions and health claims, are short-term in nature, but we do expect that some savings will be sustainable. For example, I expect that post-COVID, we will continue to deliver a significant amount of services remotely, improving utilization of our professional services teams and reducing travel expense. I expect that more of our administrative and sales and marketing activities, including trade shows, will also be conducted virtually in the future, with a reduction in associated expenses. We also will continue to explore the possibility of greater numbers of employees working remotely, even after our offices are fully opened. On the product development front, we are continuing all of our strategic initiatives, including product R&D projects and accelerating our move to the cloud and still expect that R&D expense will grow at more than 11% for the year. We have not laid off any personnel and do not expect to do so. And in fact, we added 46 new heads during the second quarter, mostly in R&D. As we remain confident in our long-term outlook, there are uncertainties around the continuously evolving COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations and those of our clients. For example, government response to the pandemic continues to vary significantly from state to state and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state, thereby making the duration and scope of business restrictions within the public sector difficult to predict. Although the CARES Act provided approximately $424 billion in economic aid to state and local governments, an additional stimulus packages will likely provide more assistance, many of our clients face near-term budget pressures that could cause them to defer purchases. After suspending our guidance last quarter, we have reinstituted annual guidance for 2020 based on our high percentage of our recurring revenues and visibility in the pipeline for the second half, tempered by ongoing uncertainties around COVID-19. The midpoint of our non-GAAP revenue guidance implies growth of about 4% for the full year, along with operating margin expansion. As I said last quarter, I remain as confident as ever in Tyler's long-term outlook and prospects. Our company's fundamentals have never been stronger. And just as we did following the challenges of the dot-com bust, 9/11 and the Great Recession, we expect to emerge as a stronger company with an improved competitive position. The pandemic has not changed the underlying fundamentals and long-term demand for our software and services. Tyler exclusively serves the public sector and our clients will not go out of business. The solutions we provide are essential, whether managing revenue that keeps communities operating, ensuring public safety to help the most vulnerable or providing transparency and access to government for the residents of jurisdictions we serve. Our software manages mission-critical functions such as 911, courts, property taxes, utilities and payroll. Our clients generally acquire new solutions to replace aging systems that are at end of life and may be unreliable or unsupported, usually a high priority regardless of the economic environment. If anything, the current crisis is highlighting the unsustainable reliance on outdated technology by much of the public sector. Technology is an increasingly critical factor in helping government function effectively, especially in difficult times. Long-term opportunities will emerge from this crisis, as both Tyler and our clients reexamine historical business practices. For example, work-from-home postures further highlight the need and benefits of connectivity and cloud services, something we have been actively investing in and are continuing with our strategic collaboration with AWS. Clients will continue to appreciate the value of data and being connected with others, other departments and jurisdictions as well as with citizens. This is our connected communities' vision, a vision that only Tyler can execute. Our ability to deliver uninterrupted high-quality services and support during these difficult times only further strengthens our bonds with clients and reinforce Tyler's messages in both agility and stability. As I mentioned earlier, Tyler has endured challenging times in the past and emerged stronger than before. Today, we believe we are even better positioned to weather the economic slowdown. Recurring revenues made up 75% of our total this quarter. Our competitive position in win rates remains strong, and we have significantly expanded our total addressable market through investments in a combination of M&A and R&D. Our financial position today is also the strongest it's ever been, with 0 debt, approximately $530 million in cash and investments and substantial additional liquidity available through our $400 million undrawn credit facility. As a result, we're able to continue to invest at a high level in all of our long-term strategic initiatives, something that many of our competitors may not be able to do. Our ability to actively invest during the Great Recession was a key differentiator that strengthened our overall market position when demand inevitably returned. We will continue to do the same through this crisis. Finally, we achieved an important milestone last month when Tyler was added to the S&P 500. It's an honor to be listed among other innovative and highly regarded companies in the S&P 500 index. This recognition is the result of a lot of hard work by numerous employees over many years. Today, we have an incredibly talented team of 5,500 professionals with unmatched public sector experience and deep domain expertise. I'm proud to call them my colleagues, and I'm confident of our ability to together realize the opportunities ahead of us. Now we'll take questions, Danielle. Yes, sure, Pete. It's a good question. And what we see is, as you know, about 80% of our business is at the local level city county, about 15% is at the state level and about 5% at the federal level. Going backwards from there, at the federal level, we're not really seeing any meaningful impact right now. We may see some delays, but those budgets seem to be intact. We are seeing some impact at the state level, when you look at our Tyler Federal division, which is really our MicroPact division. Their business is a mix -- pretty even mix between federal and state. And what we're seeing there is we're seeing some delays in RFPs. They're predominantly overwhelming at the state level, not the federal. At the city and county, it's still a little bit of a mixed bag. I think our clients are still grappling with the new budgets. I think they're still grappling with what type of stimulus funds may be available. And it's varying actually a little bit across our product suites. When you look at, for example, some of the leading indicators, RFPs and demos and execution of contracts. When you see things on our justice suite right now, our Courts & Justice solutions, our Public Safety solutions. Those are fairly on track right now for this year. We're expecting some pretty good sales. We've had -- obviously, we talked about Jacksonville, public safety. We expect some significant deals there. We're seeing a little bit more delays right now, I think, on the ERP side. But again, it's a little bit of a mixed bag right now. Yes. No, we're not really seeing small jurisdictions band together in that manner. So it's still kind of business as usual in that front. Well, I think the investments we've been making across the board, particularly in cloud and modernizing our products, I think we're going to see that's becoming more and more important. We're not right now doing anything significantly with pricing. I think you're right. We are in a strong position. I would argue that today -- sitting here today, we're even in a much stronger position than we were three months ago at the last earnings call, even with our top-line revenues off a little bit. And our balance sheet is that much more stronger than it was three months ago or probably about another $200 million or so. We're three months further along in all of our R&D initiatives, including modernizing all our core apps and sort of, as I mentioned in our comments, we've learned a lot -- we're learning a lot of things about ourselves in how we do business. And so we know too when we emerge, we're going to be even more efficient. So I think those are all opportunities. Looking at M&A, as you remember, really last year, we had talked about -- we've done so many acquisitions in 2018 and wrapping into early 2019, we've sort of taken a bit of a deliberate pause. I'd say right now, we're back in the same mode that we've historically been. I've actually -- we've looked at a handful of deals over the last six, eight weeks, and I anticipate that we'll continue to look at deals. And I think those are some opportunities out there. We do have a balance sheet that we can use to our favor, to our competitive advantage, both internally with these investments, but also looking at potential M&A deals throughout the rest of the year and into next year. Yes. I'd say my answer is that it's mostly sort of as it's working through the funnel right now. I think I would sort of remind you back to the comments of last quarter. If you recall, before COVID hit, the market was really pretty robust. We were off to a really great start, which was a sign of what the entire pipeline was. And actually, we were on pace to beat our internal plan for Q1, which is usually a pretty good indicator of how we'll do for the rest of the year. That pipeline, it doesn't go away, as you know. I mean everything we do is essential, that demand is there. And so you got to kind of think back, okay, where was the market ahead of time? That market is going to stay. And then also in the interim, the normal pipeline is going to continue to grow, it's just going to be pushed out a little bit. And I do think our clients are still wrestling with that question a little bit. There is a little uncertainty, there's a little apprehension. Anecdotally, we're hearing some things from some of our salespeople. Clients are saying, we sort of still need to see what budgets are looking like. We feel pretty confident that Feds are going to provide some more stimulus funding, but it just hasn't happened yet. Even within climate -- within jurisdictions, there's funds there. Obviously, our maintenance and subscriptions are not being canceled. Those are still there. But the -- moving forward with new projects, there's a little politics going on as who's going to get what funds and when. And so just a little apprehension and uncertainty right now. Yes, Matt, it's a good question. And I would say right now that we're only a couple -- it's just a couple of months. And so I would take some of my comments as much anecdotal as anything. I don't know that there's anything that's established a firm trend right now. We're just seeing what deals we believe are going to continue to go forward and close, and we're certainly seeing that with some public safety and courts deals. As we saw back in the Great Recession, which I think we kind of lean on for a little bit of experience, we talked about how we're replacing end of life, we talked about how this is essential. And in some cases, it's okay, where exactly are they in an end of life, and can they squeeze 1 more year out of this financial system? Or can they squeeze 1 more year, two more years? And they may be in a position to sort of doing some of that. I think your comments are stud about our civic services and permitting, licensing and planning. A couple of the deals I mentioned in my comments were some of our larger deals in the quarter. And I think the pipeline and outlook there still looks pretty good. With respect to schools, that's certainly an area of some uncertainty right now in a lot of facets, right? I mean a lot of schools haven't even made up the decision as to how they're going to operate next year, whether or not they're going to bring kids back or not, which obviously creates ripple effects, not just in our business, but through all our kids' lives and our employees' lives and those around the country. So I'd say there's a little bit of uncertainty still there around schools. One of the things that we've done to your comment about civic services and recovery is our Data & Insights division is really working closely with our Munis ERP solution and with our EnerGov Civic Services solution. We're coming out with some products. They've come out this quarter. We've got a few clients who are piloting them right now. On the ERP side, we call them Executive Insights, and on the EnerGov side, civic services, we're calling them community development insights. And it's -- these are -- this is Data & Insights. It's our Socrata platform. It's built on top of Munis for the executive insights, providing real-time financial fiscal health metrics like budgets, cash balances, HR metrics, payroll revenue versus budget, certain areas, property revenues versus budget. And certainly on the community development insights, it's helping them sort of understand the economic health and recovery, what's going on? Is it's -- it's pulling up real-time data on permits issued, permit applications, inspections, the value of permit construction that's going on. So these, I think, are pretty valuable tools. They're -- like I said, we've got 4 early adopters right now, a lot of positive feedback. And I think once we sort of get those solidified, you're going to let us roll that out. And that's just an example of us leveraging some of the investments we made before in Data & Insights, where I think there's a big future here and applying it right now to specific needs of our clients. Yes, it's a fair question. I think at a broad level, when you're looking at expenses and our operating margins for the rest of the year, I mean we kind of outlined that on our guidance, and we're expecting a lot of the things that are -- that we've seen over the last few months to continue on. We're evaluating. And we've done some things with our salespeople, and we'll continue to evaluate that. It's interesting. When we had this conversation three months ago, I think everybody, including us, thought the world would probably be in a little bit different place right now. And I think that's one reason we pulled down our guidance as there was so much uncertainty in around travel and things like that. And so as we're starting to see that this is going to continue on a little bit longer than probably even my expectation, certainly to the degree a few months ago, we're going to continue to look at that stuff internally. Well, I'll start, and Brian, why don't you jump in? I think 90 days ago, we were generally under the assumption that local jurisdictions, I mean, just in general, your daily lives, but also what's going on with our clients that really, as we got into the third quarter, we'd start seeing a little bit more return to normal that people would be traveling, our ProServe's team would be on-site delivering services. Our appraisal services would be ramping up, that we would be starting to see more sales -- more in-person sales demos. And I think we just sort of -- I don't say we missed the boat, but it's -- things have continued to evolve. So I think that's an area that I think we sort of really didn't get a good feel for. I'm not sure three months ago; we had a really good feel for some of the operating expense savings that we would have throughout the rest of the year. It's certainly been a learning experience. One of the things we talk about as a management team constantly is something that successful companies do is they're constantly looking internally. They're constantly looking at ways to improve. Companies striving to do better. And what we've been able to do over the last few months is really take a hard look at some of our historical business practices, whether it's that on-site delivery of services, whether it's internal Tyler travel, whether it's the number of Trade Shows we do as well as the way we position some of our products we talked about Virtual Court. So this is a learning experience. It's a good one. And I think it's something that's going to help us emerge on the back end. Brian? Yes, I think that's right, Rob. I think as their budget pressures in public sector, people are going to be looking to do things that are more and more efficient and investing in large infrastructure and large IT shops, I think, is not going to be the way. It's going to go. And we have been moving more, I would call right now into what we call a cloud-preferred approach, historically, it was cloud agnostic. And so we're doing things with our salespeople. We're trying to get out that message of ROI, trying to get the message of security of the cloud. And I think you're starting to see that in our new sales. I think also what's interesting is, we talked about it -- I talked about a little bit in our prepared remarks, but is the SaaS flips that are going on within Tyler, those are continuing to gain traction. And I'd say, historically, if you look back a few years ago, most of the SaaS flips were really occurring on the ERP side. Really beginning last year, we started putting more internal focus, for example, in our Appraisal & Tax division on SaaS flip. We started to get the message out to our customers that the cloud is going to be the future. And that message is being well received. We're also starting to see it really in our Courts & Justice side. It's a focus of theirs this year. They've done some things, really looked at their pricing, as you know. They've got some very small clients up to some very large state-wide clients. And they've done some things with some tiered pricing and stuff, so they can start rolling that out. And it's showing in the numbers. I think we talked about 42 SaaS flips, but some of the more significant SaaS flips we had this year, you look at appraisal and tax, it was Franklin County, Ohio, it was Cab, Georgia. At C&J, it was Oasis County, Texas, which is Corpus Christi and Alameda County in California, which is our CaseloadPRO solution. So the focus, not only just on new sales, but also going back into our installed base with SaaS flips is something that's continuing to gain traction with us, and it's going to be a focus in the near future. Yes, sure. I think there's some really -- we've talked about a lot over the last several -- the last couple of years. I mean we've made a lot of investments in public safety that are really starting to pay off. Those investments were done to modernize the apps, but really to expand the TAM, and the Jacksonville contract is really a strategic win for them. As I mentioned, it's a full suite, including e-records, field reporting, SoftCode, Brazos, SceneDoc, Socrata. That win validates not only our investments we've been making in public safety and moving up market. But it also validates the acquisitions that we've been doing over the last several years. As I noted, is as I reel those off, SoftCode, Brazos, SceneDoc, Socrata, those are all recent acquisitions and things that we've done to enhance our offerings. And you're never quite sure what is the tipping point in the deal, but certainly, those helped round out a deal and help us move upstream. So those are continuing to pay off. As you look at budgets in public safety, as I mentioned earlier, that was a very large contract for us. We've got some significant opportunities that we think are still going to close this year. There's a lot of attention right now on defunding the police and what does that mean and what does it not mean? And that concept has kind of been around for a long time, probably going back to the civil rights days of the '60s. And I think it's not quite clear what that means for some. Is it -- are you talking about defunding? Are you talking about reforming? It's really talked about at some of the Tier 1 cities. But at the end of the day, public safety is going to be funded. Public safety is very important. I'm not sure that across the nation, despite what you see on television that there's some overwhelming push that there's going to be a defunding of police departments across the country. I think if anything, it probably puts a greater emphasis on technology, it puts a greater emphasis on some of the investments that we've been making, things like mobility and things -- I think a greater emphasis on data and insights and transparency and the things we're doing with Socrata integrating with our Public Safety solution. And so it's -- at the end of the day, I just -- I think that public safety is funding is going to be there. What we see in the near-term and the pipeline is there. And I think we're in a great position given all the investments we've been making in the last couple of years. Scott, if I could amplify on that, too. I agree with Brian about remote delivery of services, and it's something that clients are becoming more acceptant of that. It's not like next year or two years from now, we'll be 100% virtual delivery of services. That's just not -- that's probably not feasible. We'll do some things to help -- that is -- it's good to see clients accepting it. The fact that we're being successful with our go-lives is very important. We may do some pricing with either on-prem versus remote that will help. And then stepping back, I mean we talked earlier about it was a tough quarter for bookings because of last year. We're setting up a tough margin year for next year. And coming into the expectation, you're right, we have been investing heavily for a couple of years. And our expectation originally coming in the year was a little more flattish margins from the year before, and with margin pickup to start coming in 2021. So I would expect really going back to that baseline that we will have a pickup and perhaps a little bit more than we might have expected because of some of these sustainable savings, but still a little too early to tell exactly what that is. We're seeing net new. It's been in our Courts & Justice space. We've been seeing more in the cloud. We're seeing it more on the A&T side, same with EnerGov and things like that. But we're also -- really, the point of my comment was the focus was to outline our focus on internally on flips across a broader spectrum of our products. And so it's just part of our overall long-term initiative of moving to the cloud and say it's starting to get some traction. Well, there are still some new RFPs. But I would say that's just the volume is -- across is not as robust in certain areas as others, as I mentioned earlier. And this is really sort of looking out over the next 6, 9 months. And like I said in our -- mentioned earlier in my comments, we're seeing things at the Tyler federal level in the Justice solutions, those leading indicators, RFPs are holding fairly steady. Same with our Data & Insights solution. They're off a little bit right now in some of our ERP solutions. But again, to my comments before, it's -- this is all timing. These decisions don't go away. They just get delayed. Yes, I think that's a good point, Jonathan. And the answer -- the short answer is yes. And we're actually seeing that. Our Insight sales across the board is holding fairly steady right now. And so I do think that's an opportunity, not just in this environment, but I actually think it's one of our larger opportunities as a company as we continue to move forward. Yes. I wouldn't expect it to have a meaningful impact for the rest of this year. And I think it will start having more of an impact as we get into 2021, and particularly as this budget cycle sort of -- we sort of run through this budget cycle. I mean it's one thing too for the Feds to go ahead and announce some significant stimulus. We've seen that already with some of the things they've done in response to COVID. It's another thing for the jurisdictions to get their applications in and get the funding and all of that stuff. So it's an important piece. I think it helps with some of their just general uncertainty right now and anxiety, but I wouldn't expect it to have a meaningful impact in 2020. No, I think there's -- well, I don't know that we can say for certainty, but we believe that there will be an opportunity potentially for a bump in e-filing. E-filing is obviously challenged right now, even though some courts have opened, a significant percentage of current e-filings, current civil filings are really debt-related, they're landlord eviction-related. And right now, there's kind of -- there's moratoriums on that even where courts are open. Some of those cases, they won't go away. So we do think there's a possibility for pent-up demand, but I don't know that we've got real certainty around that right now. Thanks, Danielle, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We certainly hope you all stay safe and healthy. And if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks."

Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. We got a very solid first quarter with a great deal of momentum going into the second half of March, when we began to see the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The market was active and we executed at a high level. This was our 34 consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. As GAAP revenues grew 11.9% and non-GAAP revenues grew 11.3%. Organic revenue growth was 6.4% for GAAP revenues, and 5.7% for non-GAAP revenues. Our core software revenues from licenses and subscriptions grew 12.1% on a non-GAAP basis, with 8.3% organic growth. We continue to experience an increasing preference among clients for cloud offerings, as subscription arrangements represented 73% of new contract value signed this quarter. Of course, this was pressure on short-term revenue growth, but generates higher revenues and margins over the long-term. GAAP subscription revenues grew 21.5% and non-GAAP subscription revenues grew 20.5%. Subscription revenue growth has now exceeded 20% for 11 consecutive quarters and 52 of the last 57 quarters. Total recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions grew 17.1% on a GAAP basis, and comprised approximately 71% of total revenues. It was another extremely strong quarter for bookings, which were up 39.8%, our second consecutive quarter of greater than 30% bookings growth. Our two largest SaaS deals in the quarter led the way, both we're following contracts with the state of North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts. The first was for our new Odyssey e-warrant solution and was valued at approximately $24 million. The second contract, which we noted on our last earnings call, was for our Brazos e-citation solution, valued at approximately $14.5 million. Both of these 10 year SaaS agreements expand on the relationship with North Carolina that started with our largest SaaS agreement ever, an $85 million contract signed last June for Odyssey case management in e-filling solutions. And demonstrate our ability to grow our client relationships across our broad portfolio of integrated solutions. We signed two other SaaS deals in the quarter that each had a contract value of greater than $6 million. One with DuPage County, Illinois, for our IS World Appraisal solution, and one with the city of Richardson, Texas, where multi suite arrangement for our Munis ERP, ExecuTime, time and attendance and EnerGov Civic Services, Incode Courts and Socrata Data Insights Solutions takes full advantage of our connected communities vision. We also signed five new SaaS arrangements with contract values greater than $3 million. Four of those deals, were for our Munis ERP solution with the cities of Merced, Napa and Palm Springs, all in California, as well as Napa County, California. The fifth was with the South Carolina Department of Education for the first statewide implementation of our Versatrans school transportation solution. Our largest on-premises license deal of the quarter was a $6.3 million contract with Beaver County, Pennsylvania for our IS World Appraisal solution, which also included appraisal services. We continue to widen our market share lead in the California Court Case Management market with a $4.4 million on-premises license contract with Contra Costa County for Odyssey Solution. We also signed a $2.7 million license arrangement with L.A. County for EnerGov Civic Services solution. Now I'd like to Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter, and then we'll move to discussion of COVID-19.\nBrian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2020. In our earnings release, we've included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results in comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the investor relations section of our website under the financial reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the first quarter were $276.5 million, up 11.9%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $276.8 million, up 11.3%. Organic revenue growth was 6.4% on a GAAP basis and 5.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Our core software license and subscription revenues combined grew organically 8.3% on non-GAAP basis. Subscription revenues for the quarter increased 21.5%. We added 131 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 19 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $101 million in total contract value. In Q1 of last year, we added 128 new subscription-based arrangements and had 13 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $49 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprise approximately 73% of new -- total new software contracts value signed this quarter compared to 54% in Q1 last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 5.9 years, compared to 4.1 years in Q1 last year, with the increase caused by the two large 10 year contracts with the state of North Carolina mentioned earlier. Revenues from e-filing and online payments which are included in subscriptions increased 14.7% to $22 million. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $14.9 million up to 1.7% over last year, and e-payments revenue of $7.1 million up 56.7%. For the first quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue or ARR was $785 million up 16.2%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q1 was approximately $239 million, up 22.8%, transaction based ARR was approximately $88 million up 14.7% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $458 million up 13.3%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.5 billion up 19.2%, backlog included $369 million of maintenance compared to $353 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $668 million compared to $489 million last year, and includes approximately $128 million related to fixed fee e-filing contracts. Including our e-filing contract with the state of Texas, which was extended for one year through August of 2022 during the quarter.  As Lynn noted, our bookings were very strong again this quarter at approximately $319 million, an increase of 39.8% from Q1 of last year. But the trailing 12 months bookings were approximately $1.4 billion, up 37%.  Our software subscription bookings in the quarter added $12.6 million in new annual recurring revenue up 10.7% over last year's $11.4 million. For comparison it's all of our new subscription contracts have been under licensed arrangements, we estimated that they would have represented additional license revenue of approximate $20 million. As a reminder, our bookings comparison in the second quarter will be a very tough one, irrespective of the impact of COVID-19. Last year's second quarter bookings were record $452 million an included our largest contract in history, the $85 million SaaS contract for the North Carolina Courts, as well as the $20 million SaaS contract with Bear County, Texas Courts. Cash flow from operations more than doubled to $56.7 million and free cash flow quadrupled to $46 million, primarily due to strong collection of receivables. During the quarter, we repurchase 58,804 shares of our stock for a total of $15.5 million, or an average of approximately $263 per share. We ended the quarter with $393 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn for the discussion on the impact of and our responses to the COVID-19 pandemics. Lynn?\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and its effect on the economy, I want to share information on how Tyler Technologies approaching this challenge and its impact on our business. First, our operational response. Tyler's nearly 5500 team members continue to provide a high standard of client service with mi nimal disruption. Our primary focus has been on ensuring that our employees and their families are safe and healthy, while supporting clients who provide essential services to the public. Most of our offices already had many staff members who normal workdays involve remote work environments. Beginning in mid-March, we transition quickly to work from home for all of our staff. Equipping our employees to continue their work uninterrupted and also curtail travel for our employees. Our clients face increasing disruption to their operations, as they dealt with the effects of the pandemic on their communities, and focused on providing vital services to their citizens. In March, we began seeing delays in some procurement processes, and finalizing some existing contract awards became logistically more difficult. Some implementation appraisal service projects were also delayed, as clients were grappling with balancing local shelter in place and social distance orders while conducting daily operations. Trade shows where large numbers of vendors and prospective clients gather in person were scheduled or rescheduled or canceled. We are addressing the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic by adapting the way we do business, using web and video conferencing extensively for collaboration, conducting sales demos, providing client support and delivering professional services such as training remotely, and even executing complex go lives virtually. With the spread of COVID-19, our clients need for digital connectedness both within the organization and directly with the public is rapidly shifting from a vision to an urgent requirement. In recent weeks, we've seen many examples of our team members working with our clients to adapt to the current environment in truly inspiring ways. I'd like to highlight a few examples. San Bernardino County, California, pulled off a completely virtual go-live of our Odyssey court case management system by pivoting to our remote command center model. The go-live would ordinarily have involved a number of Tyler team members travelling to be on site. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated the launch of our new virtual core solution and we are offering it without charge for 90 days, in order to help court client serve their constituents without interruption. Since the official launch last month, more than 16 courts have selected this solution to handle cases remotely, removing the burden of having defendants physically appear in a courtroom, while also broadening access to justice for disadvantaged or displaced defendants. The New York State Division of Veterans Affairs deployed our Entellitrak solution in under a week. So it\u2019s staff to continue to approve claims remotely, ensuring that veterans in the state will continue to have access to benefits. Numerous law enforcement agencies optimize their new world computer aided dispatch tools to flag calls for service or someone might be a COVID-19 carrier, allowing officers to take necessary precautions. School districts are using Tyler Traversa Ride 360 app temporarily offered free of charge to assist with parent communications during the crisis, and are using our school bus routing software to plan meal deliveries to families in need. The Superior Court of San Luis Obispo California worked with Tyler teams over a single weekend to customize its Odyssey guide and file solution. So domestic violence complaints to be filed online while shelter in place orders are in effect. Numerous cities are using our MyCivic app to provide up to the date COVID-19 information to residents. I couldn't be prouder of how our dedicated professionals have embraced the challenge and are selling it meeting the needs of our clients. I'm constantly inspired by the spirit, resilience and compassion shown by our team members. With that backdrop, I'd like to make a few general comments about the financial impact of the pandemic on the quarter and the rest of 2020. As well as provide some thoughts on the long-term outlook and prospects for Tyler. Well, not material, the pandemic and response by clients and prospects did affect first quarter results. As I mentioned previously, a few sales pushed out in the first quarter, and professional services revenues, including global travel were also negatively impacted. We also canceled our annual user conference, Tyler Connect, which was scheduled to be held this week in Orlando. The costs associated with that cancellation, approximately $727,000 are included in our first quarter results. We estimate that the total revenue impact of COVID-19 in the first quarter was approximately $6 million. As we look out over the rest of 2020, we anticipate a greater impact from COVID-19 in the second and third quarters. While we have not seen meaningful cancellations, we continue to see delays in procurement processes and lengthening sales cycles, as public sector entities focus on issues related to pandemic. Although the Cares Act provided approximately 424 billion in economic aid to state and local governments, and additional stimulus packages are expected to provide more assistance. Many of our clients will face near term budget pressures. We can deliver the majority of our professional services remotely, but we expect to see lower services revenues as some projects are delayed by client availability. In addition, a number of courts have limited operations during the pandemic, which will impact transaction based e-filing revenues during this period.  In addition to these core revenues, approximately $6 million of revenues classified as hardware and other revenues will be eliminated in the second quarter as a result of the cancellation of our Connect conference. Billable travel will also be impacted significantly in the second quarter, but should return a safe begin to transition back from shelter in place to more normal operations.  While some of these variable revenue streams will continue to be impacted by the current environment, we anticipate that recurring revenues, which comprise approximately 70% of our total revenues will not be significantly affected. We expect to continue to invest in product development and accelerating our move to the cloud at levels consistent with our initial plans for the year.  We value the experience and expertise of our employees and do not expect to eliminate any positions, but anticipate the incremental hiring will be reduced somewhat from our original plans. We also expect to see reductions in some expenses, including travel and entertainment, trade shows and health claims.  As we remain confident in our long-term outlook, there are significant short-term uncertainties around the continuously evolving COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations and those of our clients. For example, government response to the pandemic will continue to vary significantly from state-to-state, and even from jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction within a state, thereby making the duration and scope of business restrictions within the public sector difficult to predict.  As a result, we are suspending our guidance until such time as we have more clarity around the ultimate severity, duration and impact of the pandemic. I expect to have more clarity on the impact of COVID-19 to our 2020 financial performance during our second quarter earnings call.  While our near-term outlook remains clouded by some uncertainty, given our high percentage of recurring revenues, it's my current expectation that Tyler revenues will still grow in the mid single-digits during 2020 with relatively flat operating margins compared to last year.  As I look out beyond the uncertainties created by the pandemic, I am as confident as ever in Tyler's long-term outlook and prospects. Tyler's fundamentals have never been stronger. Tyler has endured trying times in the past, including Y2K and the dot-com bust, 911 in the great recession. Each time, we emerged as a stronger company with an improved competitive position.  Unlike certain industries, the pandemic has not changed the underlying fundamentals and long-term demand for our software and services. Tyler exclusively serves the public sector, including local, state and federal government. Our clients will not go out of business, and the solutions we provide are essential, whether managing revenue to keep communities operating, ensuring public safety to help the most vulnerable, or providing transparency and access to government for the residents of the jurisdictions they serve.  Our software manages mission critical functions, such as 911, dispatch, courts, property taxes, utilities and payroll. Often our clients are acquiring solutions to replace aging systems that are end of life and may be unreliable or unsupported. Replacing those essential services is generally a high priority, regardless of the economic environment.  If anything, the current crisis is already highlighting the reliance on outdated technology by large segments of the public sector. You likely have seen recent news around issues related some of these decades-old COBOL based systems.  Long-term opportunities will emerge from this crisis as both Tyler and our clients we examine historical business practices. For example, work from home postures further highlight the need and benefits of connectivity and cloud services, something we've been actively investing in and are continuing with our strategic collaboration with AWS. Clients will continue to appreciate the value of data and being connected with others, with other departments and jurisdictions as well as its citizens. This is our connected communities vision, a vision that only Tyler can execute. Clients may become more willing to accept remote delivery of services, something they've been more reluctant to do in the past. Doing so makes our employees even more productive and efficient. And our ability to deliver uninterrupted, high quality support during these uncertaintimes, only further strengthens our bonds with clients and reinforces Tyler's messages of both agility and stability. As I mentioned earlier, Tyler has endured challenging times in the past and emerged stronger than before. Today, we believe, we are even better positioned to whether an economic slowdown. Recurring revenues comprise approximately 70% of our total, including newer transaction based revenue streams, like e-filing online payments. Our competitive position and win rates are stronger than ever. And we've significantly expanded our total addressable market through investments in a combination of M&A and Research and Development. And technology is increasingly critical factor in helping government function effectively, especially in difficult times. Our financial position is also the strongest it's ever been, with zero debt, nearly $400 million in cash and investments and substantial additional liquidity available through our $400 million undrawn credit facility, which can be further expanded through an accordion feature. As a result, we're able to continue to invest at a high level in all of our long-term strategic initiatives, something that companies with highly leveraged balance sheets or start-ups lacking the stability of highly recurring revenue base may not be able to do. Our ability to actively invest during the great recession was one of the key differentiators that strengthen our overall market position, when demand inevitably returned. We will continue to do the same during this crisis. We recognize this as an evolving situation. Tyler is fortunate to have a deep and broad base of knowledge and domain expertise across our employee group, which is approaching the situation with compassion and good humour. I am confident, we will see our way through these unusual circumstances with a spirit of cooperation, integrity and service that has been the hallmark of our company from the beginning. I can't be more proud and excited to be part of Tyler than I am now. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to John for his comments.\nJohn Marr: Thanks, Lynn and Brian. Obviously, a little different call and unusual and a lot of information to digest. Before we take your questions, I'd like to reinforce a few of the highlights. First, I want to add my recognition and appreciation to the entire Tyler team, as well to the strong leadership that Lynn and his executive team have provided. We deliver and support a lot of great technology. But the true value of Tyler exists in our 5500 incredible employees. These professionals are what differentiate Tyler from all other players in this space. Lynn and Brian provided a lot of data points in detail. I'll just add one of my own anecdotal observations. Nearly every day for the past month, and we drive through the parking lots of the two larger facilities here in Maine, where normally there would be 500 or 600 cars. I need to admit after seeing this company grow to this level over the past 20 years, it can be a little discouraging to see nearly completely empty parking lots. But then as I talk to our leadership team, I'm told that the dev and R&D projects are on schedule. Customer support issues are being handled and close was better than the normal response times. And go live continue to move forward. As Lynn has been saying it's not only impressive, it's inspiring. From early in the morning until literally midnight or past there, thousands of Tyler employees are tunneled into the network and cranking out the work. These people have lives, children, homeschooling, spouses working, some of them in the healthcare professions in their own commitments. One interesting fact is that the highest network activity is late at night. 8, 10, 12 o'clock. Literally hundreds, sometimes thousands are online getting the work done after the other challenges of the day have been satisfied.  It's incredible to witness, it's also gratifying to know that we have a business model strategy and we're in a position where these jobs are secure, and Tyler will only grow stronger. Yes, we will be impacted in the short and likely medium term. As you've heard, sales cycles will lengthen our ability to travel the customer sites will have an impact, and there will be some incremental pressure on government budgets at all levels. But the fundamentals that we are built on aren't changing. Everything we do is centered around essential enterprise applications. Our customers will survive and we're aligning technology even more to recover. They're still going to run payrolls, manage courts, dispatch first responders, appraise properties, and on and on. But now, there is some uncertainty. The Tyler will grow this year will be profitable, will strengthen our already strong balance sheet, and most importantly, will execute on all the key strategic and competitive initiatives. This simply won't be true for most of our competitors. Smaller startup types don't have the financial strength. Many of our competitors are peeking around and saddled with significant debt, limiting their investment flexibility. Other horizontal players, this isn't a first or highest priority, and they'll have to make difficult decisions. I'm not suggesting there won't be other good competitors on the other side of this thing. There always will be, but I'm certain that Tyler will be stronger on the other side. Whatever negative impact may occur over the next couple of quarters, it's just timing. If a decision or replacing system is delayed, that's all it is delayed. We saw this in the great recession with a slow year, year and a half and then a very robust recovery. It's a net zero game and when those deals come back online, I'm confident our win rates will only be higher.  Now Brent, we'll take questions\nOperator: We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Kirk Materne with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nKirk Materne: I guess maybe for Lynn or John. And John, you sort of refer to the great recession, I was kind of curious. Obviously your customer base is fairly unique, and correct me if I'm wrong, but I think a lot of the budget in process maybe happens over the course of this summer as new fiscal year budgets are set. So \u2013 when you think you have a little bit more maybe insight as to how project planning might get impacted by the uncertainty brought on by COVID. Is this something you might have a little bit more visibility on by the end of the summer, as budgets are set? Or is this something that it's frankly, just a totally open ended question mark at this point.\nJohn Marr: It hard to know, Kirk. Some of the budget here are actually different around the country. Some people go out, do their due diligence, go through a selection process and then go to finance committees for funds, others get the money appropriated and know they have it and then execute the process. So it'll be a little bit all over the place. That's obviously why we suspend guidance. As we've said, 70% of our business is recurring, we don't see it to be affected in a meaningful way. A lot of the other 30 comes out of backlog and is pretty essential there has to occur. And so you end up with a small piece of our business that's important to us. But it's a little less predictable at this point in time, and we'll just kind of have to see how things unfold. As I've said, and what we experienced in the great recession was the deals that got pushed, they all occurred. Back then, we actually had a flat revenue year and we've negative $1 million, the only time it's ever happened. And then we had several very strong years following that. So it's really just a shift in the timing. If they need new systems, they simply need them and they will replace them. But I think the next few quarters will be hard to see, other than the practice in our case, they are on a small percentage of our business, that's a risk and the vast majority of it stays in place.\nKirk Materne: Yes, that'll make sense. And maybe just in terms of early still, early on is so fluid that just maybe in terms of your conversations with customers right now, in terms of maybe their propensity to think more about sort of subscription models in terms of, maybe some of the CapEx savings versus OpEx, I guess there's the state local governments sort of thinking that same way that a lot of the commercial companies who in terms of CapEx savings versus OpEx stand, and does that help or bring about I guess, maybe even faster transition towards subscription are always, I just curious how you guys think that's going to be?\nJohn Marr: I think the bigger driver from this incident is just the availability of technology. So with everybody working from home, with the citizen and partner facing apps, applications, much of that's just much more reliable in the cloud. So, some of these people on legacy systems that are hosted in city halls, county offices, courthouses, it's been much more difficult for them to provide that kind of access in a reliable fashion in partnering with somebody that runs a modern technology, advanced cloud system, gives them far greater flexibility. So I think that will be the bigger driver to accelerate the movement of cloud.\nKirk Materne: Okay. Great. I'll turn it over to others. Thanks for your time. And stay safe.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Scott Berg with Needham. Please go ahead.\nScott Berg: Hi, John, Lynn and thanks for taking questions. I guess first question was you talked about some of the similar fees in 2008 John, you just mentioned that expectation that deals back I mean, related component. But what the state about today versus 2008? You gave the guidance, and some uncertainties through the different commentaries interesting that due to the visibility of the business is a little bit different than 2008 or 2009. Is -- I guess is that, a, the right rate? And b, is there any other differences that you would call out today?\nLynn Moore: Scott, I think, obviously, one of the clearest examples of difference between '08, '09 and today is the speed and the shutdown. And the impact, as John mentioned earlier, back then, after coming out of the great recession, we had a year where we were essentially flat, maybe even a little down in revenues, but that wasn't until 2010. The impact on the economy was a little bit slower. Here we obviously have a much more forced, self imposed closure. So, I think the compression of the effects may be a little bit stronger.  So still hard to know. I do think, as we said earlier, our Q2 and Q3, we're going to learn a little bit more as we go into some more budget cycles. But I would say the speed of the compression and any associated lag, maybe a little shorter. Another difference for us personally, and one of the things that makes me even more positive today is the position that Tyler's in today versus where we were 12 years ago. We talked about our balance sheet, we talked about our cash position, go back to 2008, 2009, our balance sheet was a lot different story. We probably had somewhere around only 10 million in cash and probably around equal amount in debt. And today we're in different position. Our recurring revenues as a model, I think back then were less than half of our overall revenues. Today they're approaching 70%, 71%.  We've been investing back then one of our biggest initiatives was to invest during that time, we've been doing that leading up to that. So, a lot of investments we've been making are prime to the coming online and poised to take, really take position of where we are when we come out of this. So, at a high level, that's what I'd say the difference. There certainly are some similarities, but it's certainly not identical. It gives me a lot of comfort to know that this company has been through that, being able to talk with, and obviously, I was here part of this team, but we've got senior leaders up and down the management team who were part of this company, let it through there. It gives us confidence and what we've done in the past and what we can do in the future. And that's really something that's great to lean on. It's good to be able to lean on each other and know that we're on the right course.\nScott Berg: Got it quite helpful. Thanks for that, Lynn. And then from a follow perspective, both in the press release and on the call here, you all called out the impact of some of your ability to deliver professional services. It's sound that clearly can be moved from only but you've had a decent amount that's been delivered on-premise, what the customer over the last multiple years. Can you help quantify maybe what that impact looks like in the short-term? Or is it still just too difficult to build, maybe ascertain in terms of the impact of them in the court? Thank you.\nBrian Miller: Scott, this is Brian. There are a couple of pieces to it. One, we're delivering the vast majority of our services remotely. And as we mentioned earlier, we are seeing customers who typically  just expected that those things would be on site, even if we have the ability to do it remotely that are they're certainly now more flexible about it. I'd say we were probably delivering somewhere around 85% of what we would have planned. And there's also a little bit of short-term adjustment as customers also all in one place to be able to accept some of the training or services. So I think that will continue to moderate as we go through this longer. One of the other factors is that included in services revenues, a significant amount of billable travel. Something on the order of $5 million a quarter of revenues that we recognize that are effectively little to know margin on those, but certainly affect our revenues. So they're grossed up on our income statement. And we've seen that go to just about zero. And again, we don't know exactly how rapidly that travel will resume. But likely some services will permanently be delivered remotely. And from an efficiency standpoint, utilization of our staff standpoint, that's a positive, but it will have an effect on -- negative effect on revenues, positive effect on margins.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson.\nPeter Heckmann: Hey, good morning. Thanks for all the information. Just a little follow-up on the pulling guidance and some of your commentary around maybe a more likely range for revenue growth, your prior guidance was calling for 11% to 13% growth and if I heard you correctly, they said maybe mid single digit might be more likely. When we think about that, I mean, is there a reasonable chance that the non-recurring portion of revenue could be down for the year versus prior expectations?\nLynn Moore: Yes, so Peter, as we said before, there's a little bit of uncertainty right now. There are still deals going forward. What we see is particularly deals that are in their later stages are going forward. We talked earlier, Scott was asking about implementation services, same thing, those that are more in the middle of projects versus the beginning of the projects are continuing. What we see right now that's sort of our best guess for the rest of the year. We met with management last week, as we do every quarter. We had them really give us their best guess on the impact of COVID on their particular business units. And it varies a little bit from business unit to business unit. Our business units recognize revenue differently. Some are more PLC based. Some work at a backlog, some little more dependent on quarterly licensed sales. But we met with them, we talked with them, we had them present what they considered sort of, bear case, bull case, and best case and we as a management team got together and said, this is sort of where we think we're going to land. As we said in my earlier comments, I'd expect you to have a lot more clarity in our Q2 conference call. And I'd probably like to reserve until the end to make much more detail on that.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. And then just a follow-up. I didn't hear you say at the Brian, look like the average term on subscription deals was a little over 50%. Can you talk about year-over-year growth of bookings on a constant term basis?\nBrian Miller: Yes. The term had been the same bookings growth for the quarter were that right at 20%. There were, as you mentioned, there were two large $24 million and a $14 million SaaS deals both with the state of North Carolina as that were 10 year deals consistent with our tenure, court case management deal there. If you've taken those two deals out, the average term would have been about 4.3 years on all the rest of the contracts. But yes, it would have been right at 20% without if the term is in the same as last year's Q1.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Vanvliet with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nMatt Vanvliet: I guess, wanted to dig in a little bit on some of the dynamics of the bookings through the quarter through April and what the pipeline is looking like and sort of what the sales forecasts are maybe seeking out on sort of a three six month basis, but you're looking at what your sales teams are focused on. Is there been a greater focus on contacting existing customers where you have the relationship and getting more response rates and sort of seeing what you can do from sort of virtual and work from home type elements with those customers? Are you seeing traction on new customers? Just curious and what the focus is then there? And then across the product platform? Are you narrowing your focus for the next couple months on specific areas that are allowing more e-filing allowing more remote contact? Or are you continuing to see sort of a broad based approach to the sales leadership? \nLynn Moore: Yes, thanks, Matt. So I guess initially, you talk about pipeline. And I just want to reiterate our comments that we made earlier. There may be a slight demand in pause. But there's no real fundamental change in our industry demand. And right now, we don't really see a change in our pipeline. But although we do recognize there will be delays. We really haven't seen any meaningful cancellations.  As it relates to sales, it varies a little bit as I said, some processes that were already well down the road, those are continuing. We are doing remote demos, which are a little more different in fact, we just finished one last week and received an award after 13 hours of doing virtual remote demos. So a little bit new. Some of the things we talked about internally. We talked about, what are things, mitigation things steps that we can make, but also what types of opportunities are out there.  One of the things I think Tyler's always been really good about is while keeping their discipline also staying opportunistic. And some of the things you're missing you're talking about are some things we're talking about. We do believe that this will help accelerate the move to the cloud. So you see our sales, people will start talking about that they'll start promoting cloud and they start promoting our flips. We will put more emphasis on our mobile solutions, things like in our public safety mobility, even our payments. And my things like MyCivic, you talked about messaging. I think there was a question earlier, this is a really good opportunity to really sort of start honing our message on ROI. I mean, it's something that we know internally, but may not have always been a top priority for some of our customers. So, I think some of those things we're doing, and again, the impact of sales is sort of, you talked about reaching out to clients. Sometimes, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, just there's some logistical difficulties right now, because you have work from home environments, but we've talked about those messages and make sure that we're going to be equipped for when things return to normal.\nMatt Vanvliet: Great. And then as you talk about, unlikely to have to remove any positions, but maybe hiring gets pulled back a little bit. Are there specific areas where in the near term, you're focusing on reducing hiring versus previous plan? Or is it just a general pause now to reassess over the next weeks and months of where business is picking back up and more of the focus is from a hiring perspective?\nLynn Moore: Yes. So, I would say the message I\u2019ve sort of given to the team is cautious optimism. We need to see how things play out. But we -- but let\u2019s not to forget the optimism part. We already had made some significant hires this year as part of our plans. As we've mentioned before, we're going to continue to invest in our long term strategic initiatives and so all those debt projects going to keep going and when you step back and you look at potential projects being delayed and things like that there may be some slight pause in hiring some of those services components. But overall, we're committed to our workforce committed to running the business in such a way that our current employees won't be impacted. We will continue to do some hiring. And as the year unfolds, and when we start seeing return to normal, and we'll start seeing some of that hiring again.\nJohn Marr: And just to give you a little perspective, our plans for the year going into the year were to add about 500 net new heads. So we have a fair amount of flexibility there leavers to pull with respect to the timing and the volume of there\u2019s -- but everyone said most likely on the professional services and implementation where we, I think, can plan to hire a couple of hundred people during the year that will likely be adjustments to that hiring, reflecting the change in more than being delivered remotely and delay.\nMatt Vanvliet: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Hope everyone stays safe and healthy.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning guys. I just trying to reconcile the commentary in terms of deals being pushed off. And the ability to maintain the operating margin, is really that a function of the fact that perhaps your hiring this is not going to be as great. I guess the concern here is that your revenues not going to grow as much as you anticipated?\nBrian Miller: I think the biggest factor there is, yes, there'll be less hiring and your expenses there, there are some offsets to expenses, particularly travel expense we mentioned health claims are down significantly and travel to any, I'd say the other big thing is that a lot of the revenues that are being reduced are our lowest margin revenues. I mentioned billable travel which has almost no margin. The professional services as you know are very low margin revenues for us. And even removing Connect, we mentioned we\u2019ll take $6 million of revenues out of Q2 but that had no margin associated with it. So, the higher margin revenues, the subscription, some of the transaction based revenues, those are growing nicely. So the change in the profile net sales to something we believe we can still maintain flattish margins with last year, which was the expectations we came into the year.\nKeith Housum: And then I guess as you try to think into 2021, is there concern that the budgetary pressures are being felt now by the local agencies, is that this could carry over into a multi-year I guess headwind?\nLynn Moore: Well, I think that's a possibility, as John alluded to earlier, there's different ways that projects are funded. There's different budget cycles. There are significantly still a lot of funding resources. One other things that people tend to forget or may not emphasize is that they're a lot of funding sources, property taxes are still probably the major funding source for state local government, really for local government, excuse me, for counties and cities. They comprise an overwhelming proportion of revenues as opposed to say sales tax. If you look at sales tax revenues, which are generally considered to be down, those comprise more around 7% of a budget for a county or city.  I also expect that there will be some more funding coming from the federal government. I think you may have seen earlier this week, that the Fed announced that it was broadening the number of local governments from which it would allow them to buy debt for them. Originally, they had talked about doing things for counties that were only 2 million and up, and that's been reduced to the populations of 500,000 cities to 250. But there will be some impact. And I think, it's our experience in the great recession was I mentioned earlier, the impact was really felt a little bit later. In my response to comments earlier, I think the thing about this is that there may be a little bit more compression in that impact. But, again, I think we'll have a little bit more clarity as we get through the year, particularly as we get through Q2, see the impacts, see what's happening as the states and local jurisdictions are returning to work. And then I think we'll be in a lot better position to answer that question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please go ahead. \nJonathan Ho: I guess, just going back to your comments around past crises and the opportunity to maybe invest. Where do you see maybe the most opportunity to do so this time around? \nLynn Moore: Yes, Jonathan, it's a good point. I think -- one thing I want to emphasize is something we've talked about for the last couple of years, which we have been -- we have already been investing at an elevated level. We've done that for a number of reasons. As I mentioned earlier, these projects, to me, that's an opportunity that we have initiated there's elevated investments across the board. I think you're going to continue to see us invest in our cloud initiatives. Those are not going away. And if anything, we may try to accelerate some of those. All the things that we've been talking about that are long-term strategic initiatives, we're going to continue to keep doing.  And then we'll continue across the broad base through our products. But again, I anticipate that this crisis will accelerate, further accelerate both the receptiveness and willingness as well as the move to the cloud. And I think we're going to continue to invest there heavily in the next couple years. \nJonathan Ho: And then just as a quick follow-up. Are there potentially any projects that maybe get pulled forward or emergency buying for things like virtual courts or MyCivic, just wanted to see if there's any maybe new demand that could come out of this that's unexpected? \nLynn Moore: We have a number of success stories out there but I would consider some quick responses from some of our divisions. We talked about virtual courts, we talked about what was going on in public safety. And I think, we've seen some of that. We have had a couple of deals where some local governments have tapped into emergency funding. I wouldn't say it's a significant number, but we've seen a little bit of that. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please go ahead.\nRob Oliver: Great. Thank you guys very much for taking my question. I can't remember a one month time period in my career where local and municipal software has been in the news as much as it has over the past month or six weeks. I wanted to just ask about the North Carolina deals, you guys have to be extremely pleased with the follow on, the sizeable follow on wins in North Carolina. And I was just wondering if we could get a little bit more color on those? And then obviously, in the near term, there'll be some uncertainty but the extent to which you guys are able to template, your success in North Carolina and for that to other states would love to hear more? And I have one follow-up.\nLynn Moore: Yes, thanks, Rob. Yes. North Carolina has been a real success story for us. And you're right we're very excited. We talked about it last summer, when we announced the North Carolina Courts deal. One of the things we specifically talked about what some of the potential upside sell opportunities, we called out Brazos in particular. We spent a lot of time talking about the Brazos e-citations deal at the end of Q4, really great deal, largest deal really in Brazos history. Running in AWS, it's a great story. Shifting gears to something that we haven't talked a lot in detail as much as this Odyssey e-warrants. And again, this is a really great story. This is for a lot of reasons. Our Odyssey e-warrants is really all about its electronic transmissions of warrant applications between police officers in the field, and a judge who may be sitting in a courtroom or maybe at home at night. These are things that are time sensitive, potentially middle in night, evidentiary matters, maybe drawing blood on someone at a DY accident or doing something that's really have a time sensitive nature. This was a legacy product that state of North Carolina had. They talked with us about it and we said, hey, we can build that. And they trusted us. They building on that relationship. It's a 100% cloud base, built in AWS, it's going to be spun up very quickly. Target to go-live is actually next year, we expect to have about 49,000 users. It's a great story and it really further evidences our connected communities vision as we realize that it's, you're connecting the agencies, you're connecting the police agencies with the courts. Do you think it can be a differentiator not only on our court side, but also on our public safety side. So it's a really good opportunity. It's something that I'm extremely excited about. You said it builds on that earlier big contract with at the state of North Carolina. Your question about thinking a little bit broader. I think that e-warrants opportunity in North Carolina. It's a nice statewide opportunity. I think as you look out, I don't know that as you go to other jurisdictions, it will be on a statewide basis, I think you'll see a lot more deals more locally at the county level, you'll see things in some of our larger clients. So nobody else has this out in the market. I think it's something that's exciting as we look forward.\nRob Oliver: And then maybe going back to the first question that Kirk Materne asked. Obviously, your customers are showing a greater appetite for subscription, you guys have been kind of consistently beating the subscription number. And I know as John said, short and medium term, we're likely to see impact here from COVID. But as we all know, go back and try to look for patterns in comparison. So we go back to our way and that flattest slightly down here, you guys had, obviously that was perpetual license model at that point and, come to get people to make big purchases. Just wondering, if you could perhaps speculate on how the trajectory might be different. And if there's any early signs of that subscription buying could help change the trajectory out of this downturn this time. Appreciate it, guys. Thank you very much.\nLynn Moore: Well, you raised a good point. We weren't a lot different model back then in 2008, 2009. And certainly, as we go back to even say, the 911 or Y2K. I think coming around 2009, I think Tyler's subscription revenues were only about 17 million a year. Today, we're north of 300 million, which is obviously a different situation. The trajectory, as we talked about was a little bit delayed there. The impact was a little bit longer lasting. But as you look at a couple years, I think past, as past the recovery, I think Tyler's revenue growth was more in the 18% range. So the question is, how quick does that come? As we talk a lot of times, as we continue to move more to a subscription model, it's obviously a lot better long-term, it won't have necessarily the same pop into short-term. But as John's comments mentioned earlier, we feel really confident about our ability to be positioned to get an overwhelming piece of our share of the business as this pent up demand and I believe will return as we get on the other side of this.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tyler Wood with Northland Securities. Please go ahead.\nTyler Wood: Just one from me. You mentioned last quarter public safety win with Orlando and kind of your optimism there with large cities. Can you give us an update on that, maybe how the pipeline looks at that high end of the market in Q1, before things ground to a halt? And then just more generally, a little bit of color on your thinking around the COVID impact, and how it will vary between those larger Tier 1 to Tier 2 cities versus smaller local cities? \nLynn Moore: Yes, sure Tyler. It's interesting when I talked earlier about this different business units. We've talked about that some times in the past as to how their customer base may be -- may or may or may not be more or less receptive to certain things. I would say in Q1, of all of our business segments, public safety probably was impacted a little bit more than our others. And primarily because the market they serve first responders and they're extremely focused on really more pressing local needs. We just spent a lot of time at the last call talking about the momentum in the market, that momentum is there, it's real. There are a number of large opportunities. I can say that a couple of them have been pushed. But as you look and we track and what we've track over the last several years is, is we track our ability to move up market, larger deals, larger license deals, deals in excess of 1 million approaching 2 million, but also the size of the customer in terms of calls for service as you approached over 500,000 to approaching a million. And those opportunities are continuing to be there. We did have see some delays there. I think we also saw in the public safety areas that customer base was probably a little bit customer base was probably a little bit more reluctant in the first quarter and since to accept remote delivery services. But in terms of overall demand and our ability to fill that demand, we are as confidence we were last quarter. The investments we've made are paying off. We're continuing to invest in those products, we continue to do things that we've talked about like mobility that are going to only make our products even that much more available, or more desirable.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Joe Goodwin with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nJoe Goodwin : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just had a question around your -- how are you guys thinking about M&A in this environment? And maybe you could provide some color around the M&A pipelines and what that's looking like and kind of happening there? Thank you.\nLynn Moore: Yes, sure, Joe. I think generally, I probably just want to step back and just sort of, looking at what we've done historically and sort of our approach, our approach has always been to be very opportunistic. We've obviously done a lot of acquisitions. I think we talked last year, we had done about -- since 2018 and last year, we sort of taken approaches, a little bit of a deliberate pause, I would say, as we need to really integrate those acquisitions and make some investments and revise some product strategies. I think coming out towards the end of last year, our approach would have returned what I consider a more normal approach, which is something that we continually look at -- continue to look for opportunities. In recent years, we've talked a lot about the fact that it's been tough to do acquisitions, which is one reason why we've been increased our R&D spend. That's been for a number of reasons. There have been some hyper inflated valuations by sellers, a lot of bidding by PE firms. As I look out forward, I think we're going to continue to be opportunistic, I do think there's going to be an opportunity out there. I think the current environment may create some additional opportunities. We may see opportunities where we may have a few more motivated sellers. Some of their valuations may become more in line with what we think are reasonable. Some of the competition for some of these deals, which in the last several years have been PE firms, we've talked about the leverage that they've got on their balance sheets and the issues this pandemic may cause for them. So we may be able to compete a little bit better on our terms as we have in the past. It's been part of our history. We're going to continue to be optimistic and I expect that to continue as we go forward.\nOperator: At this time there appears to be no more questions. Mr. John Marr, I will turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nJohn Marr: Great. Thanks, Brent. Thanks for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your interest. Obviously, in interesting time and we appreciate all the questions. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to Brian, Lynn or myself. Thank you very much. Stay safe. Have a good day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn? Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2020. In our earnings release, we've included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results in comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the investor relations section of our website under the financial reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the first quarter were $276.5 million, up 11.9%. On a non-GAAP basis, revenues were $276.8 million, up 11.3%. Organic revenue growth was 6.4% on a GAAP basis and 5.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Our core software license and subscription revenues combined grew organically 8.3% on non-GAAP basis. Subscription revenues for the quarter increased 21.5%. We added 131 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 19 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $101 million in total contract value. In Q1 of last year, we added 128 new subscription-based arrangements and had 13 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $49 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprise approximately 73% of new -- total new software contracts value signed this quarter compared to 54% in Q1 last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 5.9 years, compared to 4.1 years in Q1 last year, with the increase caused by the two large 10 year contracts with the state of North Carolina mentioned earlier. Revenues from e-filing and online payments which are included in subscriptions increased 14.7% to $22 million. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $14.9 million up to 1.7% over last year, and e-payments revenue of $7.1 million up 56.7%. For the first quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue or ARR was $785 million up 16.2%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q1 was approximately $239 million, up 22.8%, transaction based ARR was approximately $88 million up 14.7% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $458 million up 13.3%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter reached a new high of $1.5 billion up 19.2%, backlog included $369 million of maintenance compared to $353 million a year ago. Subscription backlog was $668 million compared to $489 million last year, and includes approximately $128 million related to fixed fee e-filing contracts. Including our e-filing contract with the state of Texas, which was extended for one year through August of 2022 during the quarter.  As Lynn noted, our bookings were very strong again this quarter at approximately $319 million, an increase of 39.8% from Q1 of last year. But the trailing 12 months bookings were approximately $1.4 billion, up 37%.  Our software subscription bookings in the quarter added $12.6 million in new annual recurring revenue up 10.7% over last year's $11.4 million. For comparison it's all of our new subscription contracts have been under licensed arrangements, we estimated that they would have represented additional license revenue of approximate $20 million. As a reminder, our bookings comparison in the second quarter will be a very tough one, irrespective of the impact of COVID-19. Last year's second quarter bookings were record $452 million an included our largest contract in history, the $85 million SaaS contract for the North Carolina Courts, as well as the $20 million SaaS contract with Bear County, Texas Courts. Cash flow from operations more than doubled to $56.7 million and free cash flow quadrupled to $46 million, primarily due to strong collection of receivables. During the quarter, we repurchase 58,804 shares of our stock for a total of $15.5 million, or an average of approximately $263 per share. We ended the quarter with $393 million in cash and investments and no outstanding debt. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn for the discussion on the impact of and our responses to the COVID-19 pandemics. Lynn? Scott, this is Brian. There are a couple of pieces to it. One, we're delivering the vast majority of our services remotely. And as we mentioned earlier, we are seeing customers who typically  just expected that those things would be on site, even if we have the ability to do it remotely that are they're certainly now more flexible about it. I'd say we were probably delivering somewhere around 85% of what we would have planned. And there's also a little bit of short-term adjustment as customers also all in one place to be able to accept some of the training or services. So I think that will continue to moderate as we go through this longer. One of the other factors is that included in services revenues, a significant amount of billable travel. Something on the order of $5 million a quarter of revenues that we recognize that are effectively little to know margin on those, but certainly affect our revenues. So they're grossed up on our income statement. And we've seen that go to just about zero. And again, we don't know exactly how rapidly that travel will resume. But likely some services will permanently be delivered remotely. And from an efficiency standpoint, utilization of our staff standpoint, that's a positive, but it will have an effect on -- negative effect on revenues, positive effect on margins. Yes. The term had been the same bookings growth for the quarter were that right at 20%. There were, as you mentioned, there were two large $24 million and a $14 million SaaS deals both with the state of North Carolina as that were 10 year deals consistent with our tenure, court case management deal there. If you've taken those two deals out, the average term would have been about 4.3 years on all the rest of the contracts. But yes, it would have been right at 20% without if the term is in the same as last year's Q1. I think the biggest factor there is, yes, there'll be less hiring and your expenses there, there are some offsets to expenses, particularly travel expense we mentioned health claims are down significantly and travel to any, I'd say the other big thing is that a lot of the revenues that are being reduced are our lowest margin revenues. I mentioned billable travel which has almost no margin. The professional services as you know are very low margin revenues for us. And even removing Connect, we mentioned we'll take $6 million of revenues out of Q2 but that had no margin associated with it. So, the higher margin revenues, the subscription, some of the transaction based revenues, those are growing nicely. So the change in the profile net sales to something we believe we can still maintain flattish margins with last year, which was the expectations we came into the year."

            "name": "John Marr",
            "content": "Thank you, Brent, and welcome to our first quarter 2020 earnings call. With me on the call today are Lynn Moore, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, Lynn will have some preliminary comments, and Brian will review the details of the first quarter results. This will be followed by a discussion of the impact and our responses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. And I'll have some final comments and we'll take your questions. Thanks, Lynn and Brian. Obviously, a little different call and unusual and a lot of information to digest. Before we take your questions, I'd like to reinforce a few of the highlights. First, I want to add my recognition and appreciation to the entire Tyler team, as well to the strong leadership that Lynn and his executive team have provided. We deliver and support a lot of great technology. But the true value of Tyler exists in our 5500 incredible employees. These professionals are what differentiate Tyler from all other players in this space. Lynn and Brian provided a lot of data points in detail. I'll just add one of my own anecdotal observations. Nearly every day for the past month, and we drive through the parking lots of the two larger facilities here in Maine, where normally there would be 500 or 600 cars. I need to admit after seeing this company grow to this level over the past 20 years, it can be a little discouraging to see nearly completely empty parking lots. But then as I talk to our leadership team, I'm told that the dev and R&D projects are on schedule. Customer support issues are being handled and close was better than the normal response times. And go live continue to move forward. As Lynn has been saying it's not only impressive, it's inspiring. From early in the morning until literally midnight or past there, thousands of Tyler employees are tunneled into the network and cranking out the work. These people have lives, children, homeschooling, spouses working, some of them in the healthcare professions in their own commitments. One interesting fact is that the highest network activity is late at night. 8, 10, 12 o'clock. Literally hundreds, sometimes thousands are online getting the work done after the other challenges of the day have been satisfied.  It's incredible to witness, it's also gratifying to know that we have a business model strategy and we're in a position where these jobs are secure, and Tyler will only grow stronger. Yes, we will be impacted in the short and likely medium term. As you've heard, sales cycles will lengthen our ability to travel the customer sites will have an impact, and there will be some incremental pressure on government budgets at all levels. But the fundamentals that we are built on aren't changing. Everything we do is centered around essential enterprise applications. Our customers will survive and we're aligning technology even more to recover. They're still going to run payrolls, manage courts, dispatch first responders, appraise properties, and on and on. But now, there is some uncertainty. The Tyler will grow this year will be profitable, will strengthen our already strong balance sheet, and most importantly, will execute on all the key strategic and competitive initiatives. This simply won't be true for most of our competitors. Smaller startup types don't have the financial strength. Many of our competitors are peeking around and saddled with significant debt, limiting their investment flexibility. Other horizontal players, this isn't a first or highest priority, and they'll have to make difficult decisions. I'm not suggesting there won't be other good competitors on the other side of this thing. There always will be, but I'm certain that Tyler will be stronger on the other side. Whatever negative impact may occur over the next couple of quarters, it's just timing. If a decision or replacing system is delayed, that's all it is delayed. We saw this in the great recession with a slow year, year and a half and then a very robust recovery. It's a net zero game and when those deals come back online, I'm confident our win rates will only be higher.  Now Brent, we'll take questions It hard to know, Kirk. Some of the budget here are actually different around the country. Some people go out, do their due diligence, go through a selection process and then go to finance committees for funds, others get the money appropriated and know they have it and then execute the process. So it'll be a little bit all over the place. That's obviously why we suspend guidance. As we've said, 70% of our business is recurring, we don't see it to be affected in a meaningful way. A lot of the other 30 comes out of backlog and is pretty essential there has to occur. And so you end up with a small piece of our business that's important to us. But it's a little less predictable at this point in time, and we'll just kind of have to see how things unfold. As I've said, and what we experienced in the great recession was the deals that got pushed, they all occurred. Back then, we actually had a flat revenue year and we've negative $1 million, the only time it's ever happened. And then we had several very strong years following that. So it's really just a shift in the timing. If they need new systems, they simply need them and they will replace them. But I think the next few quarters will be hard to see, other than the practice in our case, they are on a small percentage of our business, that's a risk and the vast majority of it stays in place. I think the bigger driver from this incident is just the availability of technology. So with everybody working from home, with the citizen and partner facing apps, applications, much of that's just much more reliable in the cloud. So, some of these people on legacy systems that are hosted in city halls, county offices, courthouses, it's been much more difficult for them to provide that kind of access in a reliable fashion in partnering with somebody that runs a modern technology, advanced cloud system, gives them far greater flexibility. So I think that will be the bigger driver to accelerate the movement of cloud. And just to give you a little perspective, our plans for the year going into the year were to add about 500 net new heads. So we have a fair amount of flexibility there leavers to pull with respect to the timing and the volume of there's -- but everyone said most likely on the professional services and implementation where we, I think, can plan to hire a couple of hundred people during the year that will likely be adjustments to that hiring, reflecting the change in more than being delivered remotely and delay. Great. Thanks, Brent. Thanks for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your interest. Obviously, in interesting time and we appreciate all the questions. If you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to Brian, Lynn or myself. Thank you very much. Stay safe. Have a good day."

            "content": "Thanks, Brian. We got a very solid first quarter with a great deal of momentum going into the second half of March, when we began to see the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The market was active and we executed at a high level. This was our 34 consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. As GAAP revenues grew 11.9% and non-GAAP revenues grew 11.3%. Organic revenue growth was 6.4% for GAAP revenues, and 5.7% for non-GAAP revenues. Our core software revenues from licenses and subscriptions grew 12.1% on a non-GAAP basis, with 8.3% organic growth. We continue to experience an increasing preference among clients for cloud offerings, as subscription arrangements represented 73% of new contract value signed this quarter. Of course, this was pressure on short-term revenue growth, but generates higher revenues and margins over the long-term. GAAP subscription revenues grew 21.5% and non-GAAP subscription revenues grew 20.5%. Subscription revenue growth has now exceeded 20% for 11 consecutive quarters and 52 of the last 57 quarters. Total recurring revenues from maintenance and subscriptions grew 17.1% on a GAAP basis, and comprised approximately 71% of total revenues. It was another extremely strong quarter for bookings, which were up 39.8%, our second consecutive quarter of greater than 30% bookings growth. Our two largest SaaS deals in the quarter led the way, both we're following contracts with the state of North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts. The first was for our new Odyssey e-warrant solution and was valued at approximately $24 million. The second contract, which we noted on our last earnings call, was for our Brazos e-citation solution, valued at approximately $14.5 million. Both of these 10 year SaaS agreements expand on the relationship with North Carolina that started with our largest SaaS agreement ever, an $85 million contract signed last June for Odyssey case management in e-filling solutions. And demonstrate our ability to grow our client relationships across our broad portfolio of integrated solutions. We signed two other SaaS deals in the quarter that each had a contract value of greater than $6 million. One with DuPage County, Illinois, for our IS World Appraisal solution, and one with the city of Richardson, Texas, where multi suite arrangement for our Munis ERP, ExecuTime, time and attendance and EnerGov Civic Services, Incode Courts and Socrata Data Insights Solutions takes full advantage of our connected communities vision. We also signed five new SaaS arrangements with contract values greater than $3 million. Four of those deals, were for our Munis ERP solution with the cities of Merced, Napa and Palm Springs, all in California, as well as Napa County, California. The fifth was with the South Carolina Department of Education for the first statewide implementation of our Versatrans school transportation solution. Our largest on-premises license deal of the quarter was a $6.3 million contract with Beaver County, Pennsylvania for our IS World Appraisal solution, which also included appraisal services. We continue to widen our market share lead in the California Court Case Management market with a $4.4 million on-premises license contract with Contra Costa County for Odyssey Solution. We also signed a $2.7 million license arrangement with L.A. County for EnerGov Civic Services solution. Now I'd like to Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter, and then we'll move to discussion of COVID-19. Thanks, Brian. In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and its effect on the economy, I want to share information on how Tyler Technologies approaching this challenge and its impact on our business. First, our operational response. Tyler's nearly 5500 team members continue to provide a high standard of client service with mi nimal disruption. Our primary focus has been on ensuring that our employees and their families are safe and healthy, while supporting clients who provide essential services to the public. Most of our offices already had many staff members who normal workdays involve remote work environments. Beginning in mid-March, we transition quickly to work from home for all of our staff. Equipping our employees to continue their work uninterrupted and also curtail travel for our employees. Our clients face increasing disruption to their operations, as they dealt with the effects of the pandemic on their communities, and focused on providing vital services to their citizens. In March, we began seeing delays in some procurement processes, and finalizing some existing contract awards became logistically more difficult. Some implementation appraisal service projects were also delayed, as clients were grappling with balancing local shelter in place and social distance orders while conducting daily operations. Trade shows where large numbers of vendors and prospective clients gather in person were scheduled or rescheduled or canceled. We are addressing the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic by adapting the way we do business, using web and video conferencing extensively for collaboration, conducting sales demos, providing client support and delivering professional services such as training remotely, and even executing complex go lives virtually. With the spread of COVID-19, our clients need for digital connectedness both within the organization and directly with the public is rapidly shifting from a vision to an urgent requirement. In recent weeks, we've seen many examples of our team members working with our clients to adapt to the current environment in truly inspiring ways. I'd like to highlight a few examples. San Bernardino County, California, pulled off a completely virtual go-live of our Odyssey court case management system by pivoting to our remote command center model. The go-live would ordinarily have involved a number of Tyler team members travelling to be on site. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated the launch of our new virtual core solution and we are offering it without charge for 90 days, in order to help court client serve their constituents without interruption. Since the official launch last month, more than 16 courts have selected this solution to handle cases remotely, removing the burden of having defendants physically appear in a courtroom, while also broadening access to justice for disadvantaged or displaced defendants. The New York State Division of Veterans Affairs deployed our Entellitrak solution in under a week. So it's staff to continue to approve claims remotely, ensuring that veterans in the state will continue to have access to benefits. Numerous law enforcement agencies optimize their new world computer aided dispatch tools to flag calls for service or someone might be a COVID-19 carrier, allowing officers to take necessary precautions. School districts are using Tyler Traversa Ride 360 app temporarily offered free of charge to assist with parent communications during the crisis, and are using our school bus routing software to plan meal deliveries to families in need. The Superior Court of San Luis Obispo California worked with Tyler teams over a single weekend to customize its Odyssey guide and file solution. So domestic violence complaints to be filed online while shelter in place orders are in effect. Numerous cities are using our MyCivic app to provide up to the date COVID-19 information to residents. I couldn't be prouder of how our dedicated professionals have embraced the challenge and are selling it meeting the needs of our clients. I'm constantly inspired by the spirit, resilience and compassion shown by our team members. With that backdrop, I'd like to make a few general comments about the financial impact of the pandemic on the quarter and the rest of 2020. As well as provide some thoughts on the long-term outlook and prospects for Tyler. Well, not material, the pandemic and response by clients and prospects did affect first quarter results. As I mentioned previously, a few sales pushed out in the first quarter, and professional services revenues, including global travel were also negatively impacted. We also canceled our annual user conference, Tyler Connect, which was scheduled to be held this week in Orlando. The costs associated with that cancellation, approximately $727,000 are included in our first quarter results. We estimate that the total revenue impact of COVID-19 in the first quarter was approximately $6 million. As we look out over the rest of 2020, we anticipate a greater impact from COVID-19 in the second and third quarters. While we have not seen meaningful cancellations, we continue to see delays in procurement processes and lengthening sales cycles, as public sector entities focus on issues related to pandemic. Although the Cares Act provided approximately 424 billion in economic aid to state and local governments, and additional stimulus packages are expected to provide more assistance. Many of our clients will face near term budget pressures. We can deliver the majority of our professional services remotely, but we expect to see lower services revenues as some projects are delayed by client availability. In addition, a number of courts have limited operations during the pandemic, which will impact transaction based e-filing revenues during this period.  In addition to these core revenues, approximately $6 million of revenues classified as hardware and other revenues will be eliminated in the second quarter as a result of the cancellation of our Connect conference. Billable travel will also be impacted significantly in the second quarter, but should return a safe begin to transition back from shelter in place to more normal operations.  While some of these variable revenue streams will continue to be impacted by the current environment, we anticipate that recurring revenues, which comprise approximately 70% of our total revenues will not be significantly affected. We expect to continue to invest in product development and accelerating our move to the cloud at levels consistent with our initial plans for the year.  We value the experience and expertise of our employees and do not expect to eliminate any positions, but anticipate the incremental hiring will be reduced somewhat from our original plans. We also expect to see reductions in some expenses, including travel and entertainment, trade shows and health claims.  As we remain confident in our long-term outlook, there are significant short-term uncertainties around the continuously evolving COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations and those of our clients. For example, government response to the pandemic will continue to vary significantly from state-to-state, and even from jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction within a state, thereby making the duration and scope of business restrictions within the public sector difficult to predict.  As a result, we are suspending our guidance until such time as we have more clarity around the ultimate severity, duration and impact of the pandemic. I expect to have more clarity on the impact of COVID-19 to our 2020 financial performance during our second quarter earnings call.  While our near-term outlook remains clouded by some uncertainty, given our high percentage of recurring revenues, it's my current expectation that Tyler revenues will still grow in the mid single-digits during 2020 with relatively flat operating margins compared to last year.  As I look out beyond the uncertainties created by the pandemic, I am as confident as ever in Tyler's long-term outlook and prospects. Tyler's fundamentals have never been stronger. Tyler has endured trying times in the past, including Y2K and the dot-com bust, 911 in the great recession. Each time, we emerged as a stronger company with an improved competitive position.  Unlike certain industries, the pandemic has not changed the underlying fundamentals and long-term demand for our software and services. Tyler exclusively serves the public sector, including local, state and federal government. Our clients will not go out of business, and the solutions we provide are essential, whether managing revenue to keep communities operating, ensuring public safety to help the most vulnerable, or providing transparency and access to government for the residents of the jurisdictions they serve.  Our software manages mission critical functions, such as 911, dispatch, courts, property taxes, utilities and payroll. Often our clients are acquiring solutions to replace aging systems that are end of life and may be unreliable or unsupported. Replacing those essential services is generally a high priority, regardless of the economic environment.  If anything, the current crisis is already highlighting the reliance on outdated technology by large segments of the public sector. You likely have seen recent news around issues related some of these decades-old COBOL based systems.  Long-term opportunities will emerge from this crisis as both Tyler and our clients we examine historical business practices. For example, work from home postures further highlight the need and benefits of connectivity and cloud services, something we've been actively investing in and are continuing with our strategic collaboration with AWS. Clients will continue to appreciate the value of data and being connected with others, with other departments and jurisdictions as well as its citizens. This is our connected communities vision, a vision that only Tyler can execute. Clients may become more willing to accept remote delivery of services, something they've been more reluctant to do in the past. Doing so makes our employees even more productive and efficient. And our ability to deliver uninterrupted, high quality support during these uncertaintimes, only further strengthens our bonds with clients and reinforces Tyler's messages of both agility and stability. As I mentioned earlier, Tyler has endured challenging times in the past and emerged stronger than before. Today, we believe, we are even better positioned to whether an economic slowdown. Recurring revenues comprise approximately 70% of our total, including newer transaction based revenue streams, like e-filing online payments. Our competitive position and win rates are stronger than ever. And we've significantly expanded our total addressable market through investments in a combination of M&A and Research and Development. And technology is increasingly critical factor in helping government function effectively, especially in difficult times. Our financial position is also the strongest it's ever been, with zero debt, nearly $400 million in cash and investments and substantial additional liquidity available through our $400 million undrawn credit facility, which can be further expanded through an accordion feature. As a result, we're able to continue to invest at a high level in all of our long-term strategic initiatives, something that companies with highly leveraged balance sheets or start-ups lacking the stability of highly recurring revenue base may not be able to do. Our ability to actively invest during the great recession was one of the key differentiators that strengthen our overall market position, when demand inevitably returned. We will continue to do the same during this crisis. We recognize this as an evolving situation. Tyler is fortunate to have a deep and broad base of knowledge and domain expertise across our employee group, which is approaching the situation with compassion and good humour. I am confident, we will see our way through these unusual circumstances with a spirit of cooperation, integrity and service that has been the hallmark of our company from the beginning. I can't be more proud and excited to be part of Tyler than I am now. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to John for his comments. Scott, I think, obviously, one of the clearest examples of difference between '08, '09 and today is the speed and the shutdown. And the impact, as John mentioned earlier, back then, after coming out of the great recession, we had a year where we were essentially flat, maybe even a little down in revenues, but that wasn't until 2010. The impact on the economy was a little bit slower. Here we obviously have a much more forced, self imposed closure. So, I think the compression of the effects may be a little bit stronger.  So still hard to know. I do think, as we said earlier, our Q2 and Q3, we're going to learn a little bit more as we go into some more budget cycles. But I would say the speed of the compression and any associated lag, maybe a little shorter. Another difference for us personally, and one of the things that makes me even more positive today is the position that Tyler's in today versus where we were 12 years ago. We talked about our balance sheet, we talked about our cash position, go back to 2008, 2009, our balance sheet was a lot different story. We probably had somewhere around only 10 million in cash and probably around equal amount in debt. And today we're in different position. Our recurring revenues as a model, I think back then were less than half of our overall revenues. Today they're approaching 70%, 71%.  We've been investing back then one of our biggest initiatives was to invest during that time, we've been doing that leading up to that. So, a lot of investments we've been making are prime to the coming online and poised to take, really take position of where we are when we come out of this. So, at a high level, that's what I'd say the difference. There certainly are some similarities, but it's certainly not identical. It gives me a lot of comfort to know that this company has been through that, being able to talk with, and obviously, I was here part of this team, but we've got senior leaders up and down the management team who were part of this company, let it through there. It gives us confidence and what we've done in the past and what we can do in the future. And that's really something that's great to lean on. It's good to be able to lean on each other and know that we're on the right course. Yes, so Peter, as we said before, there's a little bit of uncertainty right now. There are still deals going forward. What we see is particularly deals that are in their later stages are going forward. We talked earlier, Scott was asking about implementation services, same thing, those that are more in the middle of projects versus the beginning of the projects are continuing. What we see right now that's sort of our best guess for the rest of the year. We met with management last week, as we do every quarter. We had them really give us their best guess on the impact of COVID on their particular business units. And it varies a little bit from business unit to business unit. Our business units recognize revenue differently. Some are more PLC based. Some work at a backlog, some little more dependent on quarterly licensed sales. But we met with them, we talked with them, we had them present what they considered sort of, bear case, bull case, and best case and we as a management team got together and said, this is sort of where we think we're going to land. As we said in my earlier comments, I'd expect you to have a lot more clarity in our Q2 conference call. And I'd probably like to reserve until the end to make much more detail on that. Yes, thanks, Matt. So I guess initially, you talk about pipeline. And I just want to reiterate our comments that we made earlier. There may be a slight demand in pause. But there's no real fundamental change in our industry demand. And right now, we don't really see a change in our pipeline. But although we do recognize there will be delays. We really haven't seen any meaningful cancellations.  As it relates to sales, it varies a little bit as I said, some processes that were already well down the road, those are continuing. We are doing remote demos, which are a little more different in fact, we just finished one last week and received an award after 13 hours of doing virtual remote demos. So a little bit new. Some of the things we talked about internally. We talked about, what are things, mitigation things steps that we can make, but also what types of opportunities are out there.  One of the things I think Tyler's always been really good about is while keeping their discipline also staying opportunistic. And some of the things you're missing you're talking about are some things we're talking about. We do believe that this will help accelerate the move to the cloud. So you see our sales, people will start talking about that they'll start promoting cloud and they start promoting our flips. We will put more emphasis on our mobile solutions, things like in our public safety mobility, even our payments. And my things like MyCivic, you talked about messaging. I think there was a question earlier, this is a really good opportunity to really sort of start honing our message on ROI. I mean, it's something that we know internally, but may not have always been a top priority for some of our customers. So, I think some of those things we're doing, and again, the impact of sales is sort of, you talked about reaching out to clients. Sometimes, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, just there's some logistical difficulties right now, because you have work from home environments, but we've talked about those messages and make sure that we're going to be equipped for when things return to normal. Yes. So, I would say the message I've sort of given to the team is cautious optimism. We need to see how things play out. But we -- but let's not to forget the optimism part. We already had made some significant hires this year as part of our plans. As we've mentioned before, we're going to continue to invest in our long term strategic initiatives and so all those debt projects going to keep going and when you step back and you look at potential projects being delayed and things like that there may be some slight pause in hiring some of those services components. But overall, we're committed to our workforce committed to running the business in such a way that our current employees won't be impacted. We will continue to do some hiring. And as the year unfolds, and when we start seeing return to normal, and we'll start seeing some of that hiring again. Well, I think that's a possibility, as John alluded to earlier, there's different ways that projects are funded. There's different budget cycles. There are significantly still a lot of funding resources. One other things that people tend to forget or may not emphasize is that they're a lot of funding sources, property taxes are still probably the major funding source for state local government, really for local government, excuse me, for counties and cities. They comprise an overwhelming proportion of revenues as opposed to say sales tax. If you look at sales tax revenues, which are generally considered to be down, those comprise more around 7% of a budget for a county or city.  I also expect that there will be some more funding coming from the federal government. I think you may have seen earlier this week, that the Fed announced that it was broadening the number of local governments from which it would allow them to buy debt for them. Originally, they had talked about doing things for counties that were only 2 million and up, and that's been reduced to the populations of 500,000 cities to 250. But there will be some impact. And I think, it's our experience in the great recession was I mentioned earlier, the impact was really felt a little bit later. In my response to comments earlier, I think the thing about this is that there may be a little bit more compression in that impact. But, again, I think we'll have a little bit more clarity as we get through the year, particularly as we get through Q2, see the impacts, see what's happening as the states and local jurisdictions are returning to work. And then I think we'll be in a lot better position to answer that question. Yes, Jonathan, it's a good point. I think -- one thing I want to emphasize is something we've talked about for the last couple of years, which we have been -- we have already been investing at an elevated level. We've done that for a number of reasons. As I mentioned earlier, these projects, to me, that's an opportunity that we have initiated there's elevated investments across the board. I think you're going to continue to see us invest in our cloud initiatives. Those are not going away. And if anything, we may try to accelerate some of those. All the things that we've been talking about that are long-term strategic initiatives, we're going to continue to keep doing.  And then we'll continue across the broad base through our products. But again, I anticipate that this crisis will accelerate, further accelerate both the receptiveness and willingness as well as the move to the cloud. And I think we're going to continue to invest there heavily in the next couple years. We have a number of success stories out there but I would consider some quick responses from some of our divisions. We talked about virtual courts, we talked about what was going on in public safety. And I think, we've seen some of that. We have had a couple of deals where some local governments have tapped into emergency funding. I wouldn't say it's a significant number, but we've seen a little bit of that. Yes, thanks, Rob. Yes. North Carolina has been a real success story for us. And you're right we're very excited. We talked about it last summer, when we announced the North Carolina Courts deal. One of the things we specifically talked about what some of the potential upside sell opportunities, we called out Brazos in particular. We spent a lot of time talking about the Brazos e-citations deal at the end of Q4, really great deal, largest deal really in Brazos history. Running in AWS, it's a great story. Shifting gears to something that we haven't talked a lot in detail as much as this Odyssey e-warrants. And again, this is a really great story. This is for a lot of reasons. Our Odyssey e-warrants is really all about its electronic transmissions of warrant applications between police officers in the field, and a judge who may be sitting in a courtroom or maybe at home at night. These are things that are time sensitive, potentially middle in night, evidentiary matters, maybe drawing blood on someone at a DY accident or doing something that's really have a time sensitive nature. This was a legacy product that state of North Carolina had. They talked with us about it and we said, hey, we can build that. And they trusted us. They building on that relationship. It's a 100% cloud base, built in AWS, it's going to be spun up very quickly. Target to go-live is actually next year, we expect to have about 49,000 users. It's a great story and it really further evidences our connected communities vision as we realize that it's, you're connecting the agencies, you're connecting the police agencies with the courts. Do you think it can be a differentiator not only on our court side, but also on our public safety side. So it's a really good opportunity. It's something that I'm extremely excited about. You said it builds on that earlier big contract with at the state of North Carolina. Your question about thinking a little bit broader. I think that e-warrants opportunity in North Carolina. It's a nice statewide opportunity. I think as you look out, I don't know that as you go to other jurisdictions, it will be on a statewide basis, I think you'll see a lot more deals more locally at the county level, you'll see things in some of our larger clients. So nobody else has this out in the market. I think it's something that's exciting as we look forward. Well, you raised a good point. We weren't a lot different model back then in 2008, 2009. And certainly, as we go back to even say, the 911 or Y2K. I think coming around 2009, I think Tyler's subscription revenues were only about 17 million a year. Today, we're north of 300 million, which is obviously a different situation. The trajectory, as we talked about was a little bit delayed there. The impact was a little bit longer lasting. But as you look at a couple years, I think past, as past the recovery, I think Tyler's revenue growth was more in the 18% range. So the question is, how quick does that come? As we talk a lot of times, as we continue to move more to a subscription model, it's obviously a lot better long-term, it won't have necessarily the same pop into short-term. But as John's comments mentioned earlier, we feel really confident about our ability to be positioned to get an overwhelming piece of our share of the business as this pent up demand and I believe will return as we get on the other side of this. Yes, sure Tyler. It's interesting when I talked earlier about this different business units. We've talked about that some times in the past as to how their customer base may be -- may or may or may not be more or less receptive to certain things. I would say in Q1, of all of our business segments, public safety probably was impacted a little bit more than our others. And primarily because the market they serve first responders and they're extremely focused on really more pressing local needs. We just spent a lot of time at the last call talking about the momentum in the market, that momentum is there, it's real. There are a number of large opportunities. I can say that a couple of them have been pushed. But as you look and we track and what we've track over the last several years is, is we track our ability to move up market, larger deals, larger license deals, deals in excess of 1 million approaching 2 million, but also the size of the customer in terms of calls for service as you approached over 500,000 to approaching a million. And those opportunities are continuing to be there. We did have see some delays there. I think we also saw in the public safety areas that customer base was probably a little bit customer base was probably a little bit more reluctant in the first quarter and since to accept remote delivery services. But in terms of overall demand and our ability to fill that demand, we are as confidence we were last quarter. The investments we've made are paying off. We're continuing to invest in those products, we continue to do things that we've talked about like mobility that are going to only make our products even that much more available, or more desirable. Yes, sure, Joe. I think generally, I probably just want to step back and just sort of, looking at what we've done historically and sort of our approach, our approach has always been to be very opportunistic. We've obviously done a lot of acquisitions. I think we talked last year, we had done about -- since 2018 and last year, we sort of taken approaches, a little bit of a deliberate pause, I would say, as we need to really integrate those acquisitions and make some investments and revise some product strategies. I think coming out towards the end of last year, our approach would have returned what I consider a more normal approach, which is something that we continually look at -- continue to look for opportunities. In recent years, we've talked a lot about the fact that it's been tough to do acquisitions, which is one reason why we've been increased our R&D spend. That's been for a number of reasons. There have been some hyper inflated valuations by sellers, a lot of bidding by PE firms. As I look out forward, I think we're going to continue to be opportunistic, I do think there's going to be an opportunity out there. I think the current environment may create some additional opportunities. We may see opportunities where we may have a few more motivated sellers. Some of their valuations may become more in line with what we think are reasonable. Some of the competition for some of these deals, which in the last several years have been PE firms, we've talked about the leverage that they've got on their balance sheets and the issues this pandemic may cause for them. So we may be able to compete a little bit better on our terms as we have in the past. It's been part of our history. We're going to continue to be optimistic and I expect that to continue as we go forward."

Your host for today\u2019s call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, February 17, 2022. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Moore. Please go ahead.\nLynn Moore: Thank you, Gary, and welcome to our call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I\u2019d like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I\u2019ll have some comments on our quarter and then Brian will review the details of our results. I\u2019ll end with some additional comments on 2021 and our longer term outlook and then we\u2019ll take questions. Brian?\nBrian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company\u2019s future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Also, we're officially launching next week our new brand architecture, a broad company initiative that better organizes the name Tyler' Products and Solutions to represent the verticals and markets we serve. The new brand architecture uses functional descriptive product names and has eliminated all individual product logos. Tyler Solutions have been organized under five solution portfolios, public administration, health and human services, courts and public safety, schools and transformative technology. Throughout the call today, we'll refer to product and solution names using the new architecture. Lynn?\nLynn Moore: Thanks Brian. Our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations and continue to the positive momentum from the first three quarters to provide a strong finish to 2021. We're pleased that revenue growth continue to rebound, even as we experience revenue headwinds from the accelerating shift of new business to our SaaS model. Total revenues grew 53% with solid organic growth increasing to 9.2%. NIC continued its strong performance in the fourth quarter as well with core revenue growth of 7.5% excluding COVID related revenues. As expected, COVID related revenues declined sequentially from the third quarter of 2021 and were slightly above our plan at $16.6 million as the Omicron variant increased demand for testing in December and revenues from our new initiative supporting rent relief programs in Virginia came online. Recurring revenues comprised over 80% of our quarterly revenues for the second consecutive quarter and were led by 144% growth in subscription revenues. Excluding NIC revenues, subscription revenue growth was robust at 28.1% again, reflecting our accelerating shift to the cloud. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 56 of the last 64 quarters. We continue to experience pressure on margins in Q4, as we have throughout the year as a result of several factors. Some low margin revenues such as billable travel that declined substantially in 2020 due to the pandemic began to return in 2021. In addition, some expenses that also declined in 2020 have also started to return including business travel, trade shows and employee health costs. Margins have also been impacted by the inclusion of NIC including their lower margin gross payments contracts and COVID initiative revenues. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 330 basis points to 23.6%. And while our accelerating move to the cloud continues to build long term value, the increase in the SaaS mix of new business also weighed on our fourth quarter margins as SaaS accounted for 77% of our new contract volume in the quarter versus 73% last year. We continue to be very pleased with NIC's performance in the market and with the growing pipeline of joint opportunities for Tyler and NIC. During the fourth quarter NIC was successful in competitive rebids for enterprise contracts in South Carolina and Indiana payments and with renewals or extensions of enterprise agreements in Mississippi, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii and Texas Payments. We believe that Tyler's acquisition of NIC was a positive factor in the extension of these client relationships in particular, the inclusion of our enterprise data platform powered by Socrata was a material differentiator in the successful competitive rebid for South Carolina. We had nine combined sell through wins in the quarter where Tyler products were sold through NIC state enterprise contracts, or with influence from NIC state teams. These wins contained a number of Tyler products and services, including our enterprise data platform powered by Socrata, case management development platform powered by IntelliTrack, VendEngine, and NIC payments and generated over $1 million in new ARR for Tyler. We also continue to experience increased cross-selling opportunities across Tyler's product suites, especially for our enterprise data platform and our two largest new SaaS deals in the fourth quarter were examples. The first deal was with the city of Lawrence, Kansas valued at approximately $4.3 million and the second was with the city of Hammond, Indiana valued at approximately $3.8 million. Both new contracts included our enterprise ERP powered by Munis, enterprise permitting and licensing powered by EnerGov and enterprise data platform powered by Socrata Solutions among others. In addition, we signed a new combination license and SaaS deal with the Colorado division of Real Estate valued at nearly $1 million for our case management and development platform and enterprise data platform solutions, as well as NIC's electronic payment solution. This is also a great example of not only our ability to add value by offering multiple Tyler solutions in a single deal, but also the ability to win follow-on deals with various agencies. As you recall, in Q2 of 2021, we signed a $9.3 million contract with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies, Division of Professions and Occupations for similar products, which paved the way for this deal with the division of real estate. Other significant new SaaS operations signed this quarter each with a total contract value of greater than $2 million included the City of Camas, Washington for enterprise ERP and Enterprise Permitting and Licensing Solutions, Baton Rouge, Louisiana for Enterprise Justice and Supervision Solutions powered by Odyssey, the City of Taunton, Massachusetts for our enterprise ERP solution, Caldwell County, Texas for our Enterprise Justice and Jury Solutions and the City of Snoqualmie, Washington for our enterprise ERP solution. For our premise license contracts, notable new signings included the Lee County Clerk of the Courts and Comptroller in Florida valued at approximately $2.9 million and the City of Woodland, California valued at approximately $1.4 million for our enterprise ERP solution and the cities of Colorado Springs, Colorado and Salem, Oregon for our enterprise public safety solutions valued at approximately $2.4 million and $1.4 million respectively. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our guidance on 2022.\nBrian Miller: Thanks Lynn yesterday. Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we've belief facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the financial reports GAAP, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $433.5 million up 53% with the inclusion of NIC and our other acquisitions. Non-GAAP revenues were $434.2 million up 53.2%. On an organic basis GAAP and non-GAAP revenues both grew 9.2%. Software licenses and services grew 21.1% or 4.6% excluding NIC. Subscription revenues rose 144.1%. Excluding the contribution from NIC, subscription revenues were still very strong growing 28.1%. We added 135 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 71 existing on-premises clients representing approximately $74 million in total contract value. In Q4 of last year, we added 118 new subscription based arrangements and 50 on-premises conversions representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the fourth quarter added $14.8 million in new annual recurring revenue. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 77% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 73% in Q4 of last year, reflecting in our ongoing shift to a cloud first approach to sales and increasing client preferences for cloud based solutions. The valuated average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.9 years compared to 3.5 last year. Transaction based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions were $137.1 million up almost fivefold from last year. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $17.6 million up 13.4%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 14%. For the fourth quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue or ARR was approximately $1.4 billion up 63.7%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements for Q4 was approximately $372 million up 34%. Transaction based ARR was approximately $548 million up 458% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was down slightly at approximately $471 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.8 billion up 12.6%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction based, their backlog at quarter end was only $24 million. Excluding the addition of N I Tyler's backlog grew 11.1%. Our bookings in the quarter were robust at $464 million up 39.3%, including the transaction based revenues of NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were approximately $347 million up 4.2%. As a reminder, bookings in the fourth quarter of 2020 included a large contract for tax software and appraisal services valued at approximately only $18 million making for a tough bookings comparison. For the year, bookings were approximately $1.8 billion up 41.6% and on an organic basis, were approximately $1.4 billion up 11.7%. Our business continues to generate cash at a high level and for the fourth quarter, cash from operations grew almost 30% and free cash flow grew 13.7% to $95.1 million. Our balance sheet also remains very strong. During the quarter, we repaid $87.5 million for our term debt and since the NIC acquisition, we've repaid $395 million of debt. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.34 billion and cash in investments of $407.8 million and net leverage of approximately 2.07 times, trailing 12 months, pro forma EBITDA. Turning to 2022, our focus continues to be on our strategic activities around our cloud transition on several fronts. Although this creates some short term pressure on revenue, growth and margins that Lynn will discuss in more detail, we believe the acceleration of this strategy is creating significant long term value for shareholders and clients. Our 2022 annual guidance reflects the impact of these strategic activities and is as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.83 billion and $1.87 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 9.5%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $36 million of COVID related revenues from NIC's tour health and pandemic rent relief services. The tour health revenues are expected to continue through the first half of 2022 while revenues from the rent relief program are expected to continue throughout the year. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be be between $4.09 and $4.26, and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.41 and $7.58. To provide a little more color on our revenue guidance, we expect that our license revenues will decline in the mid-single digits in 2022, while subscription revenues will grow 25% to 30%. Excluding COVID related revenues, subscriptions are expected to grow in the mid to high thirties. Maintenance will be flat to down low single digits, software services, appraisal services and hardware and other revenues are each expected to grow in the low to mid-teens. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter results, especially with regard to our sales and revenue performance. Activity in the public sector market continues to trend positively with indicators such as RFP and demo activity generally at or above pre-COVID levels. It's also gratifying that our NIC operations are executing at a high level, and that we're seeing early successes in achieving the go to market objectives we envisioned around the acquisition. For example, NIC was recently awarded an early three year extension to its Texas Payments contract at existing rates. Similar to the South Carolina rebid, the inclusion of Tyler's enterprise data platform and in particular payment insights with fraud detection and prevention proved to be a major factor in obtaining this early extension. We're very excited to expand NIC's portfolio of software solutions with the acquisition of USC Direct, which we completed last week. USC Direct has a market leading AWS cloud hosted outdoor reservation platform for the fast growing campground and outdoor recreation management market, which complements our existing strength in the hunting and fishing license market. This combination will allow us to create a very competitive all in one outdoor solution, addressing an estimated $2 million market while also expanding our payments opportunity. USC Direct is now a part of our NIC division, and we welcome their 60 team members to Tyler. Now I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our accelerator move to the cloud, including the expected impact on our results in both the near term and the long term. As most of you know, we have operated in a hybrid model for many years, offering our core products in either an on-premises model with an upfront license and annual maintenance or a SaaS model with a software generally hosted in a Tyler data center and a multiyear subscription revenue stream. Since our first SaaS client Eau Claire [ph] Wisconsin chose Tyler in 2000. The mix of clients choosing our SaaS model grew slowly but steadily as we pursued a cloud agnostic approach to sales and let the market decide the pace at which it would move to the cloud. And as with many things in the public sector, our market has moved to the cloud more slowly than the private sector. In fact, it took until 2019 for the majority of our new business to come to us in the cloud a year in which we also recognize an all-time high $100.2 million in license revenues. 2019 was also the year in which we made the strategic decision to shift our future model from a cloud agnostic approach to a cloud first approach. In conjunction with that shift, we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Amazon web services and embarked on significant development efforts to optimize our key products, to be efficiently deployed in the cloud through AWS, with an ultimate goal of exiting our two proprietary data centers and eventually deploying all of our SaaS clients in the public cloud. Over the past two years, we've made substantial progress under our cloud first approach. I'm pleased to report that we remain on target with our product development initiatives with an expectation that all of our major products will be cloud efficient or cloud optimized by the end of 2023 or early 2024. In addition, almost every product we've added through acquisition in the last several years has been cloud native. We've begun deploying some new SaaS clients in AWS, as well as lifting and shifting a limited number of existing SaaS clients out of our data centers and into AWS. We've made changes to sales compensation to encourage cloud sales over licenses. In early 2021, we also created a new cloud strategy and operations team, which has responsibility for our overall cloud transformation strategy and operations, including things like defining best practices for cloud development, operations, and deployment to achieve the full value of our cloud initiative. And as we've embraced the cloud first approach, our market has also continued to embrace the cloud at an increasing rate. In 2021, 71% of our new soft contract value came to us in the cloud with that percentage reaching 77% in the fourth quarter and conversions of existing on-premises clients of the cloud have also reached new highs in each of the last three quarters. So clearly our shift to the cloud is in sync with the market as clients recognize the many benefits of cloud based solutions. This acceleration of our cloud transition is continuing as we move into 2022. Effective January 1, 2022, some of our major products, including enterprise ERP powered by Munis and enterprise permitting and licensing powered by EnerGov will almost exclusively be offered to new clients as cloud solutions. Other applications will follow. We expect that the percentage of new clients choosing the cloud model will continue to grow significantly in 2022, with the exception of public safety. With today, there has been more market reluctance to move systems to the cloud. The general impacts of a SaaS transition on a software company financial model are generally understood. From a revenue perspective, there's an initial headwind as licensed revenue that is generally recognized up front is replaced by a recurring subscription revenue stream. And unlike licenses, that recurring revenue stream is not recognized in full immediately. Rather revenue recognition typically begins when customers go live with particular models, which can take several quarters. However, because the annual recurring revenues from a subscription client are approximately 1.8 to two times the annual maintenance, the same client would generate in a license deal, the SaaS revenue stream is significantly higher over the life of a client. Some extent we have experienced this headwind for several years, but the impact is increasing as the shift accelerates. Over the next several years, as Brian mentioned, license and maintenance revenue will continue to decline while subscriptions will accelerate. For example, in 2019 maintenance revenues were 45% higher than subscriptions. In 2022, subscriptions will surpass maintenance revenues. From a margin perspective, there are multiple short-term headwinds as well. License revenues have very high margins with immediate impact and as they decline, margins are negatively impacted until the subscription revenue stream reaches the point where it offsets those lost licenses. In addition, we will experience some margin headwood from bubble costs around the transition from our internal data centers to the AWS hosting environment. We can currently host almost all of our more than 5400 SaaS clients in one of two main proprietary data centers. We have certain fixed costs associated with running those data centers, even as we transition the hosting of new and existing clients to AWS. Until we completely exit one and ultimately both of our data centers, we will incur some duplicative costs that put pressure on margins. Once we are in AWS with products that are architected to operate more efficiently in the public cloud, we will see an uplift in margins. With that backdrop, I'd like to turn to a closer look at our outlook for 2022 and beyond. Our revenue growth outlook is solid representing the continuing return to and growth over pre pandemic levels and our increasing competitive position. The midpoint of our guidance would represent approximately 16% total growth and 9.5% organic growth, even in light of the continued accelerated shift of new business to SaaS. We expect that approximately 80% of our new software contract mix in 2022 will be SaaS. From a margin perspective, the midpoint of our 2022 guidance implies non-GAAP operating margin contraction of approximately 160 basis points. That said, our implied 2022 non-GAAP operating margin is consistent with or even slightly higher than our 2021 Q4 operating margin as the major factors impacting margins began before this year. I'd like to break down a few of those factors. The first material category of margin pressures we consider to be part of our long term strategy of becoming a cloud first company, the impact of the year over year increase in our SaaS business mix, net of on-premises conversions, along with increasing bubble cost in 2022 will negatively impact operating profit by approximately $28 million to $30 million. The second significant category of factors causing margin pressure is made up of costs and low margin revenues that experience reductions during the pandemic, but have been slowly returning since the end of last year, in which we've discussed on prior calls. These include trade shows, sales related travel costs, and some billable travel. Importantly, some costs have not, and will not return to pre COVID levels. The third category of factors include some one time or non-discretionary costs. We like virtually every company are experiencing the effects of labor market disruptions and increased wage pressure and healthcare costs also continue to rise as a result of healthcare inflation combined with the catch up of expenses from healthcare that were deferred during the pandemic. We've posted on our website with a supplemental quarterly data, a summary of these margin challenges. The estimated total impact of all these items accounts for approximately 290 basis points of operating margin impact in our 2022 outlook. Looking beyond 2022, we expect that our margins will continue to be impacted by some of these factors, particularly declining license revenues and cloud transition bubble costs. We believe that operating margin pressures from the cloud transition will bottom out in 2023 and that beginning in 2024, we will start to see accelerating revenue growth and return to margin expansion. The timing of the cloud transition varies by products as some products are further along creating something of an ebb and flow in the short term headwinds and long term tailwinds. For example, for enterprise ERP our largest and most profitable product, revenue growth slowed to approximately 8.5% in 2021, and is expected to grow a approximately 8% in 2022 as the mix of new business significantly shifted to SaaS. For example, in 2019, the new business mix was 50%. Fourth quarter last year, it was over 90%. However, the early expectations are for that product's growth to accelerate around 11% in 2023, as it begins to reach the other side of this transition and experience the SaaS uplift. As we head into 2022, I am more excited than ever about Tyler's future. It's amazing to think that it took 19 years from the time we entered the government technology market in 1998 to surpass $800 million in revenues in 2017 and in 2022, we will have added the next billion dollars of revenues in just five years. In 2017, recurring revenues accounted for 63% of total revenues. In 2022, they will exceed 80% and approach $1.5 billion dollars creating long-term value. We're executing on our strategic long-term cloud transition and we have an incredible platform as the clear leader in the massive public sector market. We have reorganized and aligned our Tyler payments team with NIC's payment team to further capitalize on this opportunity. Our elevated pre-pandemic investments are paying off as our market environment is strong and our competitive position and win rates across our core applications remain extremely high. One of our biggest assets is our existing client base with over 37,000 installations across more than 12,000 locations, something that takes decades to establish, and we are poised to take advantage of cross-selling and payment opportunities to accelerate growth and expand margins as we complete our transition to the cloud. With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Matt VanVliet with BTIG. Please go ahead.\nMatt VanVliet: Yeah, thanks for taking the question guys. Appreciate it. I guess, as you look at the commentary around the additional sales activity in RFPs, do you have a sense for how much the average budget is growing for the next 12 months or kind of on a go forward basis and how much of that can you attribute to the federal stimulus money finally sort of making its way into these budgets and people ready to allocate and spend those dollars?\nLynn Moore: Yeah, I don't have the percentage growth in government budgets at my fingertips, but the backdrop is strong. I would say that one of the -- obviously in public, in the local government, one of the biggest revenue streams is property taxes. Often that accounts for more than half of their budget and generally property values remain strong, real estate markets are strong, so there's not a lot of pressure there. So the overall environmental environment backdrop is strong and I would say that doesn't really include a lot of uplift from federal stimulus yet. We've seen, handful of deals this last quarter that were specifically identified as coming from or being funded with stimulus money. There's certainly some indirect funding that may not be used directly for a Tyler purchase that relieves pressures elsewhere in the budget and frees up funds for money they'd like to spend with Tyler. But in our view, the vast majority of the stimulus money has not yet been spent or even committed yet. With the Cares Act money they have until or the American Rescue plan money they've got until the end of 2024 to spend it and I think many governments are still in the very early stages of figuring out where they're going to spend that.\nMatt VanVliet: All right. And then Brian, when we look at the, the guidance, I guess how much impact to the top line are you seeing in terms of headwinds from just the elevated SaaS mix coming through? So if we were to assume sort of the same level of mix from '21 into '22, how much of a lift would we see on that revenue number and then kind of secondarily to that, on the margin side, what is the underlying assumption for the core Tyler legacy business in terms of margin expansion, excluding some of these transition costs?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. The combination of the bubble costs, which are the incremental SaaS costs and the shift in the new mix is a combination of about $28 million to $30 million of impact on the op line on the revenue line and op related to the mix shift it's probably in the low teens, $12 million to $15 million of revenue impact from the increasing shift towards more SaaS.\nBrian Miller: Yeah. I'd say it's and that's a combination of two numbers because you've got the -- when you're just talking about new business activity, it's, more in the $17 million to $18 million hit on the short term. At the same time, we are doing flips which gets some immediate impact offsetting some maintenance loss. But if you're talking about just the new business revenue growth, it's more in the $17 million, $18 million. When you offset flips, it comes down a little bit lower but there's also a cost that's associated with flips. Typically when we do a flip, we provide some services that we don't bill and that also creates some short term pressure on the margins that will not be there in the future.\nLynn Moore: So it's that impact of the mix shift is probably about a half point of margin for the year.\nOperator: The next question is from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nPeter Heckmann: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple things, in the quarter were there any didn't sound like it, but were there any deals above $5 million in total contract value? And then in terms of, it's really encouraging to hear the cross sales so far, especially into the EGov base. I think you had done a little bit of qualification nine deals in the quarter, but is there any way to think about, quantifying the total value of bookings that Tyler may have added since the close of the EnerGov selling into current EnerGov customers?\nLynn Moore: I'll take the first part of that? No, there were not any deals this quarter that had a total contract value of more than $5 million. Our largest one was a little under $4.5 million. We had a lot of deals in the, the $1 million to $3 million range, but no, none of those mega deals this quarter and we did in the fourth quarter of last year as we pointed out.\nBrian Miller: Yeah. I think I'd add, you talking about the cross selling, that's one of our largest opportunities in our core applications and every time we do acquisitions, it's real exciting to see the things that are going on within IC right now in our other divisions. One of the things that we didn't point out in our prepared comments was a very specific deal of the nine that we talked about. And this was a deal that NIC helped using their state enterprise contracts, state contacts with the State of Arkansas where we got a vend engine deal where vend engine is going to be handling all the online and phone bank deposits in the state-wide corrections contract. That's about $800,000 in ARR and what's I think what's particularly exciting for me is NIC is a company that we acquired in April and VendEngine is a company that we acquired in September and in the first quarter those two teams got together as part, we've talked in the past about some of the efforts we were doing around sales and education, and we're able to already get a deal of this size. I think it's an example of the tip iceberg of where we can go. Not only with NIC, but all the other acquisitions that we do for strategic purposes and again, it's pretty exciting.\nPeter Heckmann: Yeah. That's incredible and it sounds as if the more near term opportunity is selling Tyler Solutions into EGov base and that might be a little easier just based upon how their portal contracts are kind of like hunting licenses but, longer term, do you see some cross sells the other way, either payments or certain applications that that NIC has developed that you might be able to sell in municipalities?\nLynn Moore: Yeah, I think, that's fair. I also, going back to the NIC strategy, I remember a year and a half ago when I was talking with the business leaders about this deal, I said, show me why this deal is good for Tyler, but also show me why Tyler's good for NIC, and I just gave the example of the vintage in Arkansas deal, but I also gave examples in my prepared remarks about how D&I really was a significant contributor in getting South Carolina in a very competitive rebid against Deloitte and also an early extension of this Texas payments contracts. So that's an example where we provided value to NIC really out of the gate. I do think as we continue, you talk about payments yes, like you look at the State of Florida, we're going to help expand that payments revenue by having that hunting license and going through our local contact. We put our payments teams together and today I generally just consider it Tyler, it's one payments organization. I don't really distinguish between NIC and Tyler anymore, but certainly they were much more mature. They were the payments leader and, and I think we're helping there as well.\nBrian Miller: And of the nine combined sell through deals this quarter, one of them was a payments deal with NIC payments with a Tyler local government client in Louisiana.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay, great. I appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question is from Terry Tillman with Truist. Please go ahead, Terry. Your line is open on our end. Is it possibly muted on yours?\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Thank you very much. This is Joe [ph] on for Terry. Thanks for taking the question. Just acknowledging that bookings can be lumpy and trillion 12 month view helps smooth things out, but I'm just curious about the bookings in 4Q, how that played out versus your expectations?\nLynn Moore: I'd say generally pretty much in line with our X expectations. One of the things, we've talked about the recovery in the market that over the last year, we've consistently talked about activity, sort of leading indicators of activity in the market. The number of RFPs we're seeing, the number of sales demos we're doing, those things continuing to rebound and trend back towards and in many cases above pre COVID levels. But you have to keep in mind that our sales cycles are long and it's not uncommon that a deal from the time that process really gets started to the time we sign a contract can be a year, year and a half. So there's a lag between a lot of the time that activity starts to, to ramp up and the time it shows up in booking. So generally we're pretty pleased. There's always some deals that fly out of the quarter, but nothing really terribly unusual this quarter. And the progress in the booking is I think in line with our expectations given that activity we've seen over the last few quarters.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Great. Thanks. And then if you could just comment on ERP demand through 2022 and how that looks going into '23. Thanks so much.\nBrian Miller: Yeah, I think the ERP demand is like everything else and across the company. I talked earlier about, demos are, are at all time, high, RFPs are up. The number of deals that we're signing particularly at our enterprise platform is approaching really pre-pandemic levels. At the lower end at our, at our ERP pro, our win rates are at all-time highs. The growth is really is really good. It has been really for, it's been good for the last several quarters and really the last year and a half or two years. So I think the demand is still pretty robust out there.\nOperator: The next question is from Charlie Strauzer with CJS Securities. Please go ahead.\nCharlie Strauzer: Hi. Good morning. Just two quick questions real quick on the AWS progress. Are you currently are you -- when you sign up a new SaaS customer, are you currently putting them on AWS? Are you still putting them on legacy systems and then migrating them over?\nLynn Moore: Yeah, that's sort of still depends a little bit by product. So new customers in our ERP side particularly in our civic and our powered by Munis, those new customers are going to be going in AWS, but you have to remember, we're still in the process of getting all of our core applications into a cloud efficient state. So, even the new customers that we sign that going to AWS, we're not going to be experiencing the higher margin that we will be, as soon as we get these products more efficient in the cloud.\nCharlie Strauzer: That makes sense and obviously we talked about some of the expenses and migration lasting it into next year. Do you think that's kind of first half of next year, full year, how should we think about the progression of that that decline of away from the,\nBrian Miller: Oh, I'd say that it's pretty consistent throughout the year. We'd expect that impact to continue on through the year.\nCharlie Strauzer: Got it. And then just lastly, Brian, I apologize if you gave us that earlier, but in the guidance any guidance for cash flow?\nBrian Miller: We do not guide the cash flow. We give a lot of in the press release. There's a lot of information around depreciation, amortization capitalization that can help you get to that number, but we don't specifically guide to cash flow.\nOperator: The next question, if from Scott Berg with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nScott Berg: Hi, everyone. Congrats on the good quarter and thanks for too my question. Lynn just to start off with a statement, you sound like you could be a CFO in your next life nice job with all those numbers there. Yeah, I guess I wanted to\u2026\nLynn Moore: I'm known for my own spread sheets, Alex.\nScott Berg: It's also impressive because I think your background as an attorney, if I remember correctly too, so double whammy there. That's fantastic. I guess wanted to start by tackling fiscal '22 margins from a slightly different angle. As we think about the fall off in NIC revenues this year, kind of the two part question, there is one, how much are NIC revenues pressuring margins this year versus the core kind of organic Tyler business, because you didn't lay that out in the slide necessarily on the website. And then secondly, as some of those COVID revenues fall off in the first half, given what those margins look like, should we get maybe a little bit of upward opportunity and margins, with a fall off of those revenues?\nLynn Moore: Yeah I'll start Scott. I think you'll see throughout the year our margin will increase some throughout the year and as we are losing some of those COVID revenues in some of the areas, I believe it's in South Carolina and Nevada our role in those COVID revenues has changed from a prime to a sub. So while those revenues drop off the margins actually get a little bit better. And so I think really at a high level NIC's contribution is somewhat consistent with Tyler's overall margin for next year.\nScott Berg: Got it helpful. And then from a sorry, go ahead Brian.\nBrian Miller: I was just going to say, yeah, the second half margins do step up from the first half as the NIC COVID revenues decline, but in general NIC's revenues or margins in 2022 are fairly close to in line with Tyler's.\nScott Berg: Got it helpful. And then from a follow up question around the SaaS transition, you all seem significantly more confident in your ability to sell that obviously today, given what your recent successes are, but Brian, I remember talking historically over the last couple years is your largest of customers still had some hesitancy to adopt a subscription model for a variety of different reasons. I think in Lynn's remarks, your expectations around Munis virtually all of those deals to go subscription this year and of course Munis is one of those products you've also had an opportunity or growing opportunity at market. Should we see those large Munis deals also go subscription this year? Or is that something that might push into, maybe '23 or '24?\nA \u2013 Brian Miller: I think we're seeing it across all tiers of the market. And that includes in the ERP space. I think last quarter 90% of Munis' deals were SaaS deals. So the upper end of the market is I think just as willing to go SaaS as the lower end and maybe in some cases more so, and we certainly had success across other products. For example, North Carolina a couple years ago in the odysey side on the courts was our biggest SaaS contract to date. And we've seen some large customers on the appraisal and tax side selecting SaaS. So I think it's across all tiers of the market.\nLynn Moore: Yeah, I think Scott, I'd add that, we've communicated to the Munis client base the direction and you're going to see more around this in, I think it's April when we have our Tyler user conference connect, you're going to see a significant, more focus on our shift to the cloud and the expectation really and the messaging is really, is that pretty much almost all new business up to that end will be going into the cloud. And as Brian mentioned, it was already over 90% in Q4 last year, which, if you go back three years ago, it had just gotten to 50-50. So it's been moving in that direction for some time.\nOperator: The next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAlex Zukin: Hey guys. So just a couple for me, I guess, help us understand, because it does feel like again, you're at a high level, you're guiding to organic revenue growth acceleration next year, and you grew organic bookings 11.5% this year outside of the headwinds, obviously from the cloud transition stuff. Put that into context and just drive home maybe if you will, A, when was the last time you guided to accelerating growth and what are some of the sustainable, trends that you're seeing in the business that give you that confidence?\nLynn Moore: Yeah, well, I think you're right. It's funny. I was, I talk sometimes in my personal life about the last couple years in COVID and sometimes I sort of call them as quote, the lost years and I try to -- I was trying to remember how things happened and I almost put everything in reference to, well, it was pre COVID or post COVID. But what I was thinking about this the other day, but at Tyler, these haven't been lost years. We've been working hard and we've been investing and we knew that this market was going to be rebounding. And we talked about it as COVID started about, we went back to the great recession and we had that great big boost out of coming outta the great recession. And we were anticipating this and we planned for it, we invested in it and at the same time made our investments into the cloud, and I think seeing the market return, yes, the stimulus money's out there. I think the local state and local government budgets are very robust. I think we're in our competitive position across all our products is an all-time high. We are at the point now where I'm starting to see the coming out of the other side of the SaaS transition. It's not happening tomorrow. It's not happening in the next couple of quarters, but my reference to what's going on at for example, up at Munis and we see the uplift that's coming from that. And so that's the stuff that gives me confidence. The acquisitions that we're doing, the cross selling that's going on, the interactions that's going on with our teams, one thing we've been focused on really a lot in the last few years is an idea that I call one Tyler and that's it's, it's not where our enterprise group and we're all together, and we're all pushing in the same direction and there's opportunities that we need to start tapping into more and more, and we're starting to see this in deals and we've done it very successfully for a long time. But as I say, our greatest assets are customer base. It doesn't take years to develop. It takes decades to develop and the opportunities we have there with our new products, as we move to SaaS, as we continue to do acquisitions things like vend engine USC direct, there's just -- there's so many opportunities out there and I just like where we sit right now, and as you can tell, I get a little excited. I think a year ago, I was talking about cautious optimism, and then I was talking about tempered excitement. And I think right now, I'm just flat out excited about the future. We're going to have a -- we're going to see some ripples for our financials over the next two years as the SaaS transition goes on, but we're making significant progress and we know where we're going to be on the other side.\nAlex Zukin: That's super helpful. I guess let's talk about my next question's about those ripples. And I apologize, it'll be a little bit of a multi-part question, but I want, when you talked about subscription revenues, ex, the COVID points being over 30%, I want to ask, if we think about this SaaS transition, what's the durability of that 30% plus subscription revenue growth? And then on the margin side, I think you guys did a wonderful job laying out the costs -- the cost hit that you're taking this year and bridging the margins on a like for like basis without it. Is this the year that margins trough in the business and then next as you absorb those bubble costs, as you absorb the comeback COVID costs, and then in '23, you start to come, go back to seeing margin leverage, or is this transition going to, kind of peg margins at this level for a few years?\nLynn Moore: I'll start, I'll let Brian jump in. I think, margins will trough may be the right word or sort of balance out at this level through 2023. And I think you'll start to see the uplift coming out of there. On your question around subscriptions and the uplift of course, embedded in our subscription line is also transaction based revenues. Those, will grow not at the same rate as some of our subscriptions, which is just coming in with our SaaS contracts. We talked about on the call, we've grown in double digits 56 quarters out of 64 quarters. We've been consistently at 20% plus. And I think as we make the transition and start coming out on the other side, I think you'll start seeing that. We talked about a few milestones in my prepared comments. One of the things that's also exciting me when I look at our mix of recurring revenue versus where it was five years ago, and you talk about our growth, it took us from 1998 to 2019 to get to a billion dollars in total revenues. And in 2022, I think we're going to do right at about a billion dollars in subscriptions alone. That's part of the excitement that I see and I see that continuing to grow at a pretty healthy clip in the near future.\nA \u2013 Brian Miller: And I would just point out that, that mid to high 30 subscription growth, it excludes the COVID related revenues, but it is not an organic number. So it also includes a full year of NIC. On organic basis, it would be more around the mid 20%, so 24%, 25% which is more consistent with I think what's sort of a sustainable in the near to midterm kind of growth in subscriptions.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you guys and congrats.\nOperator: The next question is from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nBrent Bracelin: Good morning and thank you for taking the question here. Obviously super encouraging to see government appetite to embrace cloud. I think the impact did you accelerate those transitions are very clear and well known and well understood. I wanted to double click into the cross opportunity around payments specifically around going into the existing installed base of Tyler software customers that potentially are using a different payment source and really convincing that base of customer to add on payments. Is the assertion point primarily upon a renewal. Is there a shorter sales cycle potentially to add on payments or and do you have a dedicated team now that is going in and trying to cross sell upsell existing Tyler software payments, little more color just around that opportunity. It seems like it's a very big opportunity encouraged by the nine deals. You talked about bundling those sound more like new deals. Love to get some color around being, trying to your success upselling the install base. Thanks.\nLynn Moore: No, that's a good question, Brent. I think, you actually, you asked a number of questions in there. I'll try to get to the ones I recall, if I'd missed one, just come back to at me. The sales side will vary a little bit with payments and some of that will be dependent upon the customer and payments, there's a number of things that can impact that the current providers that our clients might be using is one. But you're right. It is one of our larger opportunities and payments while we've got some great new ground with NIC and for example, the Florida contract and going locally, it's one of the focuses and emphasis, for example, we talked, there's been a lot of questions about what's going on with Munis on this call. It's considered to be one of their primary key growth drivers in the next few years is payments. And there's a significant amount of dedicated resources that are focused on that. And going back into that installed channel. So you're exactly right there. What we bring with NIC in terms of payments and our now more complete solution I think is something that's pretty important. One thing that we had really built out was electronic bill presentment and payment, and that's a very, very big differentiator in the market. And it's something that NIC was not as strong at and obviously they were very strong with their payment engine and gateway stuff, things that we needed to build. I think we've talked before where we both brought strengths here. We've got the ability through our connections with our proprietary products, either you be in tax collections, and we've got those relationships and we can start going to drive those sales. And so, you're right. It's one of our larger strategic initiatives. It's getting a lot of attention and focus. I mentioned how we just recently reorganized the internally the payments organization bringing, 45 payment org resources within Tyler and getting them aligned with the NIC resources working on go to market strategies looking at the size of the market, and so it's something that we are, I can assure you we're actively pursuing.\nBrent Bracelin: Great, super helpful color there. And just one follow up on, on the go to market for payments, is the intent that each major, it sounds like these now five solution categories would have their own dedicated payments team, or do you actually have an overlay payments sales team to go in and try to upsell cross sell?\nLynn Moore: Yeah, I think it's the latter right now. And there are certain parts of our business where payments will be a bigger focus. It obviously trickles through a lot of our different core applications. We'll be focusing on certain ones more out of the gate and as we continue to capitalize on that opportunity, we'll continue to expand.\nBrent Bracelin: Got it. Very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from [indiscernible] with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey this is Aduvaid [ph] here asking a question on behalf of Kirk. Just two questions. First I know he's been a really big year from an R&A perspective but how are you thinking about the pace of M&A going forward, and then I know you talked a little bit about the transition to AWS, but could you touch a little bit about on the just the incremental costs associated with the transition?\nLynn Moore: Sure. I'll, start, M&A is part of our history. It's something we've done since 1998. I think we've done 50 acquisitions over the 23 plus years I've been here and it's something that we continually look at. We have done a, a fair number. We did five last year. We just closed another one. Excuse me, those take significant amount of internal resources. But I think as we look forward we're going to continue to look at opportunities and when we find something compelling and that's strategic, we're going to execute on it. I mentioned last year, obviously the NIC deal and I've made my comments where there were some other deals in the pipeline. USC directs a good example. This was something that was not in the pipeline last year. We talked about a little at higher bar. I think we probably had a little bit higher bar right now. But I'm also comfortable with where we sit with our balance sheet in our debt. We paid down $395 million last year. Our net leverage is right around two give or take a little bit. So in my view, we're in a position to execute on any strategic initiative and if it's a compelling M&A opportunity we're going to do it.\nBrian Miller: And your question about the AWS transition costs, I guess what we refer to as the bubble costs or those incremental SaaS transition costs in 2022 will be in the $16 million to $18 million range. So, somewhere around 90 basis points of operating margin impact.\nOperator: The next question is from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Trevor [ph] filling in for Keith. I had a quick question about NIC. So the core revenue growth for the quarter was a little bit less than we expected. Is driver history records being impacted the slowdown in new car sales?\nBrian Miller: Yes, they are. That is the one of the bigger drivers of those revenue streams, which are a significant part of NIC's transaction revenues in many states. And one of the drivers of that is new car sales which trigger a insurance event. And so those have been affected in recent quarters by the slowness in new car sales as a result of supply chain issues.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then a quick follow up sticking with NIC you kind of touched on this a little bit earlier, but could you share the biggest success story so far and the acquisition and maybe any revenue synergies that you've achieved?\nLynn Moore: Well, I think the biggest success story, well, I could probably talk for another hour. I think the biggest success story has been bringing in their team and seeing how their team aligns with our team and seeing our teams work together, executing on our out of the gate strategy in 2021, them continuing to deliver on their business while we also sat and outlined a number of strategic initiatives which are pretty wide and diverse across Tyler. We talked about it on this call, a couple of deals that were really joint deals that we're -- that may not have happened. Or certainly the timing of it may not have happened had we not been together the vend engine deal, great example the extension of Tyler -- of Texas payments by three years because of D&I, huge success story beating in a very, very competitive rebid in South Carolina, which is a $10 million ARR client and beating out them and using Tyler and the story of Tyler and D&I involved in that. Those are all success stories, and I almost get to the point it's you're almost asking me who's my favorite kid. There's a lot of them out there.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks a lot. And congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: At this time, there appear to be no more questions. Mr. Moore, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Gary. And thanks everybody for joining us today. We hope you stay safe and healthy, and if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks everybody.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Also, we're officially launching next week our new brand architecture, a broad company initiative that better organizes the name Tyler' Products and Solutions to represent the verticals and markets we serve. The new brand architecture uses functional descriptive product names and has eliminated all individual product logos. Tyler Solutions have been organized under five solution portfolios, public administration, health and human services, courts and public safety, schools and transformative technology. Throughout the call today, we'll refer to product and solution names using the new architecture. Lynn? Thanks Lynn yesterday. Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we've belief facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the financial reports GAAP, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $433.5 million up 53% with the inclusion of NIC and our other acquisitions. Non-GAAP revenues were $434.2 million up 53.2%. On an organic basis GAAP and non-GAAP revenues both grew 9.2%. Software licenses and services grew 21.1% or 4.6% excluding NIC. Subscription revenues rose 144.1%. Excluding the contribution from NIC, subscription revenues were still very strong growing 28.1%. We added 135 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 71 existing on-premises clients representing approximately $74 million in total contract value. In Q4 of last year, we added 118 new subscription based arrangements and 50 on-premises conversions representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the fourth quarter added $14.8 million in new annual recurring revenue. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 77% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 73% in Q4 of last year, reflecting in our ongoing shift to a cloud first approach to sales and increasing client preferences for cloud based solutions. The valuated average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.9 years compared to 3.5 last year. Transaction based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions were $137.1 million up almost fivefold from last year. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $17.6 million up 13.4%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 14%. For the fourth quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue or ARR was approximately $1.4 billion up 63.7%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements for Q4 was approximately $372 million up 34%. Transaction based ARR was approximately $548 million up 458% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was down slightly at approximately $471 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.8 billion up 12.6%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction based, their backlog at quarter end was only $24 million. Excluding the addition of N I Tyler's backlog grew 11.1%. Our bookings in the quarter were robust at $464 million up 39.3%, including the transaction based revenues of NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were approximately $347 million up 4.2%. As a reminder, bookings in the fourth quarter of 2020 included a large contract for tax software and appraisal services valued at approximately only $18 million making for a tough bookings comparison. For the year, bookings were approximately $1.8 billion up 41.6% and on an organic basis, were approximately $1.4 billion up 11.7%. Our business continues to generate cash at a high level and for the fourth quarter, cash from operations grew almost 30% and free cash flow grew 13.7% to $95.1 million. Our balance sheet also remains very strong. During the quarter, we repaid $87.5 million for our term debt and since the NIC acquisition, we've repaid $395 million of debt. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.34 billion and cash in investments of $407.8 million and net leverage of approximately 2.07 times, trailing 12 months, pro forma EBITDA. Turning to 2022, our focus continues to be on our strategic activities around our cloud transition on several fronts. Although this creates some short term pressure on revenue, growth and margins that Lynn will discuss in more detail, we believe the acceleration of this strategy is creating significant long term value for shareholders and clients. Our 2022 annual guidance reflects the impact of these strategic activities and is as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.83 billion and $1.87 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 9.5%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $36 million of COVID related revenues from NIC's tour health and pandemic rent relief services. The tour health revenues are expected to continue through the first half of 2022 while revenues from the rent relief program are expected to continue throughout the year. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be be between $4.09 and $4.26, and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.41 and $7.58. To provide a little more color on our revenue guidance, we expect that our license revenues will decline in the mid-single digits in 2022, while subscription revenues will grow 25% to 30%. Excluding COVID related revenues, subscriptions are expected to grow in the mid to high thirties. Maintenance will be flat to down low single digits, software services, appraisal services and hardware and other revenues are each expected to grow in the low to mid-teens. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn. Yeah. I'd say it's and that's a combination of two numbers because you've got the -- when you're just talking about new business activity, it's, more in the $17 million to $18 million hit on the short term. At the same time, we are doing flips which gets some immediate impact offsetting some maintenance loss. But if you're talking about just the new business revenue growth, it's more in the $17 million, $18 million. When you offset flips, it comes down a little bit lower but there's also a cost that's associated with flips. Typically when we do a flip, we provide some services that we don't bill and that also creates some short term pressure on the margins that will not be there in the future. Yeah. I think I'd add, you talking about the cross selling, that's one of our largest opportunities in our core applications and every time we do acquisitions, it's real exciting to see the things that are going on within IC right now in our other divisions. One of the things that we didn't point out in our prepared comments was a very specific deal of the nine that we talked about. And this was a deal that NIC helped using their state enterprise contracts, state contacts with the State of Arkansas where we got a vend engine deal where vend engine is going to be handling all the online and phone bank deposits in the state-wide corrections contract. That's about $800,000 in ARR and what's I think what's particularly exciting for me is NIC is a company that we acquired in April and VendEngine is a company that we acquired in September and in the first quarter those two teams got together as part, we've talked in the past about some of the efforts we were doing around sales and education, and we're able to already get a deal of this size. I think it's an example of the tip iceberg of where we can go. Not only with NIC, but all the other acquisitions that we do for strategic purposes and again, it's pretty exciting. And of the nine combined sell through deals this quarter, one of them was a payments deal with NIC payments with a Tyler local government client in Louisiana. Yeah, I think the ERP demand is like everything else and across the company. I talked earlier about, demos are, are at all time, high, RFPs are up. The number of deals that we're signing particularly at our enterprise platform is approaching really pre-pandemic levels. At the lower end at our, at our ERP pro, our win rates are at all-time highs. The growth is really is really good. It has been really for, it's been good for the last several quarters and really the last year and a half or two years. So I think the demand is still pretty robust out there. Oh, I'd say that it's pretty consistent throughout the year. We'd expect that impact to continue on through the year. We do not guide the cash flow. We give a lot of in the press release. There's a lot of information around depreciation, amortization capitalization that can help you get to that number, but we don't specifically guide to cash flow. I was just going to say, yeah, the second half margins do step up from the first half as the NIC COVID revenues decline, but in general NIC's revenues or margins in 2022 are fairly close to in line with Tyler's. And your question about the AWS transition costs, I guess what we refer to as the bubble costs or those incremental SaaS transition costs in 2022 will be in the $16 million to $18 million range. So, somewhere around 90 basis points of operating margin impact. Yes, they are. That is the one of the bigger drivers of those revenue streams, which are a significant part of NIC's transaction revenues in many states. And one of the drivers of that is new car sales which trigger a insurance event. And so those have been affected in recent quarters by the slowness in new car sales as a result of supply chain issues."

            "name": "Lynn Moore",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary, and welcome to our call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I'll have some comments on our quarter and then Brian will review the details of our results. I'll end with some additional comments on 2021 and our longer term outlook and then we'll take questions. Brian? Thanks Brian. Our fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations and continue to the positive momentum from the first three quarters to provide a strong finish to 2021. We're pleased that revenue growth continue to rebound, even as we experience revenue headwinds from the accelerating shift of new business to our SaaS model. Total revenues grew 53% with solid organic growth increasing to 9.2%. NIC continued its strong performance in the fourth quarter as well with core revenue growth of 7.5% excluding COVID related revenues. As expected, COVID related revenues declined sequentially from the third quarter of 2021 and were slightly above our plan at $16.6 million as the Omicron variant increased demand for testing in December and revenues from our new initiative supporting rent relief programs in Virginia came online. Recurring revenues comprised over 80% of our quarterly revenues for the second consecutive quarter and were led by 144% growth in subscription revenues. Excluding NIC revenues, subscription revenue growth was robust at 28.1% again, reflecting our accelerating shift to the cloud. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 56 of the last 64 quarters. We continue to experience pressure on margins in Q4, as we have throughout the year as a result of several factors. Some low margin revenues such as billable travel that declined substantially in 2020 due to the pandemic began to return in 2021. In addition, some expenses that also declined in 2020 have also started to return including business travel, trade shows and employee health costs. Margins have also been impacted by the inclusion of NIC including their lower margin gross payments contracts and COVID initiative revenues. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 330 basis points to 23.6%. And while our accelerating move to the cloud continues to build long term value, the increase in the SaaS mix of new business also weighed on our fourth quarter margins as SaaS accounted for 77% of our new contract volume in the quarter versus 73% last year. We continue to be very pleased with NIC's performance in the market and with the growing pipeline of joint opportunities for Tyler and NIC. During the fourth quarter NIC was successful in competitive rebids for enterprise contracts in South Carolina and Indiana payments and with renewals or extensions of enterprise agreements in Mississippi, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii and Texas Payments. We believe that Tyler's acquisition of NIC was a positive factor in the extension of these client relationships in particular, the inclusion of our enterprise data platform powered by Socrata was a material differentiator in the successful competitive rebid for South Carolina. We had nine combined sell through wins in the quarter where Tyler products were sold through NIC state enterprise contracts, or with influence from NIC state teams. These wins contained a number of Tyler products and services, including our enterprise data platform powered by Socrata, case management development platform powered by IntelliTrack, VendEngine, and NIC payments and generated over $1 million in new ARR for Tyler. We also continue to experience increased cross-selling opportunities across Tyler's product suites, especially for our enterprise data platform and our two largest new SaaS deals in the fourth quarter were examples. The first deal was with the city of Lawrence, Kansas valued at approximately $4.3 million and the second was with the city of Hammond, Indiana valued at approximately $3.8 million. Both new contracts included our enterprise ERP powered by Munis, enterprise permitting and licensing powered by EnerGov and enterprise data platform powered by Socrata Solutions among others. In addition, we signed a new combination license and SaaS deal with the Colorado division of Real Estate valued at nearly $1 million for our case management and development platform and enterprise data platform solutions, as well as NIC's electronic payment solution. This is also a great example of not only our ability to add value by offering multiple Tyler solutions in a single deal, but also the ability to win follow-on deals with various agencies. As you recall, in Q2 of 2021, we signed a $9.3 million contract with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies, Division of Professions and Occupations for similar products, which paved the way for this deal with the division of real estate. Other significant new SaaS operations signed this quarter each with a total contract value of greater than $2 million included the City of Camas, Washington for enterprise ERP and Enterprise Permitting and Licensing Solutions, Baton Rouge, Louisiana for Enterprise Justice and Supervision Solutions powered by Odyssey, the City of Taunton, Massachusetts for our enterprise ERP solution, Caldwell County, Texas for our Enterprise Justice and Jury Solutions and the City of Snoqualmie, Washington for our enterprise ERP solution. For our premise license contracts, notable new signings included the Lee County Clerk of the Courts and Comptroller in Florida valued at approximately $2.9 million and the City of Woodland, California valued at approximately $1.4 million for our enterprise ERP solution and the cities of Colorado Springs, Colorado and Salem, Oregon for our enterprise public safety solutions valued at approximately $2.4 million and $1.4 million respectively. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our guidance on 2022. Thanks, Brian. I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter results, especially with regard to our sales and revenue performance. Activity in the public sector market continues to trend positively with indicators such as RFP and demo activity generally at or above pre-COVID levels. It's also gratifying that our NIC operations are executing at a high level, and that we're seeing early successes in achieving the go to market objectives we envisioned around the acquisition. For example, NIC was recently awarded an early three year extension to its Texas Payments contract at existing rates. Similar to the South Carolina rebid, the inclusion of Tyler's enterprise data platform and in particular payment insights with fraud detection and prevention proved to be a major factor in obtaining this early extension. We're very excited to expand NIC's portfolio of software solutions with the acquisition of USC Direct, which we completed last week. USC Direct has a market leading AWS cloud hosted outdoor reservation platform for the fast growing campground and outdoor recreation management market, which complements our existing strength in the hunting and fishing license market. This combination will allow us to create a very competitive all in one outdoor solution, addressing an estimated $2 million market while also expanding our payments opportunity. USC Direct is now a part of our NIC division, and we welcome their 60 team members to Tyler. Now I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our accelerator move to the cloud, including the expected impact on our results in both the near term and the long term. As most of you know, we have operated in a hybrid model for many years, offering our core products in either an on-premises model with an upfront license and annual maintenance or a SaaS model with a software generally hosted in a Tyler data center and a multiyear subscription revenue stream. Since our first SaaS client Eau Claire [ph] Wisconsin chose Tyler in 2000. The mix of clients choosing our SaaS model grew slowly but steadily as we pursued a cloud agnostic approach to sales and let the market decide the pace at which it would move to the cloud. And as with many things in the public sector, our market has moved to the cloud more slowly than the private sector. In fact, it took until 2019 for the majority of our new business to come to us in the cloud a year in which we also recognize an all-time high $100.2 million in license revenues. 2019 was also the year in which we made the strategic decision to shift our future model from a cloud agnostic approach to a cloud first approach. In conjunction with that shift, we entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Amazon web services and embarked on significant development efforts to optimize our key products, to be efficiently deployed in the cloud through AWS, with an ultimate goal of exiting our two proprietary data centers and eventually deploying all of our SaaS clients in the public cloud. Over the past two years, we've made substantial progress under our cloud first approach. I'm pleased to report that we remain on target with our product development initiatives with an expectation that all of our major products will be cloud efficient or cloud optimized by the end of 2023 or early 2024. In addition, almost every product we've added through acquisition in the last several years has been cloud native. We've begun deploying some new SaaS clients in AWS, as well as lifting and shifting a limited number of existing SaaS clients out of our data centers and into AWS. We've made changes to sales compensation to encourage cloud sales over licenses. In early 2021, we also created a new cloud strategy and operations team, which has responsibility for our overall cloud transformation strategy and operations, including things like defining best practices for cloud development, operations, and deployment to achieve the full value of our cloud initiative. And as we've embraced the cloud first approach, our market has also continued to embrace the cloud at an increasing rate. In 2021, 71% of our new soft contract value came to us in the cloud with that percentage reaching 77% in the fourth quarter and conversions of existing on-premises clients of the cloud have also reached new highs in each of the last three quarters. So clearly our shift to the cloud is in sync with the market as clients recognize the many benefits of cloud based solutions. This acceleration of our cloud transition is continuing as we move into 2022. Effective January 1, 2022, some of our major products, including enterprise ERP powered by Munis and enterprise permitting and licensing powered by EnerGov will almost exclusively be offered to new clients as cloud solutions. Other applications will follow. We expect that the percentage of new clients choosing the cloud model will continue to grow significantly in 2022, with the exception of public safety. With today, there has been more market reluctance to move systems to the cloud. The general impacts of a SaaS transition on a software company financial model are generally understood. From a revenue perspective, there's an initial headwind as licensed revenue that is generally recognized up front is replaced by a recurring subscription revenue stream. And unlike licenses, that recurring revenue stream is not recognized in full immediately. Rather revenue recognition typically begins when customers go live with particular models, which can take several quarters. However, because the annual recurring revenues from a subscription client are approximately 1.8 to two times the annual maintenance, the same client would generate in a license deal, the SaaS revenue stream is significantly higher over the life of a client. Some extent we have experienced this headwind for several years, but the impact is increasing as the shift accelerates. Over the next several years, as Brian mentioned, license and maintenance revenue will continue to decline while subscriptions will accelerate. For example, in 2019 maintenance revenues were 45% higher than subscriptions. In 2022, subscriptions will surpass maintenance revenues. From a margin perspective, there are multiple short-term headwinds as well. License revenues have very high margins with immediate impact and as they decline, margins are negatively impacted until the subscription revenue stream reaches the point where it offsets those lost licenses. In addition, we will experience some margin headwood from bubble costs around the transition from our internal data centers to the AWS hosting environment. We can currently host almost all of our more than 5400 SaaS clients in one of two main proprietary data centers. We have certain fixed costs associated with running those data centers, even as we transition the hosting of new and existing clients to AWS. Until we completely exit one and ultimately both of our data centers, we will incur some duplicative costs that put pressure on margins. Once we are in AWS with products that are architected to operate more efficiently in the public cloud, we will see an uplift in margins. With that backdrop, I'd like to turn to a closer look at our outlook for 2022 and beyond. Our revenue growth outlook is solid representing the continuing return to and growth over pre pandemic levels and our increasing competitive position. The midpoint of our guidance would represent approximately 16% total growth and 9.5% organic growth, even in light of the continued accelerated shift of new business to SaaS. We expect that approximately 80% of our new software contract mix in 2022 will be SaaS. From a margin perspective, the midpoint of our 2022 guidance implies non-GAAP operating margin contraction of approximately 160 basis points. That said, our implied 2022 non-GAAP operating margin is consistent with or even slightly higher than our 2021 Q4 operating margin as the major factors impacting margins began before this year. I'd like to break down a few of those factors. The first material category of margin pressures we consider to be part of our long term strategy of becoming a cloud first company, the impact of the year over year increase in our SaaS business mix, net of on-premises conversions, along with increasing bubble cost in 2022 will negatively impact operating profit by approximately $28 million to $30 million. The second significant category of factors causing margin pressure is made up of costs and low margin revenues that experience reductions during the pandemic, but have been slowly returning since the end of last year, in which we've discussed on prior calls. These include trade shows, sales related travel costs, and some billable travel. Importantly, some costs have not, and will not return to pre COVID levels. The third category of factors include some one time or non-discretionary costs. We like virtually every company are experiencing the effects of labor market disruptions and increased wage pressure and healthcare costs also continue to rise as a result of healthcare inflation combined with the catch up of expenses from healthcare that were deferred during the pandemic. We've posted on our website with a supplemental quarterly data, a summary of these margin challenges. The estimated total impact of all these items accounts for approximately 290 basis points of operating margin impact in our 2022 outlook. Looking beyond 2022, we expect that our margins will continue to be impacted by some of these factors, particularly declining license revenues and cloud transition bubble costs. We believe that operating margin pressures from the cloud transition will bottom out in 2023 and that beginning in 2024, we will start to see accelerating revenue growth and return to margin expansion. The timing of the cloud transition varies by products as some products are further along creating something of an ebb and flow in the short term headwinds and long term tailwinds. For example, for enterprise ERP our largest and most profitable product, revenue growth slowed to approximately 8.5% in 2021, and is expected to grow a approximately 8% in 2022 as the mix of new business significantly shifted to SaaS. For example, in 2019, the new business mix was 50%. Fourth quarter last year, it was over 90%. However, the early expectations are for that product's growth to accelerate around 11% in 2023, as it begins to reach the other side of this transition and experience the SaaS uplift. As we head into 2022, I am more excited than ever about Tyler's future. It's amazing to think that it took 19 years from the time we entered the government technology market in 1998 to surpass $800 million in revenues in 2017 and in 2022, we will have added the next billion dollars of revenues in just five years. In 2017, recurring revenues accounted for 63% of total revenues. In 2022, they will exceed 80% and approach $1.5 billion dollars creating long-term value. We're executing on our strategic long-term cloud transition and we have an incredible platform as the clear leader in the massive public sector market. We have reorganized and aligned our Tyler payments team with NIC's payment team to further capitalize on this opportunity. Our elevated pre-pandemic investments are paying off as our market environment is strong and our competitive position and win rates across our core applications remain extremely high. One of our biggest assets is our existing client base with over 37,000 installations across more than 12,000 locations, something that takes decades to establish, and we are poised to take advantage of cross-selling and payment opportunities to accelerate growth and expand margins as we complete our transition to the cloud. With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A. Yeah, I don't have the percentage growth in government budgets at my fingertips, but the backdrop is strong. I would say that one of the -- obviously in public, in the local government, one of the biggest revenue streams is property taxes. Often that accounts for more than half of their budget and generally property values remain strong, real estate markets are strong, so there's not a lot of pressure there. So the overall environmental environment backdrop is strong and I would say that doesn't really include a lot of uplift from federal stimulus yet. We've seen, handful of deals this last quarter that were specifically identified as coming from or being funded with stimulus money. There's certainly some indirect funding that may not be used directly for a Tyler purchase that relieves pressures elsewhere in the budget and frees up funds for money they'd like to spend with Tyler. But in our view, the vast majority of the stimulus money has not yet been spent or even committed yet. With the Cares Act money they have until or the American Rescue plan money they've got until the end of 2024 to spend it and I think many governments are still in the very early stages of figuring out where they're going to spend that. Yeah. The combination of the bubble costs, which are the incremental SaaS costs and the shift in the new mix is a combination of about $28 million to $30 million of impact on the op line on the revenue line and op related to the mix shift it's probably in the low teens, $12 million to $15 million of revenue impact from the increasing shift towards more SaaS. So it's that impact of the mix shift is probably about a half point of margin for the year. I'll take the first part of that? No, there were not any deals this quarter that had a total contract value of more than $5 million. Our largest one was a little under $4.5 million. We had a lot of deals in the, the $1 million to $3 million range, but no, none of those mega deals this quarter and we did in the fourth quarter of last year as we pointed out. Yeah, I think, that's fair. I also, going back to the NIC strategy, I remember a year and a half ago when I was talking with the business leaders about this deal, I said, show me why this deal is good for Tyler, but also show me why Tyler's good for NIC, and I just gave the example of the vintage in Arkansas deal, but I also gave examples in my prepared remarks about how D&I really was a significant contributor in getting South Carolina in a very competitive rebid against Deloitte and also an early extension of this Texas payments contracts. So that's an example where we provided value to NIC really out of the gate. I do think as we continue, you talk about payments yes, like you look at the State of Florida, we're going to help expand that payments revenue by having that hunting license and going through our local contact. We put our payments teams together and today I generally just consider it Tyler, it's one payments organization. I don't really distinguish between NIC and Tyler anymore, but certainly they were much more mature. They were the payments leader and, and I think we're helping there as well. I'd say generally pretty much in line with our X expectations. One of the things, we've talked about the recovery in the market that over the last year, we've consistently talked about activity, sort of leading indicators of activity in the market. The number of RFPs we're seeing, the number of sales demos we're doing, those things continuing to rebound and trend back towards and in many cases above pre COVID levels. But you have to keep in mind that our sales cycles are long and it's not uncommon that a deal from the time that process really gets started to the time we sign a contract can be a year, year and a half. So there's a lag between a lot of the time that activity starts to, to ramp up and the time it shows up in booking. So generally we're pretty pleased. There's always some deals that fly out of the quarter, but nothing really terribly unusual this quarter. And the progress in the booking is I think in line with our expectations given that activity we've seen over the last few quarters. Yeah, that's sort of still depends a little bit by product. So new customers in our ERP side particularly in our civic and our powered by Munis, those new customers are going to be going in AWS, but you have to remember, we're still in the process of getting all of our core applications into a cloud efficient state. So, even the new customers that we sign that going to AWS, we're not going to be experiencing the higher margin that we will be, as soon as we get these products more efficient in the cloud. I'm known for my own spread sheets, Alex. Yeah I'll start Scott. I think you'll see throughout the year our margin will increase some throughout the year and as we are losing some of those COVID revenues in some of the areas, I believe it's in South Carolina and Nevada our role in those COVID revenues has changed from a prime to a sub. So while those revenues drop off the margins actually get a little bit better. And so I think really at a high level NIC's contribution is somewhat consistent with Tyler's overall margin for next year. Yeah, I think Scott, I'd add that, we've communicated to the Munis client base the direction and you're going to see more around this in, I think it's April when we have our Tyler user conference connect, you're going to see a significant, more focus on our shift to the cloud and the expectation really and the messaging is really, is that pretty much almost all new business up to that end will be going into the cloud. And as Brian mentioned, it was already over 90% in Q4 last year, which, if you go back three years ago, it had just gotten to 50-50. So it's been moving in that direction for some time. Yeah, well, I think you're right. It's funny. I was, I talk sometimes in my personal life about the last couple years in COVID and sometimes I sort of call them as quote, the lost years and I try to -- I was trying to remember how things happened and I almost put everything in reference to, well, it was pre COVID or post COVID. But what I was thinking about this the other day, but at Tyler, these haven't been lost years. We've been working hard and we've been investing and we knew that this market was going to be rebounding. And we talked about it as COVID started about, we went back to the great recession and we had that great big boost out of coming outta the great recession. And we were anticipating this and we planned for it, we invested in it and at the same time made our investments into the cloud, and I think seeing the market return, yes, the stimulus money's out there. I think the local state and local government budgets are very robust. I think we're in our competitive position across all our products is an all-time high. We are at the point now where I'm starting to see the coming out of the other side of the SaaS transition. It's not happening tomorrow. It's not happening in the next couple of quarters, but my reference to what's going on at for example, up at Munis and we see the uplift that's coming from that. And so that's the stuff that gives me confidence. The acquisitions that we're doing, the cross selling that's going on, the interactions that's going on with our teams, one thing we've been focused on really a lot in the last few years is an idea that I call one Tyler and that's it's, it's not where our enterprise group and we're all together, and we're all pushing in the same direction and there's opportunities that we need to start tapping into more and more, and we're starting to see this in deals and we've done it very successfully for a long time. But as I say, our greatest assets are customer base. It doesn't take years to develop. It takes decades to develop and the opportunities we have there with our new products, as we move to SaaS, as we continue to do acquisitions things like vend engine USC direct, there's just -- there's so many opportunities out there and I just like where we sit right now, and as you can tell, I get a little excited. I think a year ago, I was talking about cautious optimism, and then I was talking about tempered excitement. And I think right now, I'm just flat out excited about the future. We're going to have a -- we're going to see some ripples for our financials over the next two years as the SaaS transition goes on, but we're making significant progress and we know where we're going to be on the other side. I'll start, I'll let Brian jump in. I think, margins will trough may be the right word or sort of balance out at this level through 2023. And I think you'll start to see the uplift coming out of there. On your question around subscriptions and the uplift of course, embedded in our subscription line is also transaction based revenues. Those, will grow not at the same rate as some of our subscriptions, which is just coming in with our SaaS contracts. We talked about on the call, we've grown in double digits 56 quarters out of 64 quarters. We've been consistently at 20% plus. And I think as we make the transition and start coming out on the other side, I think you'll start seeing that. We talked about a few milestones in my prepared comments. One of the things that's also exciting me when I look at our mix of recurring revenue versus where it was five years ago, and you talk about our growth, it took us from 1998 to 2019 to get to a billion dollars in total revenues. And in 2022, I think we're going to do right at about a billion dollars in subscriptions alone. That's part of the excitement that I see and I see that continuing to grow at a pretty healthy clip in the near future.\nA \u2013 Brian Miller: And I would just point out that, that mid to high 30 subscription growth, it excludes the COVID related revenues, but it is not an organic number. So it also includes a full year of NIC. On organic basis, it would be more around the mid 20%, so 24%, 25% which is more consistent with I think what's sort of a sustainable in the near to midterm kind of growth in subscriptions. No, that's a good question, Brent. I think, you actually, you asked a number of questions in there. I'll try to get to the ones I recall, if I'd missed one, just come back to at me. The sales side will vary a little bit with payments and some of that will be dependent upon the customer and payments, there's a number of things that can impact that the current providers that our clients might be using is one. But you're right. It is one of our larger opportunities and payments while we've got some great new ground with NIC and for example, the Florida contract and going locally, it's one of the focuses and emphasis, for example, we talked, there's been a lot of questions about what's going on with Munis on this call. It's considered to be one of their primary key growth drivers in the next few years is payments. And there's a significant amount of dedicated resources that are focused on that. And going back into that installed channel. So you're exactly right there. What we bring with NIC in terms of payments and our now more complete solution I think is something that's pretty important. One thing that we had really built out was electronic bill presentment and payment, and that's a very, very big differentiator in the market. And it's something that NIC was not as strong at and obviously they were very strong with their payment engine and gateway stuff, things that we needed to build. I think we've talked before where we both brought strengths here. We've got the ability through our connections with our proprietary products, either you be in tax collections, and we've got those relationships and we can start going to drive those sales. And so, you're right. It's one of our larger strategic initiatives. It's getting a lot of attention and focus. I mentioned how we just recently reorganized the internally the payments organization bringing, 45 payment org resources within Tyler and getting them aligned with the NIC resources working on go to market strategies looking at the size of the market, and so it's something that we are, I can assure you we're actively pursuing. Yeah, I think it's the latter right now. And there are certain parts of our business where payments will be a bigger focus. It obviously trickles through a lot of our different core applications. We'll be focusing on certain ones more out of the gate and as we continue to capitalize on that opportunity, we'll continue to expand. Sure. I'll, start, M&A is part of our history. It's something we've done since 1998. I think we've done 50 acquisitions over the 23 plus years I've been here and it's something that we continually look at. We have done a, a fair number. We did five last year. We just closed another one. Excuse me, those take significant amount of internal resources. But I think as we look forward we're going to continue to look at opportunities and when we find something compelling and that's strategic, we're going to execute on it. I mentioned last year, obviously the NIC deal and I've made my comments where there were some other deals in the pipeline. USC directs a good example. This was something that was not in the pipeline last year. We talked about a little at higher bar. I think we probably had a little bit higher bar right now. But I'm also comfortable with where we sit with our balance sheet in our debt. We paid down $395 million last year. Our net leverage is right around two give or take a little bit. So in my view, we're in a position to execute on any strategic initiative and if it's a compelling M&A opportunity we're going to do it. Well, I think the biggest success story, well, I could probably talk for another hour. I think the biggest success story has been bringing in their team and seeing how their team aligns with our team and seeing our teams work together, executing on our out of the gate strategy in 2021, them continuing to deliver on their business while we also sat and outlined a number of strategic initiatives which are pretty wide and diverse across Tyler. We talked about it on this call, a couple of deals that were really joint deals that we're -- that may not have happened. Or certainly the timing of it may not have happened had we not been together the vend engine deal, great example the extension of Tyler -- of Texas payments by three years because of D&I, huge success story beating in a very, very competitive rebid in South Carolina, which is a $10 million ARR client and beating out them and using Tyler and the story of Tyler and D&I involved in that. Those are all success stories, and I almost get to the point it's you're almost asking me who's my favorite kid. There's a lot of them out there. Thanks, Gary. And thanks everybody for joining us today. We hope you stay safe and healthy, and if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks everybody."

Your host for today\u2019s call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, October 28, 2021. Lynn Moore, please go ahead.\nLynn Moore: Thank you, Jason, and welcome to our call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I\u2019d like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I\u2019ll have some comments on our quarter and then Brian will review the details of our results. I\u2019ll end with some additional comments and then we\u2019ll take questions. Brian?\nBrian Miller: Thanks, Lynn.

Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. Our third quarter results were exceptionally strong, building on the momentum we established in the first half of the year. This was our first full quarter including NICs results and it was our best quarter ever by most financial measures. We achieved new quarterly highs and revenues, non-GAAP EPS, free cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, bookings and backlog. Total revenues grew 60.9%, with organic growth of 7.6%. As a result of the surge in the Delta variant, NIC\u2019s COVID-19 related revenues from TourHealth and Pandemic Unemployment initiatives were significantly above plan at $43.3 million. We had expected those revenues which have relatively low margins to wind down in the second half of the year. But we now expect they will continue into the first half of 2022. NIC\u2019s core revenues grew 5% in the quarter. Recurring revenues comprised over 80% of our quarterly revenues for the first time and were led by 183% growth in subscription revenues. Excluding NIC revenues, subscription revenue growth was robust at 23.9%, reflecting our accelerating shift to the cloud. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 55 quarters of the last 63 quarters. Software licenses and services revenues grew 13.9% or 2% excluding NIC. As expected, our margins compressed compared to last year third quarter. Some expenses like tradeshows and employee health claims, as well as lower margin revenues like billable travel that declined in 2020 due to COVID pandemic have begun to return this year. Margins were also impacted by the inclusion of NIC and particularly by the continuation of their lower margin COVID initiative revenues. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 330 basis points to 25.3%. Excluding NICs COVID initiative revenues and related costs, our non-GAAP operating margin was 26.8%. Bookings reached a record high in third quarter at approximately $601 million, more than double last year third quarter. Excluding NIC, bookings grew 51.9%, with the biggest contributor being the $63 million renewal of our fixed fee e-filing arrangement with the State of Illinois. We\u2019re very pleased to report early success this quarter with joint sales efforts between NIC and Tyler Solutions teams. We signed agreements with the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development valued at approximately $24 million to provide a digital and call center solution for tenant, landlord and third-party filing of Rent Relief Program claims. We will also provide Administrative Dashboards from our Socrata Data & Insight solutions, as well as payment processing capabilities. Our largest software deal the quarter also came from NIC with $6.1 million SaaS contract with the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles for digital titling. This new digital vehicle titling and registration management system will go beyond modernization and revolutionize how the DMV manages vehicles and interacts with businesses and citizens. In addition to the streamlining of nearly every vehicle related process in place today, many legacy paper processes will be fully replaced with secure digital solutions. The solution utilizes technology to govern and secure the vehicle ownership process, adding security, reducing fraud and providing the flexibility that other state DMVs operations are lacking. The arrangement, which leverages our State Master Agreement has an initial term of five years. In addition to the SaaS fees, the agreement will generate estimated transaction revenue of more than $3 million per year. I\u2019d like to also highlight a few more significant deals sign this quarter. We signed Appraisal Services contracts with the Delaware counties of Newcastle and Kent. In addition, Newcastle County selected our iasWorld Appraisal Solution under a SaaS arrangement. The deals have a combined value of approximately $19 million. Coupled with the Appraisal Services contract signed last quarter with Sussex County. Tyler will now be performing a property reassessment for the entire state. Also for our iasWorld Property Tax and Appraisal Solution, we signed SaaS arrangements with the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo in Alberta, Canada, valued at approximately $3.1 million. Franklin County, Ohio valued at approximately $3.5 million and Summit County, Ohio, which also includes our Data & Insights Solution, valued at approximately $2.9 million. Other major SaaS deals included a $4.5 million contract with Arlington Heights, Illinois for our ERP Civic Services and Payment Solutions, and a $3.4 million contract with Bayer County, Texas for our Odyssey, SoftCode and Supervision Justice Solutions. Our largest perpetual license contract of the quarter was a $5.4 million contract to provide our MicroPact Entellitrak Solution to manage COVID vaccination adaptations for the U.S. Department of Justice. We also signed a $2.5 million on-premises license contract with the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands for our Munis ERP and Enterprise Asset Management, ExecuTime and Socrata Solutions. We also signed several significant contract renewals with existing clients, including extensions of NIC\u2019s State Enterprise Agreements with the States of Utah and Oklahoma, and a five-year renewal of our e-filing arrangement with the State of Illinois, which was expanded to include applications from our Socrata Data & Insights platform. On last quarter\u2019s call, we reported that NIC had been selected as one of two vendors to provide the Internal Revenue Service with a Digital Payment Processing Solution that would allow taxpayers to securely pay their federal taxes and that revenue under that contract was expected to begin in January of 2022. Following the award, three entities filed protests with the GAO. Prior to any ruling on the protest by the GAO, the IRS notified the GAO that it was canceling the two awards, including the award to NIC. While the IRS has not formally terminated NIC\u2019s contract, it has issued a stop work order under the contract. The IRS indicated that it will either amend the current solicitation, allowing all bidders to modify their previous submissions and then reevaluate the proposals or terminate the existing solicitation and start the process over with a new procurement in the coming months. The IRS has not yet stated which of these options it will select and we have no information regarding the potential timing of either option. Given these recent developments, we do not expect to recognize any revenue under the IRS award in 2022. While the specific concerns raised in the protests have not been made public and are not known by Tyler, the decision to cancel the award to NIC was not related to NIC\u2019s performance under the contract, its ability to successfully perform under the contract or any allegations of misconduct or improper behavior by NIC. On the M&A front, we completed the acquisitions of VendEngine and Arx during the third quarter. VendEngine is one of the fastest growing technology companies in North America, operating in more than 230 counties and 32 states. Its leading cloud-based platform provides a comprehensive suite of applications focused on the corrections market, including deposit technologies for commissary, ordering and warehouse management, and various informational electronic communications, security, accounting and financial trust management components. Arx is a cloud-based software platform which creates accessible technology to enable a modern day police force that is fully transparent, accountable and a trusted resource to the community it serves. The acquisition of Arx allows Tyler to offer a full suite of Public Safety Solutions, including Arx Alert and Arx Community, designed to maximize efficiency and safety for law enforcement officers, while increasing transparency and trust building with communities. VendEngine and Arx have combined ARR of approximately $17.5 million and their additions further strengthened Tyler\u2019s justice and Public Safety suites. Now, I\u2019d like for Brian to provide more details on results of the quarter.\nBrian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021. In our earnings release, we\u2019ve included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We\u2019ve also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provides on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $459.9 million, up 60.9%. Non-GAAP revenues were $460.6 million, up 61.1%. On an organic basis GAAP and non-GAAP revenues grew 7.6% and 7.5%, respectively. Software license revenues rose 13.7%. Subscription revenues rose 183.3%. Excluding the contribution from NIC subscription revenues were still very strong, growing 23.9%. We added 144 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 67 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $84 million in total contract value. In Q3 of last year, we added 114 new subscription-based arrangements and had 46 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $56 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 74% of total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 47% in Q3 of last year, reflecting our ongoing shift to a cloud first approach to sales. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.4 years, compared to 4.3 years last year. Transaction based revenues which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions were $171.2 million, up more than six-fold from last year. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $17.4 million, up to 15%. Excluding NIC, Tyler\u2019s transaction-based revenues grew 24.3%. For the third quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue or ARR was approximately $1.5 billion, up 79.2%, non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements for Q3 was approximately $330 million, up to 24.7%, transaction-based ARR was approximately $685 million, up 639% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was flat at approximately $471 million. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.77 billion, up to 14.3%. Because the vast majority of NIC\u2019s revenues are transaction based, their backlog at quarter end was only $27 million. Excluding the addition of NIC, Tyler\u2019s backlog grew 12.6%. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were very robust at $601 million, up 105.7% and includes the transaction-based revenues of NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were strong at approximately $40 -- $444 million, up 51.9%, fueled by the renewal of the State of Illinois fixed fee e-filing arrangement of approximately $63 million and the addition of the two Delaware appraisal deals totaling $19 million. For the trailing 12 months bookings were approximately $1.6 billion, up 31.3% and on an organic basis were approximately $1.4 billion, up 10.8%. Our software subscription bookings in the third quarter added $19 million in new annual recurring revenue. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both record highs for the third quarter at $205.4 million and $192.8 million, respectively. Our balance sheet remains very strong. During the quarter we repaid the outstanding balance of $65 million on our revolver and paid down $57.5 million on our term loans for a total debt reduction of $122.5 million. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.428 billion in cash and investments of $348.4 million and net leverage of approximately 2.3 times trailing pro forma EBITDA. We expect the net leverage to be approximately 2 times by year end. We have raised our revenue and EPS guidance for the full year 2021 to reflect our strong year-to-date performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter. We expect 2021 total GAAP revenues will be between $1.577 billion and $1.597 billion and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.580 billion and $1.6 billion. We expect total revenues will include approximately $72 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC\u2019s TourHealth and Pandemic Unemployment Services that are expected to wind down in the first half of 2022. We expect 2021 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.55 and $3.63, and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $6.94 and $7.02. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Lynn.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. I\u2019m extremely pleased with our third quarter results, both from Tyler\u2019s core operations and from NIC and its first full quarter as part of Tyler. When we spoke to investors in June, we discussed four priorities around the NIC acquisition for 2021. First, don\u2019t mess up the business. Second, achieve our 2021 plans for both businesses. Third, retain NIC staff and establish the long-term leadership team. And fourth, identify and launch joint strategic initiatives and get our sales teams aligned. I\u2019m happy to say we are executing on all of those objectives. Both businesses are executing at a high level and are exceeding our 2021 plans. The NIC team under the leadership of Elizabeth Proudfit is enthusiastic about the combination and the opportunities ahead with Tyler. And we\u2019ve hit the ground running, with teams actively working on integration and go-to-market strategies. We\u2019re showcasing Tyler products to NIC\u2019s entire state general manager team and NIC\u2019s general managers are providing detailed reviews of the NIC state enterprise contracts and relationships for Tyler\u2019s team. We\u2019ve also established a payments technology integration plan and are in the process of finalizing the joint Tyler/NIC payments organization. We\u2019ve already had some early success and join opportunities, such as our contract with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies that includes NIC Payment Processing, Tyler\u2019s Entellitrak Regulatory Solutions and our Socrata Data & Insights platform, as well as the recent NIC contract with Virginia for solution for the Rent Relief Program, which also includes Tyler\u2019s Socrata applications. We have a current pipeline of more than 40 qualified sell-through opportunities with NIC\u2019s state enterprise market across multiple Tyler solutions and have identified Tyler sales opportunities leveraging NIC state enterprise contracts to speed up the time from award to contract. We\u2019re also beginning to build our combined payments pipeline, with early sales in Florida and Louisiana. We continue to see positive trends in public sector market activity. Indicators such as proposals, sales demonstrations and pipelines are all up significantly from 2020 and are generally at or in some cases above pre-COVID levels. Our competitive -- our competitiveness remains strong as reflected by high win rates across our major applications. Well, not yet a significant factor. We\u2019re starting to see purchasing activity that has identified is being funded through the federal stimulus under the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan. We expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments, and $167 billion of aid to schools under the American Rescue Plan Act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects, and potentially provide a tailwind over the next two years to three years. A survey by the National Association of CIOs indicated that most state CIOs expect that remote work will continue and the need for digital services will increase. CIOs also said they plan to modernize legacy systems in the next two years, with human services and public welfare, labor and employment and health services notice priorities. Tyler is well-positioned to help public sector leaders address those needs. We also remain on track with our R&D projects around our cloud initiative and with our progress toward hosting new SaaS implementations and on-premises conversions in AWS. Our cloud operation team is engaged in 2022 planning, with a focus on continued product optimization, data center migration and operations maturity. Finally, I want to welcome the newest member of Tyler\u2019s executive leadership team, Kevin Iwersen, who joined Tyler earlier this month as Chief Information Officer. Kevin is a seasoned IT leader with experience managing technology infrastructures for corporations, statewide judicial courts, statewide executive government agencies and U.S. military organizations, most recently serving as CIO for the Idaho Judicial Branch. Kevin will work closely with our former CIO, Matt Bieri, until Matt\u2019s retirement early next year. I\u2019d also like to express our deep appreciation to Matt for his tremendous leadership of our IT and hosting organization over the last 11 years and wish him the best in his retirement. With that, we\u2019d like to open up the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt VanVliet from BTIG. Please go ahead.\nMatt VanVliet: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question and nice job on the quarter. I guess pertaining to the commentary that was in both the press release and you\u2019ve talked about this morning in terms of some of the stimulus funding finally sort of making its way into the market. Wondering if you could give us some additional color in terms of where you\u2019re seeing some of that coming through now, where are some of the newer sales activities pertaining to jurisdictions that feel like they have more budget to spend and maybe you are looking at nice to have types of projects and anything additionally around types of products that they\u2019re most interested in terms of using that funding? Thanks.\nLynn Moore: Yeah. Sure. Matt, It\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re starting to track a little bit more. I\u2019d say, you\u2019re seeing it really across a lot of our solutions. But I think we\u2019ve seen a lot really on the enterprise side. We\u2019re seeing a little bit in schools and we\u2019ve seen some over on NIC. I think right now, if you look at Q3 and Q4, there are a few dozen deals out there that that are certainly being spurred right now through some of that federal stimulus spending and I\u2019d expect some of that to continue.\nMatt VanVliet: Great. Thanks. And then following up, I guess, on the exact sort of contribution of what the NIC business is looking like in the guidance for kind of the full year what the contribution looks like, understanding that some of that was one-time. But Brian, if you could help us just kind of what the underlying core business is contributing there and kind of what the growth continues to look like on a forward basis? Thanks.\nBrian Miller: Yeah. So exploiting NIC, the current guidance would have Tyler\u2019s forecasts, I guess, the midpoint of our guidance would be around a $1.224 billion revenues and that would be the midpoint around 9.5% growth for the full year and that would imply, again, at the midpoint of our guidance around 11% growth for the core Tyler operations in the fourth quarter. And NIC, as we had discussed, the COVID-related initiative revenues have continued beyond when we thought even at the end of last quarter, they would wind down. We had at the end of last quarter our guidance had about $17 million for the second half of the year and we did $43 million under those initiatives in Q3 and now expect the full year to be about $72 million, so about another $13 million or so in the fourth quarter and some of that then continuing on into next year. But NIC\u2019s core growth excluding this core -- the COVID initiatives was around 5% in the fourth quarter, I\u2019m sorry, in the third quarter. And there\u2019s some seasonality in their fourth quarter core operations, particularly around the holidays and some of the transaction volumes tend to fall in the fourth quarter. So their fourth quarter probably is what our guidance reflects that in the fourth quarter numbers.\nMatt VanVliet: Great. Thanks for all the color. I appreciate taking the question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Berg from Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nScott Berg: Hi, Lynn and Brian. Congrats on a really good quarter here. I guess I get several questions is, bookings were quite strong in the quarter especially excluding NIC. Lynn, if we dissect those a little bit, how much of the bookings in the quarter are maybe catch up deals that were pushed from the earlier stages of the pandemic just into the current period or you kind of seen more of a return to a normalized deal cadence here, which you\u2019ve been enjoying for the last decade or so?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. I think it\u2019s a combination of a couple things, Scott. We did have a couple of very large deals that we signed in the quarter, which obviously were absent in Q3. Q3 was difficult last year. But I think, as I mentioned in my comments, when you look at the market activity and what I\u2019ve talked about over the last several quarters is, over the last 18 months or so the pandemic is sort of affected different parts of our business a little bit differently. Some were hit a little bit harder and I think I\u2019ve mentioned before that if you look at, for example, our mid-to-higher end financials are Munis product. That was an area that was hit a little bit harder and what you\u2019re seeing there, for example, is you\u2019re seeing awards and deals that are actually exceeding pre-COVID levels and I think that\u2019s the example of what you just mentioned, which is, it\u2019s really the example that both pent-up activity, as well as I think, sort of validate some of the investments and some of the strategy that we\u2019ve been doing over the last couple years.\nScott Berg: Excellent. Thanks. And then from a follow up perspective, Brian, on the guidance for the year, if I back out the added revenues expected from NIC, it looks like your core Tyler guidance is roughly flat for the year. How are you thinking about kind of deal mix around subscription versus license deals, because the bookings were certainly strong, I guess, I would have maybe expected a little bit more increase in kind of the core Tyler revenues, but that\u2019s probably related to maybe stronger subscription bookings mix than maybe what you\u2019re previously expecting?\nBrian Miller: Yeah. I\u2019d say that\u2019s accurate. We\u2019re generally expecting the mix to continue to trend toward an increasing percentage of SaaS. Now, the fourth quarter, as you know, typically is a strong quarter for Public Safety, which still is primarily on-premises and so that tempers that a bit, but that also was the case last year. But, in general, we expect an ongoing continuation of the trends we\u2019ve seen where a higher percentage of the mix is SaaS.\nLynn Moore: Yeah. I think I\u2019d add there, Scott, that it\u2019s -- the amount of SaaS is actually, even exceeded our going into year expectations and while we expected the market to be moving this way, we talked before the pandemic has certainly accelerated that. And you look at areas, I\u2019ll mention, Munis again, I mean, we\u2019re north of 85% of our deals are SaaS now, you look at our lower end financials and in code north of 80%, while last year they were 50%. So there is some of that headwind. I think as the model continues to play out, we\u2019ll get on the other side of that.\nScott Berg: Excellent. Thanks for the color. Great quarter guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ethan Bruck from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. It\u2019s -- I think this is -- it\u2019s Alex here from Wolfe. So a couple questions for me. First, if we think about the, I wanted to ask about the maintenance revenue in the quarter, the maintenance revenue was, I think, a down a bit sequentially. Are you starting to see -- is that conversion activity starting to pick up a little bit and how should we think about it in Q4 and beyond?\nBrian Miller: Yeah. I think that\u2019s accurate. So each of the last couple of quarters have been new all-time highs for us in terms of the number of conversions, and certainly, when you look back at the last four quarters, which all kind of filter into the maintenance growth. The last four quarters have well exceeded the flips or conversions that we saw in the prior year and just as the new business is shifting towards more SaaS, there\u2019s an increasing interest in on-prem customers flipping. So that does have a negative effect on maintenance, but generally they\u2019re -- the revenues that are going into the subscription side as they flip is about 2x what the maintenance was. So that\u2019s a component on the other side of the high growth in subscriptions. And then you look at the mix of new business over the last year, as it continues to shift towards more SaaS and less license that has an effect on the growth as well. And then the last thing is some attrition around our legacy product at -- in the federal business, where the federal government has mandated some states to move off of our product and onto a federal provided product that\u2019s had a bit of an impact there as well. So but the flips, I\u2019d say, are the biggest impact those ongoing conversions and that\u2019ll continue to be the case and at some point, over the next couple of years have likely be a significant acceleration in those as we have the ability to accelerate that through moving those customers in AWS.\nLynn Moore: Yeah. I think, Alex, to -- I guess to summarize, if you look out over the next couple years, you\u2019ll see that subscription revenue line continuing to grow at an increasing pace. Conversely, you\u2019ll see licenses contract proportionately and maintenance will probably continue to flatten out, as Brian mentioned is, as those annual increases started getting offset by flips, which our flips are up significantly year-over-year from last quarter.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. And I guess, maybe on the NIC side, so as you talked a little bit about the increasing -- increase in synergy opportunities that that you\u2019re starting to see in the base. When should we think about, like, when we think about the -- that 5% growth that for that core NIC business that you talked about? Is that something, like, how should we think about that trending or it is an acceleration that that is going to be you guys think is sustainable from that level from here kind of ex the one-time revenues from COVID? And on the COVID impact, is there any reason why we do think that they end in the first half next year or are there any of those that actually have the potential to be more durable, given the variability of mandates?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. I\u2019ll start with the last one. I guess, I would say, on a personal note, I think, I\u2019ve said before, I would -- I wouldn\u2019t be -- I\u2019d be happy if it ended. That means that COVID is getting further in our rearview mirror. It\u2019s our expectation. The revenues right now are primarily out of three areas, it\u2019s out of the State of South Carolina, where they\u2019re the primary -- doing the primary testing, also the State of Nevada and then we\u2019ve mentioned the Virginia Unemployment Relief stuff. If the expectation is, I mean, it is a little bit of a guess, but it\u2019s an educated guess and we\u2019re assuming that that will wind down. What\u2019s interesting about the South Carolina revenues as that will move from a contractor role to a subcontractor role, so while those revenues will still continue and eventually taper off, I think, our margins on those will increase. I think what\u2019s important about the COVID initiative, though, is it really shows the ability of NIC\u2019s team to innovate, it shows their agility and it also shows the relationships that they have with their state enterprise contracts that they could spin these things up quickly and create new solutions and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s exciting. When you talk about, I think, your first question was about growth rates going forward. We\u2019re excited. I can\u2019t tell you how excited the sales teams are, as they meet, they get together. I think as we move forward, we talk about selling all our different products through the NIC\u2019s sales channels, and conversely, what we can bring to NIC, but you think about with Tyler Payments and we\u2019re already seeing a lot of our Socrata Data & Insights and Entellitrak platform, Public Safety and Civic and Munis, all those deals are in the pipeline and I don\u2019t know that going forward, we\u2019ll always be able to sort of segregate, oh, these were NIC deals, because these are Tyler products going through them. We probably at some point won\u2019t continue to isolate the NIC revenue growth, but what we see overall with Tyler is as part of this acquisition and part of the underlying rationale is that we believe that will help drive Tyler\u2019s overall revenue growth at a higher level than it would have on its own.\nAlex Zukin: That\u2019s super helpful. And then the last question I wanted to ask about the IRS contract. Is there a way to dimensionalize at least what the expectation may have been for that revenue stream in 2022 before the cancellation of the agreement and any thought for us in terms of how we should think about modeling that for next year?\nLynn Moore: I\u2019ll start but I don\u2019t see if you have the number, but the revenues in 2022 -- the expected revenues in 2022, we have a number, Brian will get it. But a little bit was uncertain, because how fast we could get up and running and with the payment starting early in the year, the real revenue, I think, expansion was going to happen in the later years of the contract. There were some significant revenues expected. And to be honest, it\u2019s my expectation that this procurement will come back out in the sometime this year. We\u2019ll bid it again and for the reasons we won the first time, we should be extremely competitive going forward. Brian, you have\u2026\nBrian Miller: Yeah. We have talked about that last quarter, when we had gotten the award and I believe that number was, there were multiple providers and I believe the number was $40 million to $60 million in gross revenues and something more, I think, in the $5 million to $6 million range on a net basis after all the interchange fees. But we currently expect that, while we\u2019re virtually certain that there won\u2019t be any revenues in 2022, that while the IRS works through this procurement process that the existing vendors will be held in for another year. So now those weren\u2019t in a -- none of those revenues have started already. So there was nothing in our current base that goes away. But it\u2019s pretty clear that won\u2019t be a 2022 impact at this point and we\u2019ll see how fast the new procurement takes place.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. Thank you, guys. Congrats.\nOperator: The next question comes from Charlie Strauzer from CJS Securities. Please go ahead.\nCharlie Strauzer: Hi. Good morning. A quick question for you, I know you don\u2019t like to give out formal 2022 guidance until the next call, but maybe some early thoughts on, so what you\u2019re thinking about for next year?\nLynn Moore: Well, you\u2019re right, Charlie, we don\u2019t like to get out ahead of ourselves. We -- right now we are well into our 2022 planning. There\u2019s a lot of variations, lot of factors that go into that. We\u2019re still in the early stages. I\u2019d say, we\u2019re kind of on track with our normal planning process. I\u2019d really expect to have better information later this year. I think it\u2019s just a little too early right now to go ahead and forecast 2022.\nCharlie Strauzer: That\u2019s fair. No problem. And then just looking at the labor side, a lot of companies having labor issues, trying to find new qualified people, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not immune to that as well. Maybe you can talk a little bit about the labor side, any difficulties you have in there, the cause in wage inflation, et cetera? Thanks.\nLynn Moore: Yeah. Charlie, I think, that\u2019s a good point. It\u2019s -- we\u2019re all reading in the news, what\u2019s going on across multiple industries. The labor market is certainly evolving right now. There\u2019s staffing pressures. There\u2019s wage pressures. And I\u2019d say, Tyler hasn\u2019t been immune to that. I think there\u2019s still a little to figure out about how permanent this is versus how transitory it is. You\u2019re seeing people leaving careers for lifestyle changes. We call it sort of COVID casualties. You\u2019re seeing competition for wages and more people are now being more accepted to flexible work and work work-from-home that you\u2019re seeing people come in and go into markets that they may not have traditionally tried to hire people from and we\u2019re dealing with that as well. I think if you look across a lot of our business units, we\u2019re staffed a little bit under plan. Our HR team and our recruiters are doing a really good job responding to this. Working really hard, but it is something that\u2019s it\u2019s top of mind. It\u2019s something that we discussed at the executive level, and you\u2019re right, Tyler has not been immune to it.\nCharlie Strauzer: And just speak up on a little bit more when you look at your current employment base, are you still asking people to kind of move back on site and into the offices this fall?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. So we\u2019re on track to sort of -- we\u2019ve taken a phase-based approach and we\u2019ve taken a locally-based phase-based approach is, as the jurist -- each jurisdiction is a little bit different the way they\u2019ve handled it. And so essentially we\u2019re on track right now to sort of come back to what we would call full back in the office at the first of the year. What that means is probably not exactly what it meant before COVID. There will be a little bit more flexibility. That\u2019s part of the market today and so I\u2019d expect some of that going before.\nCharlie Strauzer: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rob Oliver from Baird. Please go ahead.\nRob Oliver: Great. Thank you, guys. Good morning. My question, first question is, Lynn, on Public Safety, just wanted to dive into that a little bit, it sounds like you guys are excited about Arx deal in terms of the full suite of products that it gives you guys for police. So I wanted to ask about that and whether we would expect that to be available in the bag of solutions for your Public Safety sales folks that are closing deals in the all important Q4 here? And then just a broader question about what you guys are seeing and hearing from customers and Public Safety. I mean, it\u2019s really been a secured its type of a year where we went from defined and now it seems like more in fund environment? And just curious what that means for you guys relative to the pipeline in your confidence levels on public safety into Q4? And then I had a quick follow-up.\nLynn Moore: Yeah. Thanks, Rob. That\u2019s a good question. Arx is a -- yeah, we are excited about Arx, it is relatively small acquisition. Even Arx really it\u2019s a database solution that that really helps the Chief of Police, helps the command staff, helps supervisors, really had more insight in the activity of the law enforcement that are on the job, helps with compliance issues, helps promote officer wellness by doing things like identifying stress, risk mitigation. And you\u2019re right, there has been sort of talk around Public Safety area and a lot of different areas, and a lot of focus lately and has been on law enforcement reform and this was something that was missing in our product suite. Arx is a company that\u2019s based in Detroit, which is close to our Public Safety office in Detroit. They had been a partner of Public Safety in a number of deals. This solution had been sought out more and more, and you\u2019re right, it really rounds out our portfolio of Public Safety Solutions. I\u2019d expect it to be something like we do a lot of acquisitions that it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to sell in our Insight channels and it\u2019s also going to become a differentiator in new deals. You\u2019re seeing more and more Public Safety entities looking for these types of solutions for the reasons you just talked about. When you talk about the funding for Public Safety, I mentioned earlier that are, different parts of our business were impacted differently and Public Safety is not suggesting it wasn\u2019t impacted, but it\u2019s still going pretty good. The number of license deals that has got this year, they\u2019re expected licenses are up over 35% year-over-year. We\u2019ve talked a lot before about the investments we\u2019ve made there and then the number of deals that will be $1 million plus in license will be more than we\u2019ve ever had before. I think the funding is there, the initiatives are there and I -- we\u2019ve been making a lot of investments and we\u2019ve done some acquisitions to have round mobility and things like that, that make us even more competitive. So I\u2019m pretty still -- I\u2019m still very excited about where we stand with Public Safety and where the future is for that.\nRob Oliver: Great. I appreciate that\u2019s great color. Thanks, Lynn. And then just one follow-up, I know, Matt, asked that first question about, the stimulus funds and you touched on that. But I just did want to follow up, just briefly, because you guys said in both the press release and in your comments here that, you\u2019re starting to see some deals that are specifically related to that funding and you mentioned, I think, the pipeline of I think it doesn\u2019t spurred by fed -- federal stim. Just curious, what you\u2019re hearing from customers. You mentioned a pretty wide swath of Tyler products and is -- can we assume that the bulk of Tyler\u2019s products would qualify and our available under that and then, if not, you -- I think you mentioned kind of potential tailwind over many years. So are there two ways to think about this, is it one way to think about it. Yes, federal stimulus dollars are going to be flowing to Tyler clear positive. Another would be that budgets being shored up also creates opportunities for more confidence in spending or is that kind of the right way to think about a couple of different buckets? Appreciate it.\nLynn Moore: Yeah. I\u2019d say and to clarify my comments earlier, if you look at the deals in Q3 and Q4. I\u2019d say, there is probably a few dozen deals where they\u2019re being impacted. I\u2019m not suggesting that they\u2019re being fully funded, but they are -- there may be partial funding or part of the equation. I think your comment is around confidence is something that I\u2019ve touched on before and I believe that the confidence of having that blanket behind them along with generally what\u2019s been going on in the market is helpful for all the deals. We are seeing federal stimulus, when I talk about these few dozen deals, they are across different products of Tyler. I don\u2019t know that I would necessarily single out more than others. Although, there are some stimulus dollars that are specifically tied to schools. So, I think, generally it\u2019s a positive. It\u2019s something that\u2019s still a lot of our clients and prospective clients are -- there is still a lot of them still trying to figure out, how do we access them, which dollars are actually there and it\u2019s something that our marketing team in conjunction with our sales teams are putting together materials to help educate our clients and help navigate them where we can. But, yeah, it\u2019s a tailwind. Generally speaking, it\u2019s hard to quantify at this point. But, overall, I think, it\u2019s part of our -- it\u2019s part of the reason for optimism we have at Tyler.\nBrian Miller: And the American Rescue Plan, there is not much restrictions on what they can use it for us. So, I\u2019d say, generally almost anything Tyler has in our portfolio is would be available to be purchased or acquired through the ARP funds and they have until the end of 2024 to spend those funds. And the indications we have is that it\u2019s a very small percentage of those funds that have so far been spent or even allocated, there is still a lot of work going on in governments around determining how they\u2019re going to spend those. But there it\u2019s -- there\u2019s a lot of flexibility around what they can spend those on.\nRob Oliver: Yeah. I think they\u2019re trying to route one or two school buses for our whole district. So I ask those guys to give you guys a call. So, hopefully, you\u2019ve got that from here in Connecticut. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nKirk Materne: Yeah. Thanks very much and congrats on a good quarter. Lynn, I was wondering if you could talk or Brian if you could talk about just sort of the bookings level for NIC on an organic basis and I know obviously the core Tyler bookings were up a lot. But NIC\u2019s growth of that 5% or is the book ahead of that rate right now. I realize there some rev rec things that make it a little tricky, but are you pleased with sort of the bookings trends in NIC right now?\nBrian Miller: Because they\u2019re mostly transaction base their bookings and revenue\u2026\nKirk Materne: Aligned.\nBrian Miller: \u2026are pretty aligned, yes. They have some software business and I had a couple nice deals this quarter, we mentioned our biggest software dealer across Tyler came through NIC. But, generally, the vast majority of their revenues are coming through transactions, they are pretty much aligned. They\u2019re pretty reliable. I guess that there is a little bit of seasonality. So we saw higher growth last quarter, a little bit lower growth this quarter. One of the areas that had been impacted in their business more by COVID is the driver history records, which is a significant part of their business and the growth there is a little slow right now. But expect those to rebound as things get back to normal, but offsetting that is that transaction volumes are generally up given the people are doing more business digitally with state governments. So, but generally, those bookings and revenues would be pretty similar.\nKirk Materne: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Brian. And then, Lynn, as you look ahead 2022, you obviously have a much broader product portfolio at this point in time? What sort of your temperature on in terms of sort of focusing on what you have already harmonizing technology, go-to-market versus doing any other deals. I know you did a couple of smaller tuck-ins this quarter, but you have a huge product portfolio. I assume the focus is going to be on more just sort of again harmonizing the technology of what you have and go-to-market. Is that sort of the way we should be thinking about the strategy in the next year?\nLynn Moore: So I think you\u2019re right, we do have a lot of initiatives going on. We do have a lot of with larger portfolio than we did even three year, four years, five years ago. We are focused on. We did just spend over $2 billion on NIC. We\u2019re clearly focused on that. We\u2019re also clearly focused on our cloud initiatives and things that we need to do to continue to optimize our products and do some things with our internal operations as we move there. I\u2019ve talked before about how we approach M&A generally and we\u2019ve done a little bit this year. And I think earlier when we\u2019re talking about NIC, I said, we may go back to a couple of years ago, where we have a little bit of deliberate pause, we did a couple of other deals this year VendEngine, DataSpec. These were deals that were sort of in the works. I think though as we go into next year, we\u2019re going to remain opportunistic. We\u2019re going to continue to look at deals. I continue to look at deals today. I have been looking at deals over the last couple of months. Even though while we still have all this activity going on and when the right deal is out there. If it fits a need, whether it\u2019s small, medium or large, we will definitely still in the position to execute on that and then I would expect that we would.\nKirk Materne: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. All right. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKeith Housum: Good morning, guys. And I\u2019ll echo the quarter was great for you guys. Congratulations. Recall that the NIC business and just revisiting the prior question, it seems like the driver history record for NIC is not been up to par since really COVID began. Is there anything structurally that perhaps has changed at the driver history records perhaps might not go back to the previous gross -- growth trajectory they had?\nLynn Moore: I didn\u2019t quite hear the question.\nBrian Miller: Oh! I don\u2019t -- we\u2019re not aware of anything structurally, fundamentally that\u2019s changed around that. We expect that those will rebound back to normal levels. Certainly, there is no change in the way insurance companies are getting their information, but -- and there hasn\u2019t been a change in our pricing, at least no negative change and I know in some of our renewals we\u2019ve been able to get increases in pricing. So don\u2019t think there\u2019s any fundamental change around the DHR side.\nKeith Housum: Got you. Okay. Appreciate it. And the length of your contracts, obviously, I was 3.4 years and average this quarter was very good. I remember back to previous conversations, the idea was short of time spend opportunity have raised -- to raise prices on the contract renewals. Can you talk about the success you guys are having in terms of pricing changes as contracts are coming up for renewal?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. I think in the last -- there hasn\u2019t really been a change through COVID. We\u2019ve been generally in maintenance agreements. We\u2019ve targeted kind of in the 4% to 5% annual increases in on subscription renewals, targets are generally in that same range. And as you said the shortening the initial terms because those revenues are straight lined over the term of the agreement, gives us the opportunity to realize the benefit of those increases sooner. And generally we\u2019re leading with shorter terms and this quarter had success with that. Occasionally, particularly on some of the large contracts like I think back to the North Carolina courts injustice we have a 10-year agreement. So that can bounce around a bit. But we do prefer to have shorter agreements and the pricing has been in line with what we\u2019ve historically tried to achieve.\nKeith Housum: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jonathan Ho from William Blair & Company. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Ho: Hi. Good morning. Congrats on the strong results. I just wanted to maybe start out with some additional color on the VendEngine and Arx acquisitions that you guys recently made and just potentially understanding what the opportunity is to up-sell these types of opportunities there.\nBrian Miller: Yeah. Sure, Jonathan. VendEngine, we\u2019re pretty excited about that acquisition. It was a little bit larger. We\u2019re excited about both. But I didn\u2019t mean to imply. We\u2019re excited about Arx. I think I just talked about Arx a little bit. But for VendEngine corrections -- and the corrections market for us with something that we\u2019ve really seen as a significant growth opportunity. We\u2019ve been investing in some in our core corrections product for some time. It\u2019s a key part of our Tyler alliance, which our Connected Communities Vision and it\u2019s really sort of -- the corrections area is sort of the crossover points between courts and Public Safety and is probably the largest market and this is white space that we didn\u2019t really have a leading product. And inmate services is becoming increasingly important to that opportunity. There is more and more requirements in RFPs around there. We partnered with VendEngine over years in a number of deals and they\u2019re really just a leader there. I expect that the revenue this year will be somewhere in the $20 million all IRR and it\u2019s been growing at 30% plus for the last few years. I do think we have enough opportunity to sell that into our existing client base, but also it will help us lead with our corrections and standalone deals. So we\u2019re pretty excited about that deal. Similarly with Arx, I talked a little bit about -- before about the focus on law enforcement reform and that was a bit of a hole in our portfolio, again almost similar playbook, we had worked with them some, really like them, really like the product, good cultural fit and we really think it will round out our portfolio, and as you mentioned, selling back into our base. I mean our existing customer base is something I say all the time, it\u2019s our greatest asset and the more solutions we have, the more that we can push through there and drive growth.\nJonathan Ho: Got it. And on that multiproduct sale point, can you -- maybe give us a sense of how to better understand how some of these incremental products have been uplifting your deals. I think the examples that you cited, you did mentioned a number of multiproduct opportunities. What should we think about in terms of maybe net expansion rates or the ability to cross-sell more into the base over time, as well as multiproduct on new sales? Thank you.\nBrian Miller: Yeah. You are -- we\u2019re seeing it across all of our solutions and we talk about some of these smaller core tuck-in deals. Those are deals that actually are really are being sold quite a bit now across our product lines. You look at Public Safety for example. We\u2019ve talked about deals where we sell either our core cat or core records. But it also includes things like Socrata and you probably heard us mentioned Data -- Data & Insight is becoming a differentiator for us across many product lines. But we also talk about Mobility and Brazos, SoftCode and Mobilized. These are all products that were done through acquisitions in the last three years, four years, five years or so. You see it on the enterprise side, things like ExecuTime, time and attendance management. We\u2019ve seen it in the court space and it is part of our overall strategy and it makes us that much more competitive as we have a wider range of solutions and sort of an enterprise suite as we compete against people who don\u2019t have such a diverse set of solutions to fit the client needs.\nJonathan Ho: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Peter Heckmann from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nPeter Heckmann: Hey. Thanks for taking my call. I appreciate it. I\u2019m trying to figure out on just appraisal and also a big part of the business, but it seems like there have been some notable wins there. Do we expect a real step function change in the size of that appraisal business or other older contracts rolling off and you\u2019re appraisal should kind of continue to be a pretty consistent contributor?\nLynn Moore: I\u2019d say broadly it\u2019s pretty consistent. We have deals. These projects often our multiyear projects sometimes two years or three years, sometimes longer. Some of them are driven by legislated cycles in certain state like Indiana and Ohio that have regular cycles, where we have the almost like recurring appraisal projects. Others are more one-off. These three counties in Delaware that comprise all of Delaware that we\u2019re getting ready to start. It was a court-ordered reappraisal, so sometimes the courts get involved when it\u2019s determined that appraisals are out of date and maybe contributing to unfair distribution of taxes. So that\u2019s the case with these. And we are pretty uniquely positioned to be able to have a strong competitive position in those large deals and there\u2019s one-off kinds of deals, they can be a little bit lumpy, and but I\u2019d say, we\u2019re generally in a -- at a range we\u2019re probably on a more active period right now, particularly coming out of COVID where some of these projects may have been delayed, but I wouldn\u2019t say it would be a step function, where there is a big step up. But we\u2019re doing really well in that business right now.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then just and thinking about the NIC business and you gave out some renewals of state contracts that appear to be far ahead of their actual expiration date and so as you go through and start talking to these states, are you trying to get them to renew early and opt up for additional years. And just as regard that, we certainly with the change in Texas and Deloitte kind of getting back into the market. How are you thinking about some of their more mid-sized state renewals here over the next 18 months? Do you expect any change in the competitive dynamics or is kind of your base case that a renewal with the ability to up-sell some additional Tyler applications?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. I think is -- I would say, my outlook is pretty optimistic. I will talk about Texas first, our payments business or their -- NIC payments business in Texas is one of our strong outperformance this quarter. When you talk about -- we mentioned Utah and we mentioned Oklahoma, these were early renewals. And part of that actually the reason for the early renewal was some of the excitement that\u2019s been generated through NIC with the customer about what the combined entity of Tyler and NIC can bring. We\u2019ve talked about our Connected Communities Vision. We\u2019ve talk about the different products and offerings that we can bring and I think both of these states were areas where they\u2019re seeing that future and they wanted to get -- they wanted to go ahead and jump in early, which gives me optimism for what I think we\u2019ll see going forward in the market.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. That\u2019s good to hear. That\u2019s all I have for now. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Lynn Moore for any closing remarks.\nLynn Moore: Great. Thanks, Jason, and thanks everybody for joining us today. We hope you stay safe and healthy and if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Have a good day everybody.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021. In our earnings release, we've included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provides on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $459.9 million, up 60.9%. Non-GAAP revenues were $460.6 million, up 61.1%. On an organic basis GAAP and non-GAAP revenues grew 7.6% and 7.5%, respectively. Software license revenues rose 13.7%. Subscription revenues rose 183.3%. Excluding the contribution from NIC subscription revenues were still very strong, growing 23.9%. We added 144 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 67 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $84 million in total contract value. In Q3 of last year, we added 114 new subscription-based arrangements and had 46 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $56 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 74% of total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 47% in Q3 of last year, reflecting our ongoing shift to a cloud first approach to sales. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.4 years, compared to 4.3 years last year. Transaction based revenues which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions were $171.2 million, up more than six-fold from last year. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $17.4 million, up to 15%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 24.3%. For the third quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue or ARR was approximately $1.5 billion, up 79.2%, non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements for Q3 was approximately $330 million, up to 24.7%, transaction-based ARR was approximately $685 million, up 639% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was flat at approximately $471 million. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.77 billion, up to 14.3%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction based, their backlog at quarter end was only $27 million. Excluding the addition of NIC, Tyler's backlog grew 12.6%. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were very robust at $601 million, up 105.7% and includes the transaction-based revenues of NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were strong at approximately $40 -- $444 million, up 51.9%, fueled by the renewal of the State of Illinois fixed fee e-filing arrangement of approximately $63 million and the addition of the two Delaware appraisal deals totaling $19 million. For the trailing 12 months bookings were approximately $1.6 billion, up 31.3% and on an organic basis were approximately $1.4 billion, up 10.8%. Our software subscription bookings in the third quarter added $19 million in new annual recurring revenue. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both record highs for the third quarter at $205.4 million and $192.8 million, respectively. Our balance sheet remains very strong. During the quarter we repaid the outstanding balance of $65 million on our revolver and paid down $57.5 million on our term loans for a total debt reduction of $122.5 million. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.428 billion in cash and investments of $348.4 million and net leverage of approximately 2.3 times trailing pro forma EBITDA. We expect the net leverage to be approximately 2 times by year end. We have raised our revenue and EPS guidance for the full year 2021 to reflect our strong year-to-date performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter. We expect 2021 total GAAP revenues will be between $1.577 billion and $1.597 billion and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.580 billion and $1.6 billion. We expect total revenues will include approximately $72 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and Pandemic Unemployment Services that are expected to wind down in the first half of 2022. We expect 2021 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.55 and $3.63, and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $6.94 and $7.02. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn. Yeah. So exploiting NIC, the current guidance would have Tyler's forecasts, I guess, the midpoint of our guidance would be around a $1.224 billion revenues and that would be the midpoint around 9.5% growth for the full year and that would imply, again, at the midpoint of our guidance around 11% growth for the core Tyler operations in the fourth quarter. And NIC, as we had discussed, the COVID-related initiative revenues have continued beyond when we thought even at the end of last quarter, they would wind down. We had at the end of last quarter our guidance had about $17 million for the second half of the year and we did $43 million under those initiatives in Q3 and now expect the full year to be about $72 million, so about another $13 million or so in the fourth quarter and some of that then continuing on into next year. But NIC's core growth excluding this core -- the COVID initiatives was around 5% in the fourth quarter, I'm sorry, in the third quarter. And there's some seasonality in their fourth quarter core operations, particularly around the holidays and some of the transaction volumes tend to fall in the fourth quarter. So their fourth quarter probably is what our guidance reflects that in the fourth quarter numbers. Yeah. I'd say that's accurate. We're generally expecting the mix to continue to trend toward an increasing percentage of SaaS. Now, the fourth quarter, as you know, typically is a strong quarter for Public Safety, which still is primarily on-premises and so that tempers that a bit, but that also was the case last year. But, in general, we expect an ongoing continuation of the trends we've seen where a higher percentage of the mix is SaaS. Yeah. I think that's accurate. So each of the last couple of quarters have been new all-time highs for us in terms of the number of conversions, and certainly, when you look back at the last four quarters, which all kind of filter into the maintenance growth. The last four quarters have well exceeded the flips or conversions that we saw in the prior year and just as the new business is shifting towards more SaaS, there's an increasing interest in on-prem customers flipping. So that does have a negative effect on maintenance, but generally they're -- the revenues that are going into the subscription side as they flip is about 2x what the maintenance was. So that's a component on the other side of the high growth in subscriptions. And then you look at the mix of new business over the last year, as it continues to shift towards more SaaS and less license that has an effect on the growth as well. And then the last thing is some attrition around our legacy product at -- in the federal business, where the federal government has mandated some states to move off of our product and onto a federal provided product that's had a bit of an impact there as well. So but the flips, I'd say, are the biggest impact those ongoing conversions and that'll continue to be the case and at some point, over the next couple of years have likely be a significant acceleration in those as we have the ability to accelerate that through moving those customers in AWS. Yeah. We have talked about that last quarter, when we had gotten the award and I believe that number was, there were multiple providers and I believe the number was $40 million to $60 million in gross revenues and something more, I think, in the $5 million to $6 million range on a net basis after all the interchange fees. But we currently expect that, while we're virtually certain that there won't be any revenues in 2022, that while the IRS works through this procurement process that the existing vendors will be held in for another year. So now those weren't in a -- none of those revenues have started already. So there was nothing in our current base that goes away. But it's pretty clear that won't be a 2022 impact at this point and we'll see how fast the new procurement takes place. And the American Rescue Plan, there is not much restrictions on what they can use it for us. So, I'd say, generally almost anything Tyler has in our portfolio is would be available to be purchased or acquired through the ARP funds and they have until the end of 2024 to spend those funds. And the indications we have is that it's a very small percentage of those funds that have so far been spent or even allocated, there is still a lot of work going on in governments around determining how they're going to spend those. But there it's -- there's a lot of flexibility around what they can spend those on. Because they're mostly transaction base their bookings and revenue... ...are pretty aligned, yes. They have some software business and I had a couple nice deals this quarter, we mentioned our biggest software dealer across Tyler came through NIC. But, generally, the vast majority of their revenues are coming through transactions, they are pretty much aligned. They're pretty reliable. I guess that there is a little bit of seasonality. So we saw higher growth last quarter, a little bit lower growth this quarter. One of the areas that had been impacted in their business more by COVID is the driver history records, which is a significant part of their business and the growth there is a little slow right now. But expect those to rebound as things get back to normal, but offsetting that is that transaction volumes are generally up given the people are doing more business digitally with state governments. So, but generally, those bookings and revenues would be pretty similar. Oh! I don't -- we're not aware of anything structurally, fundamentally that's changed around that. We expect that those will rebound back to normal levels. Certainly, there is no change in the way insurance companies are getting their information, but -- and there hasn't been a change in our pricing, at least no negative change and I know in some of our renewals we've been able to get increases in pricing. So don't think there's any fundamental change around the DHR side. Yeah. Sure, Jonathan. VendEngine, we're pretty excited about that acquisition. It was a little bit larger. We're excited about both. But I didn't mean to imply. We're excited about Arx. I think I just talked about Arx a little bit. But for VendEngine corrections -- and the corrections market for us with something that we've really seen as a significant growth opportunity. We've been investing in some in our core corrections product for some time. It's a key part of our Tyler alliance, which our Connected Communities Vision and it's really sort of -- the corrections area is sort of the crossover points between courts and Public Safety and is probably the largest market and this is white space that we didn't really have a leading product. And inmate services is becoming increasingly important to that opportunity. There is more and more requirements in RFPs around there. We partnered with VendEngine over years in a number of deals and they're really just a leader there. I expect that the revenue this year will be somewhere in the $20 million all IRR and it's been growing at 30% plus for the last few years. I do think we have enough opportunity to sell that into our existing client base, but also it will help us lead with our corrections and standalone deals. So we're pretty excited about that deal. Similarly with Arx, I talked a little bit about -- before about the focus on law enforcement reform and that was a bit of a hole in our portfolio, again almost similar playbook, we had worked with them some, really like them, really like the product, good cultural fit and we really think it will round out our portfolio, and as you mentioned, selling back into our base. I mean our existing customer base is something I say all the time, it's our greatest asset and the more solutions we have, the more that we can push through there and drive growth. Yeah. You are -- we're seeing it across all of our solutions and we talk about some of these smaller core tuck-in deals. Those are deals that actually are really are being sold quite a bit now across our product lines. You look at Public Safety for example. We've talked about deals where we sell either our core cat or core records. But it also includes things like Socrata and you probably heard us mentioned Data -- Data & Insight is becoming a differentiator for us across many product lines. But we also talk about Mobility and Brazos, SoftCode and Mobilized. These are all products that were done through acquisitions in the last three years, four years, five years or so. You see it on the enterprise side, things like ExecuTime, time and attendance management. We've seen it in the court space and it is part of our overall strategy and it makes us that much more competitive as we have a wider range of solutions and sort of an enterprise suite as we compete against people who don't have such a diverse set of solutions to fit the client needs."

            "name": "Lynn Moore",
            "content": "Thank you, Jason, and welcome to our call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I'll have some comments on our quarter and then Brian will review the details of our results. I'll end with some additional comments and then we'll take questions. Brian? Thanks, Brian. Our third quarter results were exceptionally strong, building on the momentum we established in the first half of the year. This was our first full quarter including NICs results and it was our best quarter ever by most financial measures. We achieved new quarterly highs and revenues, non-GAAP EPS, free cash flow, adjusted EBITDA, bookings and backlog. Total revenues grew 60.9%, with organic growth of 7.6%. As a result of the surge in the Delta variant, NIC's COVID-19 related revenues from TourHealth and Pandemic Unemployment initiatives were significantly above plan at $43.3 million. We had expected those revenues which have relatively low margins to wind down in the second half of the year. But we now expect they will continue into the first half of 2022. NIC's core revenues grew 5% in the quarter. Recurring revenues comprised over 80% of our quarterly revenues for the first time and were led by 183% growth in subscription revenues. Excluding NIC revenues, subscription revenue growth was robust at 23.9%, reflecting our accelerating shift to the cloud. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 55 quarters of the last 63 quarters. Software licenses and services revenues grew 13.9% or 2% excluding NIC. As expected, our margins compressed compared to last year third quarter. Some expenses like tradeshows and employee health claims, as well as lower margin revenues like billable travel that declined in 2020 due to COVID pandemic have begun to return this year. Margins were also impacted by the inclusion of NIC and particularly by the continuation of their lower margin COVID initiative revenues. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 330 basis points to 25.3%. Excluding NICs COVID initiative revenues and related costs, our non-GAAP operating margin was 26.8%. Bookings reached a record high in third quarter at approximately $601 million, more than double last year third quarter. Excluding NIC, bookings grew 51.9%, with the biggest contributor being the $63 million renewal of our fixed fee e-filing arrangement with the State of Illinois. We're very pleased to report early success this quarter with joint sales efforts between NIC and Tyler Solutions teams. We signed agreements with the Virginia Department of Housing and Community Development valued at approximately $24 million to provide a digital and call center solution for tenant, landlord and third-party filing of Rent Relief Program claims. We will also provide Administrative Dashboards from our Socrata Data & Insight solutions, as well as payment processing capabilities. Our largest software deal the quarter also came from NIC with $6.1 million SaaS contract with the West Virginia Division of Motor Vehicles for digital titling. This new digital vehicle titling and registration management system will go beyond modernization and revolutionize how the DMV manages vehicles and interacts with businesses and citizens. In addition to the streamlining of nearly every vehicle related process in place today, many legacy paper processes will be fully replaced with secure digital solutions. The solution utilizes technology to govern and secure the vehicle ownership process, adding security, reducing fraud and providing the flexibility that other state DMVs operations are lacking. The arrangement, which leverages our State Master Agreement has an initial term of five years. In addition to the SaaS fees, the agreement will generate estimated transaction revenue of more than $3 million per year. I'd like to also highlight a few more significant deals sign this quarter. We signed Appraisal Services contracts with the Delaware counties of Newcastle and Kent. In addition, Newcastle County selected our iasWorld Appraisal Solution under a SaaS arrangement. The deals have a combined value of approximately $19 million. Coupled with the Appraisal Services contract signed last quarter with Sussex County. Tyler will now be performing a property reassessment for the entire state. Also for our iasWorld Property Tax and Appraisal Solution, we signed SaaS arrangements with the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo in Alberta, Canada, valued at approximately $3.1 million. Franklin County, Ohio valued at approximately $3.5 million and Summit County, Ohio, which also includes our Data & Insights Solution, valued at approximately $2.9 million. Other major SaaS deals included a $4.5 million contract with Arlington Heights, Illinois for our ERP Civic Services and Payment Solutions, and a $3.4 million contract with Bayer County, Texas for our Odyssey, SoftCode and Supervision Justice Solutions. Our largest perpetual license contract of the quarter was a $5.4 million contract to provide our MicroPact Entellitrak Solution to manage COVID vaccination adaptations for the U.S. Department of Justice. We also signed a $2.5 million on-premises license contract with the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands for our Munis ERP and Enterprise Asset Management, ExecuTime and Socrata Solutions. We also signed several significant contract renewals with existing clients, including extensions of NIC's State Enterprise Agreements with the States of Utah and Oklahoma, and a five-year renewal of our e-filing arrangement with the State of Illinois, which was expanded to include applications from our Socrata Data & Insights platform. On last quarter's call, we reported that NIC had been selected as one of two vendors to provide the Internal Revenue Service with a Digital Payment Processing Solution that would allow taxpayers to securely pay their federal taxes and that revenue under that contract was expected to begin in January of 2022. Following the award, three entities filed protests with the GAO. Prior to any ruling on the protest by the GAO, the IRS notified the GAO that it was canceling the two awards, including the award to NIC. While the IRS has not formally terminated NIC's contract, it has issued a stop work order under the contract. The IRS indicated that it will either amend the current solicitation, allowing all bidders to modify their previous submissions and then reevaluate the proposals or terminate the existing solicitation and start the process over with a new procurement in the coming months. The IRS has not yet stated which of these options it will select and we have no information regarding the potential timing of either option. Given these recent developments, we do not expect to recognize any revenue under the IRS award in 2022. While the specific concerns raised in the protests have not been made public and are not known by Tyler, the decision to cancel the award to NIC was not related to NIC's performance under the contract, its ability to successfully perform under the contract or any allegations of misconduct or improper behavior by NIC. On the M&A front, we completed the acquisitions of VendEngine and Arx during the third quarter. VendEngine is one of the fastest growing technology companies in North America, operating in more than 230 counties and 32 states. Its leading cloud-based platform provides a comprehensive suite of applications focused on the corrections market, including deposit technologies for commissary, ordering and warehouse management, and various informational electronic communications, security, accounting and financial trust management components. Arx is a cloud-based software platform which creates accessible technology to enable a modern day police force that is fully transparent, accountable and a trusted resource to the community it serves. The acquisition of Arx allows Tyler to offer a full suite of Public Safety Solutions, including Arx Alert and Arx Community, designed to maximize efficiency and safety for law enforcement officers, while increasing transparency and trust building with communities. VendEngine and Arx have combined ARR of approximately $17.5 million and their additions further strengthened Tyler's justice and Public Safety suites. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more details on results of the quarter. Thanks, Brian. I'm extremely pleased with our third quarter results, both from Tyler's core operations and from NIC and its first full quarter as part of Tyler. When we spoke to investors in June, we discussed four priorities around the NIC acquisition for 2021. First, don't mess up the business. Second, achieve our 2021 plans for both businesses. Third, retain NIC staff and establish the long-term leadership team. And fourth, identify and launch joint strategic initiatives and get our sales teams aligned. I'm happy to say we are executing on all of those objectives. Both businesses are executing at a high level and are exceeding our 2021 plans. The NIC team under the leadership of Elizabeth Proudfit is enthusiastic about the combination and the opportunities ahead with Tyler. And we've hit the ground running, with teams actively working on integration and go-to-market strategies. We're showcasing Tyler products to NIC's entire state general manager team and NIC's general managers are providing detailed reviews of the NIC state enterprise contracts and relationships for Tyler's team. We've also established a payments technology integration plan and are in the process of finalizing the joint Tyler/NIC payments organization. We've already had some early success and join opportunities, such as our contract with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies that includes NIC Payment Processing, Tyler's Entellitrak Regulatory Solutions and our Socrata Data & Insights platform, as well as the recent NIC contract with Virginia for solution for the Rent Relief Program, which also includes Tyler's Socrata applications. We have a current pipeline of more than 40 qualified sell-through opportunities with NIC's state enterprise market across multiple Tyler solutions and have identified Tyler sales opportunities leveraging NIC state enterprise contracts to speed up the time from award to contract. We're also beginning to build our combined payments pipeline, with early sales in Florida and Louisiana. We continue to see positive trends in public sector market activity. Indicators such as proposals, sales demonstrations and pipelines are all up significantly from 2020 and are generally at or in some cases above pre-COVID levels. Our competitive -- our competitiveness remains strong as reflected by high win rates across our major applications. Well, not yet a significant factor. We're starting to see purchasing activity that has identified is being funded through the federal stimulus under the CARES Act and the American Rescue Plan. We expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments, and $167 billion of aid to schools under the American Rescue Plan Act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects, and potentially provide a tailwind over the next two years to three years. A survey by the National Association of CIOs indicated that most state CIOs expect that remote work will continue and the need for digital services will increase. CIOs also said they plan to modernize legacy systems in the next two years, with human services and public welfare, labor and employment and health services notice priorities. Tyler is well-positioned to help public sector leaders address those needs. We also remain on track with our R&D projects around our cloud initiative and with our progress toward hosting new SaaS implementations and on-premises conversions in AWS. Our cloud operation team is engaged in 2022 planning, with a focus on continued product optimization, data center migration and operations maturity. Finally, I want to welcome the newest member of Tyler's executive leadership team, Kevin Iwersen, who joined Tyler earlier this month as Chief Information Officer. Kevin is a seasoned IT leader with experience managing technology infrastructures for corporations, statewide judicial courts, statewide executive government agencies and U.S. military organizations, most recently serving as CIO for the Idaho Judicial Branch. Kevin will work closely with our former CIO, Matt Bieri, until Matt's retirement early next year. I'd also like to express our deep appreciation to Matt for his tremendous leadership of our IT and hosting organization over the last 11 years and wish him the best in his retirement. With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A. Yeah. Sure. Matt, It's a good question. It's something that we're starting to track a little bit more. I'd say, you're seeing it really across a lot of our solutions. But I think we've seen a lot really on the enterprise side. We're seeing a little bit in schools and we've seen some over on NIC. I think right now, if you look at Q3 and Q4, there are a few dozen deals out there that that are certainly being spurred right now through some of that federal stimulus spending and I'd expect some of that to continue. Yeah. I think it's a combination of a couple things, Scott. We did have a couple of very large deals that we signed in the quarter, which obviously were absent in Q3. Q3 was difficult last year. But I think, as I mentioned in my comments, when you look at the market activity and what I've talked about over the last several quarters is, over the last 18 months or so the pandemic is sort of affected different parts of our business a little bit differently. Some were hit a little bit harder and I think I've mentioned before that if you look at, for example, our mid-to-higher end financials are Munis product. That was an area that was hit a little bit harder and what you're seeing there, for example, is you're seeing awards and deals that are actually exceeding pre-COVID levels and I think that's the example of what you just mentioned, which is, it's really the example that both pent-up activity, as well as I think, sort of validate some of the investments and some of the strategy that we've been doing over the last couple years. Yeah. I think I'd add there, Scott, that it's -- the amount of SaaS is actually, even exceeded our going into year expectations and while we expected the market to be moving this way, we talked before the pandemic has certainly accelerated that. And you look at areas, I'll mention, Munis again, I mean, we're north of 85% of our deals are SaaS now, you look at our lower end financials and in code north of 80%, while last year they were 50%. So there is some of that headwind. I think as the model continues to play out, we'll get on the other side of that. Yeah. I think, Alex, to -- I guess to summarize, if you look out over the next couple years, you'll see that subscription revenue line continuing to grow at an increasing pace. Conversely, you'll see licenses contract proportionately and maintenance will probably continue to flatten out, as Brian mentioned is, as those annual increases started getting offset by flips, which our flips are up significantly year-over-year from last quarter. Yeah. I'll start with the last one. I guess, I would say, on a personal note, I think, I've said before, I would -- I wouldn't be -- I'd be happy if it ended. That means that COVID is getting further in our rearview mirror. It's our expectation. The revenues right now are primarily out of three areas, it's out of the State of South Carolina, where they're the primary -- doing the primary testing, also the State of Nevada and then we've mentioned the Virginia Unemployment Relief stuff. If the expectation is, I mean, it is a little bit of a guess, but it's an educated guess and we're assuming that that will wind down. What's interesting about the South Carolina revenues as that will move from a contractor role to a subcontractor role, so while those revenues will still continue and eventually taper off, I think, our margins on those will increase. I think what's important about the COVID initiative, though, is it really shows the ability of NIC's team to innovate, it shows their agility and it also shows the relationships that they have with their state enterprise contracts that they could spin these things up quickly and create new solutions and I think that's what's exciting. When you talk about, I think, your first question was about growth rates going forward. We're excited. I can't tell you how excited the sales teams are, as they meet, they get together. I think as we move forward, we talk about selling all our different products through the NIC's sales channels, and conversely, what we can bring to NIC, but you think about with Tyler Payments and we're already seeing a lot of our Socrata Data & Insights and Entellitrak platform, Public Safety and Civic and Munis, all those deals are in the pipeline and I don't know that going forward, we'll always be able to sort of segregate, oh, these were NIC deals, because these are Tyler products going through them. We probably at some point won't continue to isolate the NIC revenue growth, but what we see overall with Tyler is as part of this acquisition and part of the underlying rationale is that we believe that will help drive Tyler's overall revenue growth at a higher level than it would have on its own. I'll start but I don't see if you have the number, but the revenues in 2022 -- the expected revenues in 2022, we have a number, Brian will get it. But a little bit was uncertain, because how fast we could get up and running and with the payment starting early in the year, the real revenue, I think, expansion was going to happen in the later years of the contract. There were some significant revenues expected. And to be honest, it's my expectation that this procurement will come back out in the sometime this year. We'll bid it again and for the reasons we won the first time, we should be extremely competitive going forward. Brian, you have... Well, you're right, Charlie, we don't like to get out ahead of ourselves. We -- right now we are well into our 2022 planning. There's a lot of variations, lot of factors that go into that. We're still in the early stages. I'd say, we're kind of on track with our normal planning process. I'd really expect to have better information later this year. I think it's just a little too early right now to go ahead and forecast 2022. Yeah. Charlie, I think, that's a good point. It's -- we're all reading in the news, what's going on across multiple industries. The labor market is certainly evolving right now. There's staffing pressures. There's wage pressures. And I'd say, Tyler hasn't been immune to that. I think there's still a little to figure out about how permanent this is versus how transitory it is. You're seeing people leaving careers for lifestyle changes. We call it sort of COVID casualties. You're seeing competition for wages and more people are now being more accepted to flexible work and work work-from-home that you're seeing people come in and go into markets that they may not have traditionally tried to hire people from and we're dealing with that as well. I think if you look across a lot of our business units, we're staffed a little bit under plan. Our HR team and our recruiters are doing a really good job responding to this. Working really hard, but it is something that's it's top of mind. It's something that we discussed at the executive level, and you're right, Tyler has not been immune to it. Yeah. So we're on track to sort of -- we've taken a phase-based approach and we've taken a locally-based phase-based approach is, as the jurist -- each jurisdiction is a little bit different the way they've handled it. And so essentially we're on track right now to sort of come back to what we would call full back in the office at the first of the year. What that means is probably not exactly what it meant before COVID. There will be a little bit more flexibility. That's part of the market today and so I'd expect some of that going before. Yeah. Thanks, Rob. That's a good question. Arx is a -- yeah, we are excited about Arx, it is relatively small acquisition. Even Arx really it's a database solution that that really helps the Chief of Police, helps the command staff, helps supervisors, really had more insight in the activity of the law enforcement that are on the job, helps with compliance issues, helps promote officer wellness by doing things like identifying stress, risk mitigation. And you're right, there has been sort of talk around Public Safety area and a lot of different areas, and a lot of focus lately and has been on law enforcement reform and this was something that was missing in our product suite. Arx is a company that's based in Detroit, which is close to our Public Safety office in Detroit. They had been a partner of Public Safety in a number of deals. This solution had been sought out more and more, and you're right, it really rounds out our portfolio of Public Safety Solutions. I'd expect it to be something like we do a lot of acquisitions that it's something we're going to sell in our Insight channels and it's also going to become a differentiator in new deals. You're seeing more and more Public Safety entities looking for these types of solutions for the reasons you just talked about. When you talk about the funding for Public Safety, I mentioned earlier that are, different parts of our business were impacted differently and Public Safety is not suggesting it wasn't impacted, but it's still going pretty good. The number of license deals that has got this year, they're expected licenses are up over 35% year-over-year. We've talked a lot before about the investments we've made there and then the number of deals that will be $1 million plus in license will be more than we've ever had before. I think the funding is there, the initiatives are there and I -- we've been making a lot of investments and we've done some acquisitions to have round mobility and things like that, that make us even more competitive. So I'm pretty still -- I'm still very excited about where we stand with Public Safety and where the future is for that. Yeah. I'd say and to clarify my comments earlier, if you look at the deals in Q3 and Q4. I'd say, there is probably a few dozen deals where they're being impacted. I'm not suggesting that they're being fully funded, but they are -- there may be partial funding or part of the equation. I think your comment is around confidence is something that I've touched on before and I believe that the confidence of having that blanket behind them along with generally what's been going on in the market is helpful for all the deals. We are seeing federal stimulus, when I talk about these few dozen deals, they are across different products of Tyler. I don't know that I would necessarily single out more than others. Although, there are some stimulus dollars that are specifically tied to schools. So, I think, generally it's a positive. It's something that's still a lot of our clients and prospective clients are -- there is still a lot of them still trying to figure out, how do we access them, which dollars are actually there and it's something that our marketing team in conjunction with our sales teams are putting together materials to help educate our clients and help navigate them where we can. But, yeah, it's a tailwind. Generally speaking, it's hard to quantify at this point. But, overall, I think, it's part of our -- it's part of the reason for optimism we have at Tyler. So I think you're right, we do have a lot of initiatives going on. We do have a lot of with larger portfolio than we did even three year, four years, five years ago. We are focused on. We did just spend over $2 billion on NIC. We're clearly focused on that. We're also clearly focused on our cloud initiatives and things that we need to do to continue to optimize our products and do some things with our internal operations as we move there. I've talked before about how we approach M&A generally and we've done a little bit this year. And I think earlier when we're talking about NIC, I said, we may go back to a couple of years ago, where we have a little bit of deliberate pause, we did a couple of other deals this year VendEngine, DataSpec. These were deals that were sort of in the works. I think though as we go into next year, we're going to remain opportunistic. We're going to continue to look at deals. I continue to look at deals today. I have been looking at deals over the last couple of months. Even though while we still have all this activity going on and when the right deal is out there. If it fits a need, whether it's small, medium or large, we will definitely still in the position to execute on that and then I would expect that we would. I didn't quite hear the question. Yeah. I think in the last -- there hasn't really been a change through COVID. We've been generally in maintenance agreements. We've targeted kind of in the 4% to 5% annual increases in on subscription renewals, targets are generally in that same range. And as you said the shortening the initial terms because those revenues are straight lined over the term of the agreement, gives us the opportunity to realize the benefit of those increases sooner. And generally we're leading with shorter terms and this quarter had success with that. Occasionally, particularly on some of the large contracts like I think back to the North Carolina courts injustice we have a 10-year agreement. So that can bounce around a bit. But we do prefer to have shorter agreements and the pricing has been in line with what we've historically tried to achieve. I'd say broadly it's pretty consistent. We have deals. These projects often our multiyear projects sometimes two years or three years, sometimes longer. Some of them are driven by legislated cycles in certain state like Indiana and Ohio that have regular cycles, where we have the almost like recurring appraisal projects. Others are more one-off. These three counties in Delaware that comprise all of Delaware that we're getting ready to start. It was a court-ordered reappraisal, so sometimes the courts get involved when it's determined that appraisals are out of date and maybe contributing to unfair distribution of taxes. So that's the case with these. And we are pretty uniquely positioned to be able to have a strong competitive position in those large deals and there's one-off kinds of deals, they can be a little bit lumpy, and but I'd say, we're generally in a -- at a range we're probably on a more active period right now, particularly coming out of COVID where some of these projects may have been delayed, but I wouldn't say it would be a step function, where there is a big step up. But we're doing really well in that business right now. Yeah. I think is -- I would say, my outlook is pretty optimistic. I will talk about Texas first, our payments business or their -- NIC payments business in Texas is one of our strong outperformance this quarter. When you talk about -- we mentioned Utah and we mentioned Oklahoma, these were early renewals. And part of that actually the reason for the early renewal was some of the excitement that's been generated through NIC with the customer about what the combined entity of Tyler and NIC can bring. We've talked about our Connected Communities Vision. We've talk about the different products and offerings that we can bring and I think both of these states were areas where they're seeing that future and they wanted to get -- they wanted to go ahead and jump in early, which gives me optimism for what I think we'll see going forward in the market. Great. Thanks, Jason, and thanks everybody for joining us today. We hope you stay safe and healthy and if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Have a good day everybody."

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, July 29, 2021.  I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Moore. Please go ahead.\nLynn Moore: Thank you, Andrew, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I'll have some preliminary comments on our quarter results, and then Brian will review the details. I'll end with some additional comments, and then we'll take questions. Brian?\nBrian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. During the course of this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. First, I want to provide you with an update on the NIC acquisition and our progress in the first 3 months post closing, and then we'll move on to a review of the quarter's results. As you know, we completed the acquisition of NIC during the second quarter on April 21st. With a purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion, this was by far our largest acquisition to date and our first acquisition of a public company. NIC is a leading provider of digital government solutions and payment processing that serves more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. We believe that the combination of NIC and Tyler provides tremendous opportunities for incremental growth in both businesses. The combined company is the public sector market leader for payment solutions and we plan to use NIC's robust payment platform to expand our local government payments business. We also have an opportunity to leverage NIC's strong relationships and state enterprise contracts to deliver Tyler solutions at the state level, including our MicroPact and Entellitrak platform. We discussed our vision for those opportunities on our Investor Call in early June. I'm extremely pleased with the progress we've made toward these objectives in the 3 months that NIC has been a part of Tyler. Our teams have prioritized our opportunities and are very engaged, working well together in a regular cadence. Our pre-acquisition impressions regarding the high degree of compatibility between the cultures of the 2 organizations have thus far proven to be accurate and leaders in both organizations have commented on how natural the combination feels. Our payments teams are working together and have been very encouraged as we learn more about each company's strengths and how complementary they are. As we noted on our June call, the state of Florida is a great example of the kind of opportunities we're pursuing. NIC is in the process of implementing a statewide payment processing solution for the state government in Florida. And the contract allows for local governments in the state, more than 400 of which are Tyler clients, to piggyback on that contract and we are actively pursuing those opportunities. For the last 2 months, we've also been conducting weekly showcases to familiarize NIC state enterprise managers with Tyler's broad portfolio of solutions and to surface opportunities in their states. We have already developed a growing joint pipeline that is generating active engagements with prospects in NIC states. And finally, our teams are actively working together to jointly establish the data and analytics platform for Connected Communities, leveraging our respective strengths, including our Socrata Data & Insights platform and NIC's Gov2Go Citizen portal. Together, NIC and Tyler can now provide the most expansive set of capabilities for citizens to interact with government at all levels. Turning to the quarter. NIC, like Tyler, had a very strong second quarter as they continue to benefit from the recovery from the pandemic with a growing demand for citizens and businesses to interact digitally with government. NIC also recorded higher than expected revenues from its tour health and pandemic unemployment initiatives, although those lower-margin revenues are currently expected to taper off in the second half of the year. Although NIC's results are only included in Tyler's consolidated financials from the date of the acquisition on April 21, for the full quarter, NIC's core revenues, excluding revenues from Tour Health and Pandemic Unemployment Initiatives, grew 23.5%. We're also very pleased to report that in late June, NIC was selected as 1 of 2 vendors to provide the Internal Revenue Service with a digital payment processing solution, which will allow individual and business taxpayers to securely pay their federal taxes. The contract has an initial 6-month term with 4 1-year renewal options and revenue under the contract is expected to begin in January of 2022. The actual revenue will be driven by the number of taxpayers who choose to pay online and who choose to use the NIC platform, and we expect to aggressively market our solution. We currently estimate annual gross revenue under the contract to be between $40 million and $60 million with annual net revenue of $5 million to $7 million after interchange and merchant fees. This contract significantly expands NIC's payment processing at the federal level and underscores the strength of NIC's platform and leadership in public sector payments. Moving on to our consolidated results. Our second quarter was very strong, reflecting the inclusion of the results of NIC from April 21 with both core Tyler and NIC operations exceeding expectations. Total revenues grew 49.1% driven by the inclusion of NIC, as well as the acceleration of Tyler's organic growth to 12.4%. Recurring revenues comprised 79% of our second quarter revenues and were led by 133% growth in subscription revenues with the inclusion of NIC. Excluding NIC revenues, subscription revenue growth was robust at 24%. Software licenses and services revenues also rebounded from the low point in last year's second quarter, growing 17% or 7.6%, excluding NIC. As expected, our margins were down compared to second quarter last year as some costs and lower margin revenues, like billable travel, that declined in 2020 due to COVID pandemic began to return. Margins were also impacted by the inclusion of NIC and particularly by the continuation of their lower-margin COVID-related revenues. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 100 basis points to 26.5%. Bookings in the second quarter grew 50% to approximately $464 million with the inclusion of NIC. Excluding NIC, bookings rose 17.5%. Our largest deal in the quarter was a combination license and SaaS arrangement with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies valued at approximately $9.3 million for our Entellitrak regulatory, Socrata Data & Insights, and SceneDoc Mobile Field Inspection Solutions, as well as NIC's electronic payment solution. And all those solutions will be hosted in AWS. This deal is a great example of our ability to add value by offering multiple Tyler products, many of which came from recent acquisitions, into a single deal, enhancing the competitiveness of solutions like Entellitrak. We also signed a large public safety license contract with the Lake County Sheriffs office in Illinois for our CAD, RMS, Mobile, Field Reporting, Brazos e-citation, Soft Code Process Service and Socrata Data & Insight solutions valued at approximately $4.1 million. In addition, we signed 4 other license deals across multiple product suites, each with contract values greater than $1 million. SaaS contracts represented 65% of our new contract software value in the second quarter. Our largest SaaS contract was a 5-year deal with Dubuque, Iowa, for our Munis ERP and EnerGov Civic Services Solutions valued at approximately $4.6 million. We also signed SaaS contracts for our Munis ERP solution with Charles County, Maryland, valued at approximately $4 million; and DeSoto, Texas valued at approximately $3.5 million. We also signed a SaaS deal for our Tyler Supervision Solution with Riverside County, California, valued at approximately $3.3 million. This is the largest deal to date for our Supervision product, which came to Tyler through the acquisition of CaseloadPRO, a little less than 3 years ago. And in fact, the value of the single contract is greater than the total annual revenues of that business when we acquired it. In addition, we signed 9 other SaaS arrangements during the quarter, each with a total contract value of greater than $1 million. In addition to the IRS payment processing contract, during the second quarter, NIC signed extensions of its state enterprise contracts for digital government and payment processing services with the states of Oregon and Idaho. NIC also signed a 5-year SaaS agreement for its RXGov prescription drug monitoring program solution with the province of New Brunswick, Canada, marking the first international deployment for that solution. We're pleased to see the increased market activity and trends that reflect our markets are rebounding back toward pre-COVID levels. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter.\nBrian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021. Note that the results of DataSpec and ReadySub, which were acquired on March 31st, are included in our consolidated results for the full quarter and the results of NIC are included in our results from the date of acquisition, April 21st. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results in comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $404.1 million, up 49.1%. Non-GAAP revenues were $405.4 million, up 49.4%. On an organic basis, GAAP and non-GAAP revenues grew 12.4% and 12.3%, respectively. Software license revenues rose 3.4%. Subscription revenues rose 133%. Excluding the contribution from NIC, subscription revenues were still very strong, growing 24%. We added 170 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 62 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. In Q2 of last year, we added 125 new subscription-based arrangements and had 42 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $39 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 65% of total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 43% in Q2 of last year, as we continued our shift to a cloud first approach to sales. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter were 4.1 years, compared to 3.7 last year.  Transaction based revenues, which include NIC portal revenues, payment processing and e-filing are included in subscriptions -- and are included in subscriptions, were $119.6 million, up 463%. That amount includes e-filing revenues of $16.3 million, up 14.5%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 24.1%.  For the second quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $1.3 billion, up 58.2%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements for Q2 was approximately $325 million, up 25.9%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $479 million, up 463% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $478 million, up 2.4%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.63 billion, up 5.6%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction based, their backlog at quarter end was only $21 million. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were very robust at $464 million, up 50.1% and includes the transaction-based revenues of NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were strong at approximately $364 million, up 17.5%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.3 billion, up 9.6%. And on an organic basis, were approximately $1.2 billion, up 1.3%. Our software subscription bookings in the second quarter added $15 million in new annual recurring revenue. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both negative in the second quarter as Q2 included approximately $19 million of acquisition-related costs. In addition, cash from operations and free cash flow were negatively impacted by the timing of cash collections by NIC on behalf of government agencies prior to the close of the acquisition and remittances to the agency's post acquisition. This is purely a timing difference and will normalize in future quarters. Our balance sheet remains very strong. During the quarter, we paid down $185 million of the debt incurred under our revolver in connection with the acquisition. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.565 billion and cash and investments of $380.9 million. Since the end of the quarter, we have repaid an additional $52 million on the revolver. And today, we have outstanding $1.513 billion of debt with a blended stated interest rate of 1.01%. We have raised our revenue and EPS guidance for the full year of 2021, which is as follows. We expect 2021 GAAP total revenues will be between $1.532 billion and $1.557 billion and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.535 billion and $1.560 billion. We expect total revenues will include approximately $32 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's Tour Health and Pandemic Unemployment Services that are not expected to recur in future years. We expect 2021 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.68 and $3.81 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $6.70 and $6.80. Interest expense for the year is expected to be approximately $23 million and includes approximately $11 million of amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. For the year, pretax noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $102 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be between $94 million and $96 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 42 million and 42.5 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of negative 2% after discrete tax items and includes approximately $46 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. Our estimated non-GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2021 is 24%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be between $48 million and $50 million for the year, including approximately $10 million related to real estate and approximately $22 million of capitalized software development costs. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $126 million, including approximately $89 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. As you can see, our team of professionals, including our new team members at NIC, DataSpec and ReadySub, executed at a very high level in the second quarter, driving results that surpassed expectations. As I've said before, I'm extremely proud of how our team members have responded to the challenges in the last 1.5 years with incredible grit, grace and resilience. And we're proud that Tyler has recently been named a Best Place to Work by publications in Washington, D.C., Colorado and Mississippi, joining several other locations where Tyler has received similar awards. We've continued to invest in, and in some cases, accelerate all of our long-term strategic initiatives, in particular, our shift to a cloud-first approach with a focus on optimizing our products for the cloud and transitioning SaaS deployments from Tyler data centers to AWS. As a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. We continue to see indications that our market is returning to normal, as many delayed procurement processes are moving forward and new processes are starting. RFPs and sales activities such as demos are trending toward, and in some cases, exceeding pre-COVID levels. While not a significant factor in Q2, we expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments and $167 billion of aid schools under the American Rescue Plan Act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects and potentially provide a tailwind over the next 2 to 3 years.  With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson.\nPeterHeckmann: Great to see a very strong quarter for both Tyler and EGOV right out of the box. Congratulations on the IRS win. Just curious, the -- if I'm looking at it correctly, the annual guide, which you just gave in June, but it didn't go up as much as the relative beat in the quarter. There's some elements in the quarter that were maybe more onetime in nature or was it affected just by the timing of the close of NIC versus your original expectations? Or do you think that there's something that we should be thinking about for the back half in terms of margins?\nLynnMoore: Well, the -- I'd say one of the factors certainly is that we've increased the expectation around the amount of revenues, certainly both in this quarter and continuing on into the third quarter around the COVID-related services that NIC is providing. Those have gone on a little bit longer. We expect they'd wrap up really in the second quarter and those are continuing on into the second half of the year. So that's part of the factor around the second quarter outperforming on the revenue side, but not expecting to see that same bump in the second half of the year. Otherwise, we took up the guidance a bit. But typically, by the -- in the second quarter, we're not looking to raise numbers quite a bit until we have better visibility around the second half.\nPeterHeckmann: Okay. Okay. And then just -- again, congrats on the IRS contract. That's a pretty good-sized deal and -- but do you believe it will be -- will you be recording it gross or net?\nLynnMoore: That's expected to be growth accounting. We're the merchant of record there, and we'll be responsible for the merchant and interchange fees. So it's a higher revenue number, but lower margin.\nPeterHeckmann: Lower margin. So on a gross basis, maybe margins come through at high single digits or so?\nLynnMoore: Yes. I mean if we're we're looking at -- we said sort of between $40 million and $60 million in revenues and the net revenue number kind of in the $5 million to $7 million range.\nBrianMiller: Yes, Pete, of their larger contracts, IRS and Texas are -- will be on a gross basis. Florida will be on a net basis when those revenues kick up starting late this year and really going into next year.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt VanVliet with BTIG.\nMattVanVliet: Congrats on the quarter. Lynn, I guess, in part of your closing you mentioned that significant amount of stimulus funds sort of still available to local governments in particular. But curious in terms of what you're hearing. A lot of that recently reported as being unspent and people looking at what kind of time duration that might actually entail. Curious how much of that is sort of inspiring some of this uptick in RFPs and sales activity? And then conversely, has any of the delays in the proposed infrastructure bill put a little bit of a pause in some of these as those governments look to see kind of what else might be coming before they spend some of these funds now?\nBrianMiller: Yes, Matt. I think I probably read the same general editorial yesterday about the -- some of the unspent funds from the American Rescue Plan. I don't know that -- I think what it's done is it's provided confidence. We've talked before, the reality is that the impact of budgets was a lot less severe than before. Those funds are still sitting there. Some of those funds do have some timing elements with respect to when they need to be spent. And some of that is still TBD. I think when you're seeing the more releases in RFPs, the things that we're seeing in the market, the more demos, the activity picking up. I mean, in some parts of our business really to pre-COVID levels, some just almost getting back to pre-COVID levels. I think a function of that, too, is just the general sentiment and mood out there. I think the American Rescue Plan provides that confidence. We're also, as you know, most of our clients are now in a new budget year. And I think with those expectations for more funding, they saw the real impact to their budgets from last year were not as severe. And I think just -- I think some of that's coming back. And I think you've just also highlight what we've talked about throughout the last 1.5 years is that the demand for what we do doesn't go away. It's going to be pent-up. And so we're starting to see that. So at a high level, that's what I'd say. And on the delays on the infrastructure bill, I don't know that that's really going to have much of an impact on what we see in terms of bids and RFPs in our day-to-day business.\nLynnMoore: I'd add, the American Rescue Plan, they've got until the end of 2024 to spend that. In fact, they just are getting the first half this year and the second half a year from now of those funds. So there's still a lot of allocations and determinations within these governments around how they're going to spend that money. So as we said in the prepared remarks, we really haven't seen much of an impact in terms of new deals and things that are of a significant size that are specifically tied to those funds. Most of the activity we're seeing today is more around the recovery of the -- or the resumption of some of those delayed processes and things that would have taken place in the last year otherwise.\nMattVanVliet: All right. Very helpful. And then following up on a number of deals that you announced with, I guess, both legacy Tyler and NIC products. So congrats on that. But just curious in terms of sort of an update of where you're at in terms of the full integration of the sales teams, the go-to-market mechanism. Are you just starting to get to some of that, and we can see more of these deals coming through? Or do you think there's already been a lot of progress, and it's just more of getting through sales cycles from here forward?\nLynnMoore: Are you talking specifically with the NIC integration?\nMattVanVliet: Yes, the integration of the go-to-market for NIC into legacy Tyler.\nLynnMoore: Yes. So the integration is going well. We talked about it on our -- I think it was our June update call. We've got a lot of excitement. We have -- our priorities, though, we really want to make sure that they -- we don't do anything to mess up the business. We make their plan, retain their staff, identify these initiatives, get the sales teams aligned and we're doing that. Obviously, Harry Herington, their founder, he decided to retire. One of the key things that we first had to do was establish new leadership. We've done that. Elizabeth Proudfit's now leading that division. She's been with NIC for over 20 years and been responsible for selling most of their major state enterprise contracts, including Florida. As I mentioned in my comments, we've hit the ground running. Our Tyler teams are showcasing products really 2 to 3 a week with all of their state GMs. Our payments teams have gotten together and working on Tyler technology integration plans, talking about how we can leverage NIC relationships. I guess I'd say all that stuff is -- it's active. It's going on. The excitement continues to be there. I'll echo my comments from back in June, balancing expectations. If you've been around a long time, these things take time. But the excitement is there. And we are seeing and identifying joint opportunities. It takes a while for those to come to fruition. But like I said, every time our teams meet, the excitement only continues to grow.\nOperator: The next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham & Company.\nScottBerg: Lynn and Brian, congrats on a good quarter. I guess 2 probably simple ones. The first question is on just general deal flow from the core Tyler side when you talked about how things seem to be normalizing more towards prepandemic levels, the volume of deal flow certainly speaks to that in the quarter. I guess my question there, is that more just pent-up demand that's flowing out? Or are you seeing a true normalization maybe of those sales cycles in the last quarter or two? And then my second question, Brian, is on your guidance for the year. The non I guess, ongoing revenues from the Tour Health and the Pandemic side from NIC was increased from $21 million to $32 million for the year. Did that mean the overall NIC contribution for the year went up that much? Or is it just maybe a shift in revenues within your expected contribution from that business?\nLynnMoore: Thanks, Scott. I'll start. And I'd say it's a little bit of both. Q2 last year was a slow year. And we talked about it in the last couple of earnings calls, about how the impact was really felt a little bit differently across different parts of our business. But what we're starting to see now is that the number of RFPs are up significantly from Q2 a year ago, up over 50%. Trade shows are returning. Our unsigned selections, which we don't talk about a lot. Those are up significantly. The number of new deals, as you pointed out, that we signed this quarter was, I think, up over 30% from a year ago. When you look at areas like where I talked about the last few quarters, where we saw a little bit more slowdown was more in our high-end financials, our Munis and our EnerGov solutions. We're certainly seeing the momentum growing there. I think Q4 was probably a low in those areas for RFPs and selections. And those are up significantly. And remember, those types of deals, they generally take about 3 quarters from RFP to close. So there will continue to be a lag as we're seeing these RFPs come up, but that's continuing other places like our lower-end financials, our in code. I think RFPs now are actually back to 2019 levels. So it's there. It's a combination of pent-up demand, but also just the market returning.\nBrianMiller: And on the NIC COVID-related revenues, yes, that increase in our estimate of what those revenues will be for the year and the increase in what was actually recorded in the second quarter is -- was added to NIC's revenue. So that's incremental to our estimates that we previously had for their full year revenues. Unfortunately, with some of the resurgence of COVID and the Delta variant, there's more of a need for testing for a longer period with some of our clients than we had previously expected. And some of those agreements have been extended beyond when we expected that they would roll off. We still expect that they will taper down in the third quarter and pretty minimal revenues from those in the fourth quarter.\nScottBerg: Excellent. Congrats again.\nOperator: The next question comes from Charlie Strauzer with CJS Securities.\nCharlieStrauzer: Lynn, if you could kind of talk a little bit more about the pipeline and length of the sales cycle, is that shrinking at all? And are you seeing a pickup at all in prospective clients from the rash of cyberattacks that have been in the news lately?\nLynnMoore: First, I'm not sure I heard all that. The first question was about the pipeline. The pipeline is -- I think across all our major core apps, the pipeline is certainly returning. I don't know that it's -- I think there are parts of our business where it's back to full pre-COVID levels and in some cases exceeding, some places, it's approaching there. So all the signs right now out there, all the leading indicators that we talk about, demos and trade shows are coming back, RFPs being released, deals without RFPs. Those are all up significantly sequentially quarter and significant year-over-year. So that's significant. And the second question was about -- I didn't quite catch the second question. Could you just repeat the second one?\nCharlieStrauzer: Yes, just with the rash of cyber attacks in the news, have you seen any pickup in the inquiries from your clients about maybe moving to the cloud more rapidly than they may have thought before?\nLynnMoore: It's a good question. I think it's just all part of the overall equation. I think the increase that we've seen, I talked earlier about our financial solutions, Munis and Encode. I mean our new deals there are 85%, 90% SaaS. A couple of years ago, it was more like in the 50% range. I think it's just -- I think that's just a piece of the puzzle. I don't know that there's anything specific around some of those cyber security things, but security is a big part of it. But I think it's that, coupled with COVID, coupled with just the general direction the market had been moving over the last several years.\nBrianMiller: This was a pretty good margin, the largest quarter we've ever had for flips or customers moving or existing customers moving from on-premises to the cloud as well. And that's one of the factors, I think. Not the sole factor, but a factor in that desire of customers to move to our cloud solution.\nCharlieStrauzer: Interesting. And then Brian, if you could just -- looking at the guidance a little bit, if you can give us a little bit more clarity as to how we should think about the cadence of the next few quarters? Just kind of help us plot that a little bit better.\nBrianMiller: Yes. The second half of the year, obviously, will include -- we only had a partial quarter of NIC. So obviously, we grow in the second half from that. But I'd say, generally, we would expect -- and also with the trailing off of the NIC COVID-related revenues in Q4, I think we'll see both of those quarters above, obviously, the second quarter level. But the third quarter will likely be our highest revenue quarter and a bit of a drop-off from Q3 to Q4 as the COVID business rolls off. So Q3 is likely to being the highest quarter in terms of both revenues and EPS. So there's a little bit different. Generally, our fourth quarter is the highest, but there's somewhat of an anomaly there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird.\nRobOliver: Great. Lynn, I'll start with one for you. You've cited the Colorado $9 million win, which included Entellitrak and NIC on AWS. That's kind of a great signature win there. And I'm just curious if you can maybe to a extent that you can walk us through a little bit. Was that -- I assume that was the Tyler contract in Origin, was NIC added on throughout the quarter? Maybe talk about some of the dynamics there. It seems like a nice template for pretty nice, meaningful subscription win here very early in the combination between the 2? And then I had a follow-up question as well.\nLynnMoore: Yes, that's right, Rob. This is a Tyler contract from the get-go, and it was it really emanated from our -- the MicroPact acquisition, our Tyler Federal business. MicroPact had relationships with NIC even prior to our deal. And so it would not be unusual for them to have been in deals together. And so having them part of that is, as you say, it's a nice round out.  It also -- I think it highlights -- when we talk about a lot of these large deals, and I mentioned it in my remarks. And it really highlights the value of our acquisition strategy over the years. I mean, when you talk about -- that's a deal that -- it's our largest deal of the quarter. Well, that's our entellitrak that came from MicroPact. It includes Socrata, another recent acquisition, SceneDoc, the NIC payments. It includes our strategic alliance with AWS. It is kind of a showcase deal for the quarter. And again, I think, validates our acquisition strategy and how it plays in the market even as it may take time for us to sort of build up and get these larger contracts that really put us in a competitive position that makes it difficult for others to compete with.\nRobOliver: Great. That's helpful. And then I just had a follow-up. I mean, you guys have been pretty clear that payments is really the area where you're kind of leading in terms of -- I don't want to say low-hanging fruit, because obviously it's not easy, but where you're kind of like leading the charge in terms of the integration. You did make a comment, I believe, Lynn, about the Florida master limited -- well, the Florida opportunity. And I know that with NIC sitting on 28 master enterprise contracts. Just curious for any early color or indications around receptivity towards kind of the products being sold in there. And I know also those states are being recipients of some funds now. So just curious for any color around that.\nBrianMiller: No, that's a good point, Rob. And you're right. We talk a lot about payments, primarily because that was a big strategic initiative for Tyler before we even started talking with NIC. And what's interesting there is just how our -- as our teams get together, how complementary our products are and how the things that was on Tyler's development road map were things that really NIC had already not just done but perfected and things that Tyler had already had with their systems or things that NIC needed to do. But you're right, beyond payments, we talk about that a lot. But one of the things that makes us really excited is the ability to sell Tyler products through those state contracts and really leverage those NIC relationships. I mean, they've got very deep relationships at the highest levels of state government areas where really Tyler just didn't have access. And I'm talking about governors and senior decision makers. And you get in front of those people and we're able to get in front of those people and try to talk to them about what are you guys trying to get done, what policies are you pursuing, and whether it's economic development or HHS or prison reform or whatever it is, and we've got the solutions to do it. And that's really the crux of what we're doing with these weekly showcases with Tyler products. We have to educate all of these state -- the state GMs and the entire NIC executive team as to what our portfolio is really all about and how we can leverage that. And I don't want to minimize that because we talk a lot about payments, but that is something that we see as significant upside.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company.\nJonathanHo: Congratulations on the strong quarter. I just wanted to maybe dig into some of the billable travel or some of the lower-margin revenue that returned this quarter. Is there a way for you to maybe quantify for us maybe how much has returned and maybe what you expect in terms of, I guess, the rest of the year in terms of how that will come back?\nBrianMiller: Yes. I don't have the number in front of me for billable travel. It's not significant. It's still well under what we typically did, which was about $5 million a quarter pre-COVID. It's probably on the order of 20% of that has come back. But it's come back a little sooner than we expected, just as we're starting to see employees coming back to the offices. Our customers are starting to want to see our salespeople and our implementation people in some instances back on site, and we still expect that we'll continue in most cases to deliver the majority of our implementation services remotely. There is a desire in an increasing number of customers to see people back on site. And so that's picked up even a little bit sooner than we expected. But certainly, well under half of what it was pre-COVID. Public safety is probably one of those areas because the -- our clients never went home. The first responders and -- those agencies continue to work, and so they're ready to have us back on site as well. So we're seeing a bit of that come back, but still well under the pre-COVID levels.\nLynnMoore: Yes. And Jonathan, we're also -- we're doing things to try to incentivize more remote delivery of service as well in terms of pricing and things like that. And I think we're still trying to feel it out, as Brian said. The expectation is we will not go back to pre-COVID levels. There are parts of our business that really sort of still demand on site, as Brian mentioned, public safety. But on the others, we're going to work with our clients and working in different ways to try to bring that down.\nJonathanHo: And then just in terms of trying to understand a little bit better the advantages of some of the statewide acquisition contracts that you've signed. Can you maybe help us understand how Tyler can leverage those contracts? And maybe what the advantages of having those contracts over a traditional RFP process? What can you do with those that you couldn't do before? And what does that sort of make easier in the contracting process?\nLynnMoore: So you're talking about the NIC state contracts?\nJonathanHo: Yes.\nLynnMoore: Yes. So it's a couple of things. I mean those contracts that -- NIC has done an amazing job over the years. It takes them a little bit longer, but really of establishing contracts that are extremely open-ended and as we like to use the term hunting licenses. And so it allows those -- under those contracts to pursue a lot of different opportunities with a lot of different agencies and in some cases, even local jurisdictions. It allows them to push products. But more importantly, too, it also -- what they also bring is, as I just mentioned, is their deep relationships with different agencies and different higher execs at the state level, areas that where Tyler just didn't have any exposure. And so it's leveraging those relationships, leveraging Tyler's products, leveraging those open-ended contracts, really creates a whole new opportunity for Tyler that we've never seen before. An example would be we're having discussions with a particular state with some court solutions. And we're actually able to have conversations at an extremely high level at a place where Tyler traditionally just had not been able to do it. And those relationships are coming from those state contracts.  And I mentioned the state of Oregon and the State of Idaho as renewals for NIC. And what's important there is the Oregon contract, that's an extension, but that's an extension of a 10-year relationship. The Idaho contract is a 2-year extension on a 22-year relationship. So these are very deep relationships that NIC has done. Getting these renewals is something you don't take for granted, and you've got to continue to deliver value. And I think the flip side of that is what Tyler can bring is, as we continue to leverage those relationships and put more products, it will actually bring that more value to those contracts and further deepen those relationships so that those will continue to sustain and survive well into the future.\nOperator: The next question comes from Keith Housum with North Coast Research.\nKeithHousum: Just two questions for you. One on the IRS contract. I think I heard you say there's -- you're 1 of 2 vendors that have been picked. Can you perhaps provide more color, are you guys splitting the revenue and the payment process here? Or is there an opportunity to perhaps to expand that down the road?\nLynnMoore: Yes. So you're right. So they went with 2 providers. No, it's not a partnership. What will be chosen is by the actual citizen or business who chooses to pay. It's not unlike there are certain areas with our e-filing where there we may be the -- there may be multiple people who are providing that service even though the back end is through Tyler. We'll be marketing and doing what we can, we'll be trying to provide the best service. What's interesting, though, is that prior to this contract, they had actually -- I think they had 4 vendors, none of which were selected here. There are 3 vendors. And both of us and the other vendor were new selections by the IRS.\nKeithHousum: Great. Congratulations. And then looking at the NIC growth, obviously, that was a strong quarter for those guys. Was it more transactional based or would they -- are they having success with the platforms that they were developing prior to your purchase, the payments and the recreational elections and such?\nLynnMoore: Yes. So I think they had -- as you mentioned, a really great quarter. I think the revenue was up around 19%. And really, they really outperformed in a couple of areas. Their state enterprise transaction revenue, which includes payments and also their outdoor licensing, their recreation.gov as more and more people are getting outdoors, it's just -- it's up significantly over a year ago. Obviously, we also mentioned the COVID-related services continue to outperform even as we expect those to taper off. But yes, it's that state enterprise transaction revenue related payments, outdoor licensing and COVID.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI.\nKirkMaterne: All right. Lynn, can you just give us an update on how it's going in terms of moving more of your products over to AWS at this point in time. When do you think you can have maybe a plurality of products running on AWS and some of the benefits to the business model from them? I'm just trying to get a sense on how far along we are on that front.\nLynnMoore: I'd say we're still in the early innings there. The expectation for me is, across our business lines, as we get into the second half of the year, we're going to start putting new clients there. We've still been over the last year, still been validating really sort of some of the costs. It's a project we call Lighthouse where we've got -- we're taking existing clients across all of our core apps and we're putting them in AWS, running them and verifying the costs and seeing -- obviously, we're doing things already to make changes to our products to make them run more efficient in AWS, but this also helps provide a road map. And I think as you see going into next year, you're going to continue to see movement of new business into AWS because the goal is to eventually move out of 2 Tyler data centers to 1. So we're going to need to start bringing that down. We'll start with new business and then we will probably start accelerating our -- we've already been accelerating our flips, but at some point, put together a more robust migration for existing. But I'd say, overall, we're still in the early innings. And I think we'd probably be in a more better position to report on that kind of progress really starting next year.\nKirkMaterne: That's great. And then, Brian, just as sort of a point of clarification. I know you don't want to get anything '22 related at this point in time. But is it safe -- should we just be zeroing out the COVID-related revenue from NIC for '22 at this point in time? Is that sort of the -- what you would advise us as we start thinking ahead to next year? I know you don't want to give anything formal, but it seems like that revenue is going to be pretty immaterial next year.\nBrianMiller: Yes, that's our expectation now, that there won't be anything there next year.\nLynnMoore: And to be honest, Kirk, that's my hope because that means that COVID is going away.\nKirkMaterne: Me, too. So it's all over [Indiscernible] All right. Congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: And we have a follow-up from Matt VanVliet with BTIG.\nMattVanVliet: Brian, just one quick follow-up. You mentioned the cash flow impact from some of the previously collected but then remitted funds for NIC post close. Could you just give us a sense for the magnitude there and how much it actually impacted cash flow in the quarter?\nBrianMiller: Yes, that was about $55 million, how much the reduction from the liability we had on the books for funds payable to clients, how much that went down from the time of acquisition to the end of the quarter. So pretty significant impact. That's just money that's passing through. So over the course of a longer period of time, that impact is 0. It comes in and goes out. But just the timing of it relative to what was on their balance sheet at the time of the acquisition and paid shortly afterwards, ran through our cash flow statement to the tune of about $55 million.\nLynnMoore: Yes, the gross versus net payments primarily, which also impacts margins.\nBrianMiller: Yes. Passing through us.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Goodwin with JMP Securities.\nJoeGoodwin: Congrats on the quarter. Just a quick question on the master contracts. Great to see the renewals come through. But I guess now that NIC is combined with Tyler, does that motion of actually securing net new contracts or just new contracts with these states changed at all? Any commentary there would be great.\nLynnMoore: I don't think there's a fundamental change in that process. And like I said, what I believe will happen over time is NIC, as I said, they've done a great job of building these relationships. These are all very long-term relationships. They got to continue to deliver value. And what I think will happen over time is that as Tyler is able to enhance that value, it will only -- I think it will only help to facilitate those renewals in the future.\nOperator: At this time, there appear to be no more questions, Mr. Moore. So I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nLynn Moore: Great. Thanks, Andrew, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We certainly hope you stay safe and healthy, and if you have any further questions or follow-up, please feel free to reach out to Brian Miller or myself. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2021. Note that the results of DataSpec and ReadySub, which were acquired on March 31st, are included in our consolidated results for the full quarter and the results of NIC are included in our results from the date of acquisition, April 21st. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results in comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. GAAP revenues for the quarter were $404.1 million, up 49.1%. Non-GAAP revenues were $405.4 million, up 49.4%. On an organic basis, GAAP and non-GAAP revenues grew 12.4% and 12.3%, respectively. Software license revenues rose 3.4%. Subscription revenues rose 133%. Excluding the contribution from NIC, subscription revenues were still very strong, growing 24%. We added 170 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 62 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. In Q2 of last year, we added 125 new subscription-based arrangements and had 42 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $39 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 65% of total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 43% in Q2 of last year, as we continued our shift to a cloud first approach to sales. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter were 4.1 years, compared to 3.7 last year.  Transaction based revenues, which include NIC portal revenues, payment processing and e-filing are included in subscriptions -- and are included in subscriptions, were $119.6 million, up 463%. That amount includes e-filing revenues of $16.3 million, up 14.5%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 24.1%.  For the second quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $1.3 billion, up 58.2%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements for Q2 was approximately $325 million, up 25.9%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $479 million, up 463% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $478 million, up 2.4%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.63 billion, up 5.6%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction based, their backlog at quarter end was only $21 million. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were very robust at $464 million, up 50.1% and includes the transaction-based revenues of NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were strong at approximately $364 million, up 17.5%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.3 billion, up 9.6%. And on an organic basis, were approximately $1.2 billion, up 1.3%. Our software subscription bookings in the second quarter added $15 million in new annual recurring revenue. Cash from operations and free cash flow were both negative in the second quarter as Q2 included approximately $19 million of acquisition-related costs. In addition, cash from operations and free cash flow were negatively impacted by the timing of cash collections by NIC on behalf of government agencies prior to the close of the acquisition and remittances to the agency's post acquisition. This is purely a timing difference and will normalize in future quarters. Our balance sheet remains very strong. During the quarter, we paid down $185 million of the debt incurred under our revolver in connection with the acquisition. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.565 billion and cash and investments of $380.9 million. Since the end of the quarter, we have repaid an additional $52 million on the revolver. And today, we have outstanding $1.513 billion of debt with a blended stated interest rate of 1.01%. We have raised our revenue and EPS guidance for the full year of 2021, which is as follows. We expect 2021 GAAP total revenues will be between $1.532 billion and $1.557 billion and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.535 billion and $1.560 billion. We expect total revenues will include approximately $32 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's Tour Health and Pandemic Unemployment Services that are not expected to recur in future years. We expect 2021 GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.68 and $3.81 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $6.70 and $6.80. Interest expense for the year is expected to be approximately $23 million and includes approximately $11 million of amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. For the year, pretax noncash share-based compensation expense is expected to be approximately $102 million. We expect R&D expense for the year will be between $94 million and $96 million. Fully diluted shares for the year are expected to be between 42 million and 42.5 million shares. GAAP earnings per share assumes an estimated annual effective tax rate of negative 2% after discrete tax items and includes approximately $46 million of estimated discrete tax benefits related to share-based compensation, which may vary significantly based on the timing and volume of stock option exercises. Our estimated non-GAAP annual effective tax rate for 2021 is 24%. We expect our total capital expenditures will be between $48 million and $50 million for the year, including approximately $10 million related to real estate and approximately $22 million of capitalized software development costs. Total depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately $126 million, including approximately $89 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn. Yes, Pete, of their larger contracts, IRS and Texas are -- will be on a gross basis. Florida will be on a net basis when those revenues kick up starting late this year and really going into next year. Yes, Matt. I think I probably read the same general editorial yesterday about the -- some of the unspent funds from the American Rescue Plan. I don't know that -- I think what it's done is it's provided confidence. We've talked before, the reality is that the impact of budgets was a lot less severe than before. Those funds are still sitting there. Some of those funds do have some timing elements with respect to when they need to be spent. And some of that is still TBD. I think when you're seeing the more releases in RFPs, the things that we're seeing in the market, the more demos, the activity picking up. I mean, in some parts of our business really to pre-COVID levels, some just almost getting back to pre-COVID levels. I think a function of that, too, is just the general sentiment and mood out there. I think the American Rescue Plan provides that confidence. We're also, as you know, most of our clients are now in a new budget year. And I think with those expectations for more funding, they saw the real impact to their budgets from last year were not as severe. And I think just -- I think some of that's coming back. And I think you've just also highlight what we've talked about throughout the last 1.5 years is that the demand for what we do doesn't go away. It's going to be pent-up. And so we're starting to see that. So at a high level, that's what I'd say. And on the delays on the infrastructure bill, I don't know that that's really going to have much of an impact on what we see in terms of bids and RFPs in our day-to-day business. And on the NIC COVID-related revenues, yes, that increase in our estimate of what those revenues will be for the year and the increase in what was actually recorded in the second quarter is -- was added to NIC's revenue. So that's incremental to our estimates that we previously had for their full year revenues. Unfortunately, with some of the resurgence of COVID and the Delta variant, there's more of a need for testing for a longer period with some of our clients than we had previously expected. And some of those agreements have been extended beyond when we expected that they would roll off. We still expect that they will taper down in the third quarter and pretty minimal revenues from those in the fourth quarter. This was a pretty good margin, the largest quarter we've ever had for flips or customers moving or existing customers moving from on-premises to the cloud as well. And that's one of the factors, I think. Not the sole factor, but a factor in that desire of customers to move to our cloud solution. Yes. The second half of the year, obviously, will include -- we only had a partial quarter of NIC. So obviously, we grow in the second half from that. But I'd say, generally, we would expect -- and also with the trailing off of the NIC COVID-related revenues in Q4, I think we'll see both of those quarters above, obviously, the second quarter level. But the third quarter will likely be our highest revenue quarter and a bit of a drop-off from Q3 to Q4 as the COVID business rolls off. So Q3 is likely to being the highest quarter in terms of both revenues and EPS. So there's a little bit different. Generally, our fourth quarter is the highest, but there's somewhat of an anomaly there. No, that's a good point, Rob. And you're right. We talk a lot about payments, primarily because that was a big strategic initiative for Tyler before we even started talking with NIC. And what's interesting there is just how our -- as our teams get together, how complementary our products are and how the things that was on Tyler's development road map were things that really NIC had already not just done but perfected and things that Tyler had already had with their systems or things that NIC needed to do. But you're right, beyond payments, we talk about that a lot. But one of the things that makes us really excited is the ability to sell Tyler products through those state contracts and really leverage those NIC relationships. I mean, they've got very deep relationships at the highest levels of state government areas where really Tyler just didn't have access. And I'm talking about governors and senior decision makers. And you get in front of those people and we're able to get in front of those people and try to talk to them about what are you guys trying to get done, what policies are you pursuing, and whether it's economic development or HHS or prison reform or whatever it is, and we've got the solutions to do it. And that's really the crux of what we're doing with these weekly showcases with Tyler products. We have to educate all of these state -- the state GMs and the entire NIC executive team as to what our portfolio is really all about and how we can leverage that. And I don't want to minimize that because we talk a lot about payments, but that is something that we see as significant upside. Yes. I don't have the number in front of me for billable travel. It's not significant. It's still well under what we typically did, which was about $5 million a quarter pre-COVID. It's probably on the order of 20% of that has come back. But it's come back a little sooner than we expected, just as we're starting to see employees coming back to the offices. Our customers are starting to want to see our salespeople and our implementation people in some instances back on site, and we still expect that we'll continue in most cases to deliver the majority of our implementation services remotely. There is a desire in an increasing number of customers to see people back on site. And so that's picked up even a little bit sooner than we expected. But certainly, well under half of what it was pre-COVID. Public safety is probably one of those areas because the -- our clients never went home. The first responders and -- those agencies continue to work, and so they're ready to have us back on site as well. So we're seeing a bit of that come back, but still well under the pre-COVID levels. Yes, that's our expectation now, that there won't be anything there next year. Yes, that was about $55 million, how much the reduction from the liability we had on the books for funds payable to clients, how much that went down from the time of acquisition to the end of the quarter. So pretty significant impact. That's just money that's passing through. So over the course of a longer period of time, that impact is 0. It comes in and goes out. But just the timing of it relative to what was on their balance sheet at the time of the acquisition and paid shortly afterwards, ran through our cash flow statement to the tune of about $55 million. Yes. Passing through us."

            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the Safe Harbor statement. Next, I'll have some preliminary comments on our quarter results, and then Brian will review the details. I'll end with some additional comments, and then we'll take questions. Brian? Thanks, Brian. First, I want to provide you with an update on the NIC acquisition and our progress in the first 3 months post closing, and then we'll move on to a review of the quarter's results. As you know, we completed the acquisition of NIC during the second quarter on April 21st. With a purchase price of approximately $2.3 billion, this was by far our largest acquisition to date and our first acquisition of a public company. NIC is a leading provider of digital government solutions and payment processing that serves more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. We believe that the combination of NIC and Tyler provides tremendous opportunities for incremental growth in both businesses. The combined company is the public sector market leader for payment solutions and we plan to use NIC's robust payment platform to expand our local government payments business. We also have an opportunity to leverage NIC's strong relationships and state enterprise contracts to deliver Tyler solutions at the state level, including our MicroPact and Entellitrak platform. We discussed our vision for those opportunities on our Investor Call in early June. I'm extremely pleased with the progress we've made toward these objectives in the 3 months that NIC has been a part of Tyler. Our teams have prioritized our opportunities and are very engaged, working well together in a regular cadence. Our pre-acquisition impressions regarding the high degree of compatibility between the cultures of the 2 organizations have thus far proven to be accurate and leaders in both organizations have commented on how natural the combination feels. Our payments teams are working together and have been very encouraged as we learn more about each company's strengths and how complementary they are. As we noted on our June call, the state of Florida is a great example of the kind of opportunities we're pursuing. NIC is in the process of implementing a statewide payment processing solution for the state government in Florida. And the contract allows for local governments in the state, more than 400 of which are Tyler clients, to piggyback on that contract and we are actively pursuing those opportunities. For the last 2 months, we've also been conducting weekly showcases to familiarize NIC state enterprise managers with Tyler's broad portfolio of solutions and to surface opportunities in their states. We have already developed a growing joint pipeline that is generating active engagements with prospects in NIC states. And finally, our teams are actively working together to jointly establish the data and analytics platform for Connected Communities, leveraging our respective strengths, including our Socrata Data & Insights platform and NIC's Gov2Go Citizen portal. Together, NIC and Tyler can now provide the most expansive set of capabilities for citizens to interact with government at all levels. Turning to the quarter. NIC, like Tyler, had a very strong second quarter as they continue to benefit from the recovery from the pandemic with a growing demand for citizens and businesses to interact digitally with government. NIC also recorded higher than expected revenues from its tour health and pandemic unemployment initiatives, although those lower-margin revenues are currently expected to taper off in the second half of the year. Although NIC's results are only included in Tyler's consolidated financials from the date of the acquisition on April 21, for the full quarter, NIC's core revenues, excluding revenues from Tour Health and Pandemic Unemployment Initiatives, grew 23.5%. We're also very pleased to report that in late June, NIC was selected as 1 of 2 vendors to provide the Internal Revenue Service with a digital payment processing solution, which will allow individual and business taxpayers to securely pay their federal taxes. The contract has an initial 6-month term with 4 1-year renewal options and revenue under the contract is expected to begin in January of 2022. The actual revenue will be driven by the number of taxpayers who choose to pay online and who choose to use the NIC platform, and we expect to aggressively market our solution. We currently estimate annual gross revenue under the contract to be between $40 million and $60 million with annual net revenue of $5 million to $7 million after interchange and merchant fees. This contract significantly expands NIC's payment processing at the federal level and underscores the strength of NIC's platform and leadership in public sector payments. Moving on to our consolidated results. Our second quarter was very strong, reflecting the inclusion of the results of NIC from April 21 with both core Tyler and NIC operations exceeding expectations. Total revenues grew 49.1% driven by the inclusion of NIC, as well as the acceleration of Tyler's organic growth to 12.4%. Recurring revenues comprised 79% of our second quarter revenues and were led by 133% growth in subscription revenues with the inclusion of NIC. Excluding NIC revenues, subscription revenue growth was robust at 24%. Software licenses and services revenues also rebounded from the low point in last year's second quarter, growing 17% or 7.6%, excluding NIC. As expected, our margins were down compared to second quarter last year as some costs and lower margin revenues, like billable travel, that declined in 2020 due to COVID pandemic began to return. Margins were also impacted by the inclusion of NIC and particularly by the continuation of their lower-margin COVID-related revenues. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 100 basis points to 26.5%. Bookings in the second quarter grew 50% to approximately $464 million with the inclusion of NIC. Excluding NIC, bookings rose 17.5%. Our largest deal in the quarter was a combination license and SaaS arrangement with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies valued at approximately $9.3 million for our Entellitrak regulatory, Socrata Data & Insights, and SceneDoc Mobile Field Inspection Solutions, as well as NIC's electronic payment solution. And all those solutions will be hosted in AWS. This deal is a great example of our ability to add value by offering multiple Tyler products, many of which came from recent acquisitions, into a single deal, enhancing the competitiveness of solutions like Entellitrak. We also signed a large public safety license contract with the Lake County Sheriffs office in Illinois for our CAD, RMS, Mobile, Field Reporting, Brazos e-citation, Soft Code Process Service and Socrata Data & Insight solutions valued at approximately $4.1 million. In addition, we signed 4 other license deals across multiple product suites, each with contract values greater than $1 million. SaaS contracts represented 65% of our new contract software value in the second quarter. Our largest SaaS contract was a 5-year deal with Dubuque, Iowa, for our Munis ERP and EnerGov Civic Services Solutions valued at approximately $4.6 million. We also signed SaaS contracts for our Munis ERP solution with Charles County, Maryland, valued at approximately $4 million; and DeSoto, Texas valued at approximately $3.5 million. We also signed a SaaS deal for our Tyler Supervision Solution with Riverside County, California, valued at approximately $3.3 million. This is the largest deal to date for our Supervision product, which came to Tyler through the acquisition of CaseloadPRO, a little less than 3 years ago. And in fact, the value of the single contract is greater than the total annual revenues of that business when we acquired it. In addition, we signed 9 other SaaS arrangements during the quarter, each with a total contract value of greater than $1 million. In addition to the IRS payment processing contract, during the second quarter, NIC signed extensions of its state enterprise contracts for digital government and payment processing services with the states of Oregon and Idaho. NIC also signed a 5-year SaaS agreement for its RXGov prescription drug monitoring program solution with the province of New Brunswick, Canada, marking the first international deployment for that solution. We're pleased to see the increased market activity and trends that reflect our markets are rebounding back toward pre-COVID levels. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter. Thanks, Brian. As you can see, our team of professionals, including our new team members at NIC, DataSpec and ReadySub, executed at a very high level in the second quarter, driving results that surpassed expectations. As I've said before, I'm extremely proud of how our team members have responded to the challenges in the last 1.5 years with incredible grit, grace and resilience. And we're proud that Tyler has recently been named a Best Place to Work by publications in Washington, D.C., Colorado and Mississippi, joining several other locations where Tyler has received similar awards. We've continued to invest in, and in some cases, accelerate all of our long-term strategic initiatives, in particular, our shift to a cloud-first approach with a focus on optimizing our products for the cloud and transitioning SaaS deployments from Tyler data centers to AWS. As a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. We continue to see indications that our market is returning to normal, as many delayed procurement processes are moving forward and new processes are starting. RFPs and sales activities such as demos are trending toward, and in some cases, exceeding pre-COVID levels. While not a significant factor in Q2, we expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments and $167 billion of aid schools under the American Rescue Plan Act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects and potentially provide a tailwind over the next 2 to 3 years.  With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A. Well, the -- I'd say one of the factors certainly is that we've increased the expectation around the amount of revenues, certainly both in this quarter and continuing on into the third quarter around the COVID-related services that NIC is providing. Those have gone on a little bit longer. We expect they'd wrap up really in the second quarter and those are continuing on into the second half of the year. So that's part of the factor around the second quarter outperforming on the revenue side, but not expecting to see that same bump in the second half of the year. Otherwise, we took up the guidance a bit. But typically, by the -- in the second quarter, we're not looking to raise numbers quite a bit until we have better visibility around the second half. That's expected to be growth accounting. We're the merchant of record there, and we'll be responsible for the merchant and interchange fees. So it's a higher revenue number, but lower margin. Yes. I mean if we're we're looking at -- we said sort of between $40 million and $60 million in revenues and the net revenue number kind of in the $5 million to $7 million range. I'd add, the American Rescue Plan, they've got until the end of 2024 to spend that. In fact, they just are getting the first half this year and the second half a year from now of those funds. So there's still a lot of allocations and determinations within these governments around how they're going to spend that money. So as we said in the prepared remarks, we really haven't seen much of an impact in terms of new deals and things that are of a significant size that are specifically tied to those funds. Most of the activity we're seeing today is more around the recovery of the -- or the resumption of some of those delayed processes and things that would have taken place in the last year otherwise. Are you talking specifically with the NIC integration? Yes. So the integration is going well. We talked about it on our -- I think it was our June update call. We've got a lot of excitement. We have -- our priorities, though, we really want to make sure that they -- we don't do anything to mess up the business. We make their plan, retain their staff, identify these initiatives, get the sales teams aligned and we're doing that. Obviously, Harry Herington, their founder, he decided to retire. One of the key things that we first had to do was establish new leadership. We've done that. Elizabeth Proudfit's now leading that division. She's been with NIC for over 20 years and been responsible for selling most of their major state enterprise contracts, including Florida. As I mentioned in my comments, we've hit the ground running. Our Tyler teams are showcasing products really 2 to 3 a week with all of their state GMs. Our payments teams have gotten together and working on Tyler technology integration plans, talking about how we can leverage NIC relationships. I guess I'd say all that stuff is -- it's active. It's going on. The excitement continues to be there. I'll echo my comments from back in June, balancing expectations. If you've been around a long time, these things take time. But the excitement is there. And we are seeing and identifying joint opportunities. It takes a while for those to come to fruition. But like I said, every time our teams meet, the excitement only continues to grow. Thanks, Scott. I'll start. And I'd say it's a little bit of both. Q2 last year was a slow year. And we talked about it in the last couple of earnings calls, about how the impact was really felt a little bit differently across different parts of our business. But what we're starting to see now is that the number of RFPs are up significantly from Q2 a year ago, up over 50%. Trade shows are returning. Our unsigned selections, which we don't talk about a lot. Those are up significantly. The number of new deals, as you pointed out, that we signed this quarter was, I think, up over 30% from a year ago. When you look at areas like where I talked about the last few quarters, where we saw a little bit more slowdown was more in our high-end financials, our Munis and our EnerGov solutions. We're certainly seeing the momentum growing there. I think Q4 was probably a low in those areas for RFPs and selections. And those are up significantly. And remember, those types of deals, they generally take about 3 quarters from RFP to close. So there will continue to be a lag as we're seeing these RFPs come up, but that's continuing other places like our lower-end financials, our in code. I think RFPs now are actually back to 2019 levels. So it's there. It's a combination of pent-up demand, but also just the market returning. First, I'm not sure I heard all that. The first question was about the pipeline. The pipeline is -- I think across all our major core apps, the pipeline is certainly returning. I don't know that it's -- I think there are parts of our business where it's back to full pre-COVID levels and in some cases exceeding, some places, it's approaching there. So all the signs right now out there, all the leading indicators that we talk about, demos and trade shows are coming back, RFPs being released, deals without RFPs. Those are all up significantly sequentially quarter and significant year-over-year. So that's significant. And the second question was about -- I didn't quite catch the second question. Could you just repeat the second one? It's a good question. I think it's just all part of the overall equation. I think the increase that we've seen, I talked earlier about our financial solutions, Munis and Encode. I mean our new deals there are 85%, 90% SaaS. A couple of years ago, it was more like in the 50% range. I think it's just -- I think that's just a piece of the puzzle. I don't know that there's anything specific around some of those cyber security things, but security is a big part of it. But I think it's that, coupled with COVID, coupled with just the general direction the market had been moving over the last several years. Yes, that's right, Rob. This is a Tyler contract from the get-go, and it was it really emanated from our -- the MicroPact acquisition, our Tyler Federal business. MicroPact had relationships with NIC even prior to our deal. And so it would not be unusual for them to have been in deals together. And so having them part of that is, as you say, it's a nice round out.  It also -- I think it highlights -- when we talk about a lot of these large deals, and I mentioned it in my remarks. And it really highlights the value of our acquisition strategy over the years. I mean, when you talk about -- that's a deal that -- it's our largest deal of the quarter. Well, that's our entellitrak that came from MicroPact. It includes Socrata, another recent acquisition, SceneDoc, the NIC payments. It includes our strategic alliance with AWS. It is kind of a showcase deal for the quarter. And again, I think, validates our acquisition strategy and how it plays in the market even as it may take time for us to sort of build up and get these larger contracts that really put us in a competitive position that makes it difficult for others to compete with. Yes. And Jonathan, we're also -- we're doing things to try to incentivize more remote delivery of service as well in terms of pricing and things like that. And I think we're still trying to feel it out, as Brian said. The expectation is we will not go back to pre-COVID levels. There are parts of our business that really sort of still demand on site, as Brian mentioned, public safety. But on the others, we're going to work with our clients and working in different ways to try to bring that down. So you're talking about the NIC state contracts? Yes. So it's a couple of things. I mean those contracts that -- NIC has done an amazing job over the years. It takes them a little bit longer, but really of establishing contracts that are extremely open-ended and as we like to use the term hunting licenses. And so it allows those -- under those contracts to pursue a lot of different opportunities with a lot of different agencies and in some cases, even local jurisdictions. It allows them to push products. But more importantly, too, it also -- what they also bring is, as I just mentioned, is their deep relationships with different agencies and different higher execs at the state level, areas that where Tyler just didn't have any exposure. And so it's leveraging those relationships, leveraging Tyler's products, leveraging those open-ended contracts, really creates a whole new opportunity for Tyler that we've never seen before. An example would be we're having discussions with a particular state with some court solutions. And we're actually able to have conversations at an extremely high level at a place where Tyler traditionally just had not been able to do it. And those relationships are coming from those state contracts.  And I mentioned the state of Oregon and the State of Idaho as renewals for NIC. And what's important there is the Oregon contract, that's an extension, but that's an extension of a 10-year relationship. The Idaho contract is a 2-year extension on a 22-year relationship. So these are very deep relationships that NIC has done. Getting these renewals is something you don't take for granted, and you've got to continue to deliver value. And I think the flip side of that is what Tyler can bring is, as we continue to leverage those relationships and put more products, it will actually bring that more value to those contracts and further deepen those relationships so that those will continue to sustain and survive well into the future. Yes. So you're right. So they went with 2 providers. No, it's not a partnership. What will be chosen is by the actual citizen or business who chooses to pay. It's not unlike there are certain areas with our e-filing where there we may be the -- there may be multiple people who are providing that service even though the back end is through Tyler. We'll be marketing and doing what we can, we'll be trying to provide the best service. What's interesting, though, is that prior to this contract, they had actually -- I think they had 4 vendors, none of which were selected here. There are 3 vendors. And both of us and the other vendor were new selections by the IRS. Yes. So I think they had -- as you mentioned, a really great quarter. I think the revenue was up around 19%. And really, they really outperformed in a couple of areas. Their state enterprise transaction revenue, which includes payments and also their outdoor licensing, their recreation.gov as more and more people are getting outdoors, it's just -- it's up significantly over a year ago. Obviously, we also mentioned the COVID-related services continue to outperform even as we expect those to taper off. But yes, it's that state enterprise transaction revenue related payments, outdoor licensing and COVID. I'd say we're still in the early innings there. The expectation for me is, across our business lines, as we get into the second half of the year, we're going to start putting new clients there. We've still been over the last year, still been validating really sort of some of the costs. It's a project we call Lighthouse where we've got -- we're taking existing clients across all of our core apps and we're putting them in AWS, running them and verifying the costs and seeing -- obviously, we're doing things already to make changes to our products to make them run more efficient in AWS, but this also helps provide a road map. And I think as you see going into next year, you're going to continue to see movement of new business into AWS because the goal is to eventually move out of 2 Tyler data centers to 1. So we're going to need to start bringing that down. We'll start with new business and then we will probably start accelerating our -- we've already been accelerating our flips, but at some point, put together a more robust migration for existing. But I'd say, overall, we're still in the early innings. And I think we'd probably be in a more better position to report on that kind of progress really starting next year. And to be honest, Kirk, that's my hope because that means that COVID is going away. Yes, the gross versus net payments primarily, which also impacts margins. I don't think there's a fundamental change in that process. And like I said, what I believe will happen over time is NIC, as I said, they've done a great job of building these relationships. These are all very long-term relationships. They got to continue to deliver value. And what I think will happen over time is that as Tyler is able to enhance that value, it will only -- I think it will only help to facilitate those renewals in the future. Great. Thanks, Andrew, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We certainly hope you stay safe and healthy, and if you have any further questions or follow-up, please feel free to reach out to Brian Miller or myself. Thanks, everybody."

Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, providing an exceptional start to 2021. Recurring revenues, which comprised 75% of our first quarter revenues, were strong, led by a 25% growth in subscription revenues. However, software licenses and services revenues continue to be pressured by longer sales cycles and delays in projects as clients deal with the ongoing effects of the pandemic. A favorable revenue mix with strong subscription growth, coupled with cost efficiencies, drove a 270 basis point expansion of our non-GAAP operating margin to 26.8%. Cash flow continued to be very robust as cash from operations grew 26% and free cash flow grew almost 34%. We're pleased to see signs of growing activity in our public sector markets and expect that federal stimulus under the American Rescue Plan Act will have a positive impact on government technology spending going forward. Bookings in the first quarter were solid at approximately $247 million, but were down 22.8% against a very challenging comparison with the first quarter of 2020. Our largest deal in the quarter was a SaaS arrangement for our Munis ERP solution with the City of Fresno, California valued at approximately $10 million. Other significant SaaS contracts included ERP deals with Hall County, Georgia, and Fort Smith, Arkansas. And an Odyssey Courts deal with Val Verde County, Texas. Our largest on-premises contracts include an ExecuTime time contract with the U.S. Virgin Islands, Public Safety and Brazos citations contracts with Montgomery County, New York, and Cicero, Illinois, and an EnerGov contract with the Commonwealth of The Bahamas. So far this year, we've been busy on the M&A front. On March 31, we completed 2 tuck-in acquisitions, DataSpec and ReadySub, for a total purchase price of $12 million in cash. DataSpec is a market-leading provider of software for the electronic management of veterans' claims. DataSpec's web-based Software-as-a-Service system called VetraSpec allows for secure electronic claims submission to the Federal Department of Veterans Affairs and reporting capabilities, in addition to scheduling, calendaring and payments. DataSpec offers county, state and national versions of VetraSpec, with state solutions making up majority of its implementations. The solution allows state departments to execute and analyze reports on the entire state, individual offices, regions and districts, and individual users. ReadySub is a cloud-based platform that delivers comprehensive absence and substitute teacher management solutions, serving approximately 1,000 school districts across the United States, with only approximately 20 of which overlapping with Tyler's 2,000 school district clients. The solution helps districts with the labor-intensive and demanding task of filling both planned and unplanned staff absences with the most highly qualified substitute resources. With continuous pressure due to substitute teacher shortages, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, districts can more easily retain a pool of qualified substitutes and automate the searching and filing of needed substitute spots. Additionally, ReadySub can integrate districts' payroll processes, eliminating duplicate work and streamlining related payroll tasks. Most importantly, last week, we completed the $2.3 billion cash acquisition of NIC, a leading digital government solutions and payments company that serves more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. NIC delivers user-friendly digital services that make it easier and more efficient for citizens and businesses to interact with government, providing valuable conveniences like applying for unemployment insurance, submitting business filings, renewing licenses, accessing information and making secure payments without visiting a government office. In addition, NIC has extensive experience and expertise and scale in the government payments area, processing more than $24 billion in payments on behalf of citizens and governments last year, which will accelerate Tyler's strategic payments initiative. With the addition of NIC's highly complementary industry-leading digital government solutions and payment services to Tyler's broad client base and multiple sales channels, the combined company will be well equipped to address the tremendous demand at the federal, state and local levels for innovative platform services. Together, Tyler and NIC will connect data and processes across disparate systems and deliver essential products and services to all public sector stakeholders. NIC had revenues of $460.5 million and net income of $68.6 million in 2020. While NIC will cease to be an SEC reporting company, and therefore, will not issue a first quarter earnings release, they also had a very strong first quarter results that exceeded their plan. NIC's core first quarter revenues, excluding the TourHealth and COVID initiatives that are expected to wind down after the second quarter, grew more than 10% over last year. In addition, NIC's operating income, again excluding the TourHealth and COVID initiatives as well as acquisition costs, rose more than 20%. We are thrilled to welcome the more than 1,000 talented employees of NIC, DataSpec and ReadySub to the Tyler family, and look forward to realizing the tremendous benefits these transactions can bring to our collective team members and clients and to Tyler shareholders. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter.\nBrian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results in comparison with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the investor relations section of our website under the financial reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $294.8 million, up 6.6% on a GAAP basis and 6.5% on a non-GAAP basis. As you may recall, we were off to a very strong start in the first 2 months of 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic began to significantly affect our business in March. So we're generally pleased with our growth this quarter against that comparison. Software license revenues declined 20.3%, reflecting both extended sales cycles and a high mix of subscription deals at 66% of new software contract value. Software services revenue declined 8.6% as a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our shift to remote delivery of most services resulted in a decline in billable travel revenue. On the positive side, subscription revenues rose 25.4%. We added 84 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 39 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $52 million in total contract value. In Q1 of last year, we added 131 new subscription-based arrangements and had 19 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $98 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 66% of total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 73% in Q1 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 4.0 years compared to 5.9 years last year. Revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, were $26.9 million, up 22.4%. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $15.6 million, up 4.8%, and e-payments revenue of $11.3 million, up 59.3%. For the first quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $886 million, up 12.9%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q1 was approximately $302 million, up 26.3%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $108 million, up 22.4%, and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $476 million, up 4.1%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.55 billion, up 3%. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were solid at $247 million. However, this was down 22.8% compared to a difficult comparison to Q1 of last year. Last year's first quarter bookings included several large contracts, including 2 significant follow-on SaaS deals with the North Carolina courts, with a combined contract value of approximately $38 million. For the trailing 12-month bookings were approximately $1.2 billion, down 13.3%, although they do not include the majority of the $98 million extension of our Texas e-filing contract signed in Q4 of 2020, because of certain termination provisions in that contract. If the Texas e-filing renewal was fully included, trailing 12-month bookings would have been down only 6.4%. The prior trailing 12-month bookings also included 4 significant SaaS deals with the North Carolina courts, with a combined contract value of approximately $123 million. The bookings growth rate in Q1 was also affected by a shorter average term for new subscription contracts. Our software subscription bookings in the first quarter added $10.2 million in new annual recurring revenue. Cash flow was once again very strong in the first quarter as cash from operations increased 26.4% to $71.7 million and free cash flow grew 33.9% to $61.7 million, representing an all-time high for first quarter free cash flow. We financed the NIC acquisition with a mixture of debt at very attractive rates that gives us a flexible capital structure. In March, we completed a $600 million offering of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2026. The notes are convertible into Tyler common stock at a conversion price of $493.44, which represents a 30% premium over our closing price on March 4. On April 21, concurrent with the closing of the NIC acquisition, we entered into a new $1.4 billion senior unsecured credit facility with a group of 8 banks. The facility includes a $300 million term note due in 2024 and a $600 million term note due in 2026, both of which can be prepaid without penalty. The facility also includes a new 5-year $500 million revolving credit agreement that replaces our prior $400 million revolver. The combination of the convertible debt, term notes and revolver provide us with a great deal of flexibility. Our balance sheet remains very strong and its pro forma net leverage at the NIC closing was approximately 3.2 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. And we expect to end the year with net leverage under 2.5 times. The current blended interest rate on the $1.75 billion of debt we have outstanding today is 1.1%. We remain on track to achieve or exceed the annual revenue and EPS guidance that we communicated in February for Tyler, excluding the impact of the NIC acquisition. As Lynn mentioned, NIC also had a very strong first quarter results that exceeded their plans. We expect the NIC acquisition will be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings and EBITDA as well as to our recurring revenue mix and free cash flow per share in 2021. Because of antitrust restrictions, we took a conservative approach to our integration and strategic planning for NIC prior to closing the transaction last week. We are currently working closely with NIC's leadership to evaluate strategic growth opportunities that take advantage of the combined strengths of the 2 businesses and determine the impact on our 2021 plan. We expect to complete the fine-tuning of our joint operating and financial plans for the remainder of the year and issue 2021 guidance for the combined company during the second quarter. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Lynn.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. Our team of professionals, including our new NIC team members, executed at a high level in the first quarter, driving results that surpassed expectations for both Tyler and NIC, and provided a great start to 2021. Exiting 2020, our financial position was stronger than ever, allowing us to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, including NIC, the largest acquisition in our history with a purchase price of $2.3 billion in cash. We've also been able to continue to invest in and, in some cases, accelerate all of our long-term strategic initiatives, in particular, our shift to a cloud-first approach. As a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. We believe we will continue to see an acceleration of the public sector's move to the cloud, and we are in a great position to support that move. I'm happy to say that we are on track with the strategic investments in optimizing our products for the cloud that we discussed on our fourth quarter call. This quarter, we saw early indicators that our market is beginning to recover as some delayed procurement processes are moving forward and RFP activity is growing from the levels of the second half of 2020. We also expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments under the American Rescue Plan Act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects, and have a positive impact on recovery of our markets. One topic I've not discussed on these calls before pertains to our efforts regarding environmental and social initiatives. Tyler's culture guides our commitment to being a responsible partner in the communities where we live, work and serve our clients. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Tyler Foundation, which since its creation has provided millions of dollars to charities and causes that positively impact our communities. Our culture is also the foundation for our belief in the importance of providing an inclusive and diverse workplace. We are proud to have been included in the Forbes America's Best Employers for Diversity list for the past 2 consecutive years. The pause in normal office occupancy and business travel due to the pandemic provided an opportunity for us to evaluate our environmental impact across our major office locations and identify opportunities to make our practices more consistent and effective. Last year, we formed an environmental task force to strengthen our sustainability efforts across our office locations and the communities we impact. We achieved a significant milestone last year by responding to Tyler's first invitation to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index survey. More than 3,500 of the world's largest publicly-listed companies provide detailed data and background to this global survey for evaluation by its independent sustainability ranking body. Completing the survey was an important opportunity for Tyler to uncover opportunities to strengthen our core responsibility strategy. We recently published our second annual corporate responsibility report, which is available on our website. This report represents a significant expansion of our reporting on our ESG efforts. And we look forward to continuing our journey and sharing our progress in this area. Finally, this week, we are virtually hosting more than 5,000 clients at Connect 2021, our annual user conference with a theme called Virtually Possible. Team members from across Tyler are providing nearly 700 hours of valuable content for our clients using our advanced virtual event platform. We are excited to be able to connect with so many clients at our virtual event, and we look forward to connecting with them in person at Connect 2022. With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Yes, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Matt VanVliet from BTIG.\nMatt VanVliet: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Really appreciate it. I guess as you look at some of the commentary you talked about, about slower sales cycles, but really starting to pick up maybe at the end of the quarter, curious what the federal aid bill kind of points to. Are there any specific areas in your business that you think will have particular earmarks of spending? Are there any limitations that you've seen in the bill so far? Just kind of help us out with where you think the biggest upside will be across the portfolio.\nLynn Moore: Yeah. Thanks, Matt. That's a good question. I think right now there's still - our clients generally know the money is there. There is still a little bit of uncertainty about how to access it. There is certainly money that's been earmarked for IT modernization efforts. And so, I think what it's done is it's given our clients a little bit more confidence. I don't know that, I would say it necessarily benefits one more than the other. Although one thing that we were noticing last year was in our state business and that - our state business was off quite a bit last year, and there was a little bit of uncertainty around there. As it turns out, a lot of the state budgets were not as impacted as they first thought a year ago. And so, I think the combination of that along with this American Rescue Plan funding is providing a boost in that state area. We're starting to see that with some of the RFPs and things that we knew that were intended to come out that got delayed and we're starting to see some of that. But I'd say, across our entire product lines, I think there is reason for I'd call cautious optimism in what's going on in the markets, and a big part of that is the American Rescue Plan.\nBrian Miller: And I would just add to that on the Rescue Plan that, the CARES Act, the first stimulus, couldn't be used by governments to replace lost revenue. And it was roughly $150 billion for states and just $150 billion for the largest cities and counties. This $350 billion goes much deeper across states and local governments. And there are very few restrictions on what it can be used for. The funding is just now becoming available to governments. Half of it available roughly now within 60 days of when it was passed. And then the other half is available 12 months from now. So we wouldn't have expected to see much impact on customers' purchasing activities and buying decisions yet. But it certainly points to an opportunity as we move through the year to provide significant relief.\nMatt VanVliet: It's very helpful. And then, I guess just following up on sort of the stages of integration for NIC, from a product standpoint and the ability to sort of up-sell, cross-sell both across your customer base and then into theirs, what should we expect in terms of timing? Is there any real heavy lifting to get the products to be fully integrated? Is there anything that needs to be done from a technical standpoint to push their payments platform into your local governments, maybe just how you're thinking about kind of that process from a more technical and sort of product standpoint?\nLynn Moore: Yeah, sure, Matt. I'd say a couple of things. As we mentioned in our comments, we're really just now beginning to sort of dig deep into our integration efforts and our strategic initiatives. And in fact, this week, we had the senior executives of both companies meeting face-to-face for the first time, which was exciting, and really start brainstorming. And at a high level, we already know sort of some of the major initiatives that we want to take on. And the good news is there are a lot of initiatives. And one thing that we need to do and be careful about is make sure that we prioritize them, look at some of the low-hanging fruit and look at some of the things that will have the most impact. You mentioned payments. That certainly is one of our largest initiatives. From a technical standpoint, there is still a little bit of work to do there. But NIC is the unquestioned leader in payments in the public sector at the state level, and it's a growing thing for us. What we see there is the ability to leverage our client base and get payments more at the local level and leverage their technical experience to help boost our payments. We talked about other sort of integrations and things. We talked before about their state enterprise contracts, which provide sort of hunting licenses. And in fact, it's those state contracts, which they classify as state enterprise revenues, where they go in and then they sort of - they plant a seed and then they're able to go build additional revenues from there. On their own, this first quarter, those revenues were up 20%, which is pretty exciting. And then, what we start talking about is what kind of products do we have at Tyler that we can really just go in and push there. And I don't think there's a lot of technical integration there that's going to need to be done. But that's another one of our major initiatives that we're looking at right now.\nMatt VanVliet: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Scott Berg with Needham & Company.\nScott Berg: Hey, Lynn and Brian, thanks for taking my questions, I guess, I got 2 here. First of all, Lynn, obviously, COVID is still impacting your businesses, as it is several in my coverage universe. But as I look at deal flow in the quarter, it looks like your new subscription contracts were - at 84 was substantially weaker than what we've seen at least over the last 2 or 3 quarters. I guess, as you look at that business, any product area, in particular, kind of driving maybe some of the softness in the quarter versus license sales, which was pretty much in line with last couple of quarters?\nLynn Moore: Yeah, Scott. We talked about it last year. The expectation really was that, I guess I'd sort of call it the COVID hangover, would bleed into this year, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that our clients' budget cycles are July 1, June 30. And it's a good question. But at the same time, these are the deals that we've signed. And what we're starting to see is, in Q1, for example, we're starting to see more RFPs, we're starting to see more demos, and we're actually - some of the awards that we've gotten in Q1 that are not signed are actually starting to skew even more heavily toward SaaS. We don't normally talk about unsigned awards. We talked last year about how COVID was impacting different parts of our business differently. And we saw a little bit greater impact, say, more on the high-end financials, where Munis is, where a lot of our license sales are. And what we've seen so far in Q1 actually is that the awards that we're getting and the deals that are coming in are skewing at 80-plus percent to SaaS right now. So I think that overall trend that we've talked about is still going on. There's just a little bit of lumpiness and a little bit of hangover still from COVID.\nScott Berg: Got it. You actually targeted a little bit. My second question was on those unsigned awards. Brian, we talked about that obviously over the last 6 or 7 years. There is certainly some variance from quarter-to-quarter. As you look at those unsigned awards, was that number, I guess, coming out of Q1, materially higher than what you've seen in the last couple of quarters? Or was it kind of in line with that similar amount?\nBrian Miller: I'd say it's a little bit higher. As Lynn said, we saw these pauses in procurement processes in second quarter of last year, third quarter of last year, even to the fourth quarter of last year, where RFP volumes were down. Our clients were adapting to remote work. We weren't able to do in-person demos and some clients wanted to - it took a little while longer to adapt to doing a lot of those things remotely. So there were these pauses and delays in sales processes, particularly early-stage sales processes last year. And given our normal sales cycles that are 9 months to a year in typical deals, we expect that would show up in bookings now as we move into the fourth quarter, the first quarter of this year, those delays. And so, really our pipeline is still very robust. The RFP activity is picking up. So as we've said all along, it's really a matter of timing. We haven't seen deals go away. We've just seen the timing pushed out, and it's not surprising that it's showing up. And given that more of the deals are skewing toward subscription, it's more evident in the lower subscription bookings than in the license deals.\nScott Berg: Got it. That's all I have. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird.\nRobert Oliver: Great. Thank you, guys, for taking my question. Lynn, one for you. I just want to go back to the, I think, Matt's initial question on the American Rescue Plan. Obviously, sizable amounts of money flowing into local municipal, I think, Brian, you had mentioned that there weren't as many restrictions on the money. Some of our conversations are still, I guess, there are still some uncertainty about how exactly this is going to be spent. One area, in particular, where we're hearing it's green-lighted in schools, and that's I think a noisier market than it's been in the past. But I know you mentioned you guys have 2,000 customers there, ReadySub tuck-ins, seems like it's really perfectly timed just as that was a nightmare to manage moving through COVID. But just curious, if you guys can just kind of frame the schools' opportunity or maybe any other early indications of that \"growing activity\u201d you're seeing, as those ARP funds are hitting and people are starting to do projects.\nLynn Moore: Yeah, Rob, that's a good point you make and you're right. We talked about it last year, how, again, the impact of COVID did impact different parts of our business differently. While we had certain areas of our business, I just mentioned the higher-end ERP, schools was an area that was definitely impacted a lot. And our business in schools was off last year. At the same time, I also mentioned last quarter that last year was a record sales year in our courts business. So it's a little bit of a - it's just different across our business. You're right, the American Rescue Plan, I do expect - there are some money that's specifically targeted for K through 12 and higher education. I think there is about $160 million, $170 million targeted for that. And I think what we're starting to see, generally, is just the more receptiveness from our clients in the schools area in terms of getting RFPs out, in terms of talking about deals. There was a - I'd say there was an area last year where it was, I wouldn't say silenced, but it was certainly muted a little bit, and that's certainly coming back.\nRobert Oliver: Great. Yeah, sorry - go ahead.\nLynn Moore: And to your point about ReadySub, you're right. That's a really exciting opportunity for us. It's kind of a small deal. And it's a deal that's not just you want substitute teacher application that can go in. It's also becoming more - that type of application is becoming more and more of a requirement in our ERP space for schools. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have over 2,000 school clients. And right now, that application is only in about 20 of them. And it's sort of the same playbook we had several years ago, we did the ExecuTime acquisition. We expect that we're going to be able to grow that product pretty well and it will be great for our inside sales channels as well as new business.\nRobert Oliver: That's helpful. Thanks, Lynn. I appreciate it. And then, Brian, just a quick follow-up for you. Conversions were up really nicely year-over-year. Is that a function of things having frozen maybe in March and comp being easier or customers more willing to convert to subscription or kind of a mixture of the both? I know you guys are obviously leaning in more on subscription and subscription first, but just wanted to get a better handle on the dynamic there. Thank you.\nBrian Miller: Yes, it's really more the latter. The last 2 quarters have been really strong in terms of conversions picking back up again. And I think that's consistent with what we see in the new business market with more and more customers wanting to move to the subscription of the SaaS model. And as we've said, the complications of trying to remotely access some of these systems has certainly risen to the forefront during COVID and increased customers' desires to move on-premises systems into the cloud. And our relationship with AWS, our capacity that we have available through AWS and - is giving us additional ability to push conversions more aggressively into our customer base.\nRobert Oliver: Great. Thanks again, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.\nKeith Housum: Good morning, guys. If I could unpack the backlog number just a little bit more. It looks like the - or I'm sorry, the bookings number, it looks like for services actually, the services bookings actually went down by about $25 million in the quarter. Was there a cancellation in the quarter?\nBrian Miller: No cancellations, but you're talking about compared to last year?\nKeith Housum: Yeah, I think the $247 million you have in new bookings for the quarter, it looks like software and service bookings were actually down by $25 million.\nBrian Miller: Yeah, I think part of that is billable travel that runs through revenue and therefore through bookings. Last year, we were still traveling through most of the quarter, so you're going to see part of that. That's probably about $5 million of it. I'd say that, in general, the - as we move more to a cloud business, you typically see a little bit lower level of services with new cloud contracts. But I'd say most of that just goes along with the delays in some of the bookings. So along with - both on the license and subscription side, but no, we have not seen any cancellations. There have been - that's really held true throughout the whole last year. We've not seen any meaningful cancellations, either of contracts that are in progress or of projects in the pipeline, really just delays.\nKeith Housum: Okay, got you. And if I could unpack the NIC numbers just a little bit more, it sounds like it was better than expected. If I heard what you say right revenue was up, excluding the one-offs of TourHealth and the Virginia pandemic assistance program more than 10%. But yet, I think you said the enterprise revenue was up 20%. How was the transaction revenue for NIC last year - last quarter?\nLynn Moore: Yeah, Keith, they're interactive governance services, which is, as you know, is transaction-based, that was up 16% year-over-year. So in the areas where they're really strategic and growing, they really had a really good solid first quarter.\nKeith Housum: Great. Glad to see that. Hey, Lynn, you don't happen to have the DHR numbers as well, do you?\nLynn Moore: DHR was actually...\nKeith Housum: Driver history records?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. No, I know DHR, I'm going off memory here. I believe DHR was up about 4% in the quarter, give or take, which was nice to see, given that I think it was the first time they've actually increased in the quarter and maybe 4 quarters. But, as you know, that revenue is probably more stable. And again, when you look at interactive government services, they're [same store] [ph] enterprise revenues, that's really their growth drivers. And those were up nicely in Q1.\nKeith Housum: Yeah, absolutely great. I appreciate it. Thanks for the color, guys. Good luck.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Peter Levine with Evercore.\nPeter Levine: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. So with the move towards cloud, we've seen obviously in the corporate side acceleration of cloud based on the idea that some employees will be given the flexibility of work-from-home, hybrid. Obviously, cloud helps to enable that. Curious, if you're seeing or hearing similar trends on the public sector side, I'm sure there's a certain segment of public employees that could permanently be remote. But just curious now, could this be a catalyst to accelerate cloud adoption?\nBrian Miller: Sorry. You weren't coming through very clearly. Could you repeat the last part of the question?\nPeter Levine: Yeah. Sorry about that. Yeah, just curious to know, does - public employees, right? We've seen the trends on the corporate side where cloud acceleration with the idea that some employees will be given the flexibility, right? So obviously, cloud helps that. But curious to know, based on your conversations, are you hearing or seeing similar trends on the public sector side? What the idea is that could this potentially be a catalyst to accelerate cloud?\nBrian Miller: Yeah, I think, that's definitely true. Typically, you will see the public sector change and evolve more slowly than the private sector. So often those things that - those trends that start in the private sector take a little bit longer to take hold in the public sector. But just like the private sector, our clients have had to move to doing things remotely, and that is, I think, a significant factor in their ongoing preference in new systems for the cloud and in the conversions from on-premise customers accelerating. Courts is a great example where courthouses were physically closed and many of them still remain closed, but courts are an essential function. And so many courts that didn't have the ability to operate their systems remote were just shut down. And we have products, for example, our virtual courts product that we accelerated bringing to market early last year that enabled courts to continue to operate remotely, licensing and permitting functions where clients have old legacy - not our clients, but public sector agencies have old legacy systems that don't allow for remote access. So you don't have people in the office processing building permits and those sorts of things that are slowing down activity. Our systems provide for that remote access, and there's certainly an accelerated interest in those. So I think, yeah, governments will, like the private sector over time look to work more remotely, and also that's a factor with NIC, the ability to interact with government and make payments remotely or online rather than coming to a government office. And as we've talked about their first quarter results, we're certainly seeing that increase in volumes as a result of that trend.\nPeter Levine: Yeah, great color. And then Lynn, to piggyback off your prior comments on government budgets and the spending bill, any more detailed commentary you can share on whether state and local government budgets are opening up, I would say, more uniformly? Or is it more of a state-by-state situation?\nLynn Moore: I don't know that I could attribute necessarily anything geographic. I would just say, generally, as a whole, we're seeing a lot of positive signs. We talked about on-site awards. We talked about RFPs, particularly in certain areas of our business. Take, for example, in the higher-end financials, our fees are up significantly over Q3 and Q4, even while they're still down from where they would have been pre-pandemic, and so that's an encouraging sign. There were a lot of big deals that we saw maybe in our appraisal space maybe in our state space that we knew these deals, we plan on these deals coming out in 2020. And those got shut down, and we're actually starting to see those getting released. So just generally speaking, it's - there's a lot of encouragement. Again, I wouldn't say we're quite over the hump yet, but let's get another quarter of seeing this activity, but I think there's general optimism. And I think it mirrors what's going on in the country. There should be a reason for optimism as people continue to get vaccinated, as businesses continue to open up, as money continues to start flowing, people start interacting. You're going to see that flow through our business as well.\nPeter Levine: Great. And if I could squeeze 1 more in. Sorry, Brian, if I missed it, I hopped on late. But how are you thinking about the combined financials? And what impact, I guess, if any - I guess, specifically the write-down of NIC's deferred revenue could have here in 2021?\nBrian Miller: We're still working through all that process. That's 1 of the reasons we aren't providing the combined guidance at this time. I would say, in general, NIC doesn't have a large deferred revenue balance on their balance sheet. Their business is more transaction-based rather than software-based. But that's certainly 1 of the factors that we're looking at closely as we develop the combined guidance. But they do tend to have less deferred revenue than, say, a pure software company.\nPeter Levine: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to - I guess, I'll make sure I fully understand this. So would you expect this quarter to potentially be the low watermark in terms of maybe year-over-year bookings growth? And do you potentially anticipate that there'll be a catch-up period once the pipeline starts to normalize even more so than it is today.\nBrian Miller: Well, it's hard to tell exactly if it's a low watermark, but we did start to see declining bookings last year in Q2. So I think our comparisons will now be against a - start to compare against pandemic-affected quarters. So really, right now, we're comparing against what was not only the last sort of pre-pandemic or pre-affected quarter, unaffected quarter, but also what was just a very strong quarter with some large deals in it. We do think there would be a catch-up. It's not likely to be sort of a dramatic 1 quarter kind of a catch-up, but the combination of, 1, the fact that these are essential systems and that the pipeline - they remain in the pipeline, the timing has just been pushed out. So, again, we're starting to see that increase in activity, those RFPs starting to pick-up again and some of those deals moving forward. So we do believe there's a catch-up. It is just a matter of timing. As we've said before, we also believe that further down the road, that the - there will be some procurements that will be accelerated that might have been - clients might have thought they had years left in existing legacy systems and the need for remote access, security concerns around some of those legacy systems will be factors that will cause them to rethink that and accelerate the replacement of those systems. They'll still need to go through buying processes. They'll still need to budget those, but we do believe that there'll be a longer-term acceleration, but that the sort of pent-up demand in the current pipeline that there will be an acceleration as that works its way out. And that would be consistent with what we saw in, for example, in the recession a decade ago.\nLynn Moore: Jonathan, I'd just add there, too, that - I like to look at the trends and look at the markets. And again, there's reason to believe the market is starting to come back. We talked about the Great Recession, but also what's our competitiveness disposition like in that market. And even while in the last 6, 9 months that the markets have been off a little bit, our actual win rates have actually been climbing. And so our competitive position continues to grow. And as we look at bookings, we've talked about this a lot over the years, we have a pretty steady stream, but it's always - there can always be some large skews in various quarters, because we do have parts of our business that get some really large deals. Last year, we were a little concerned about Q2 of last year, because Q2 of 2019, we had, I think, 1 of our largest deals in Tyler's history. And so that's kind of what we're competing against. And those large lumpy - those large deals will always sort of throw off a little bookings number. But when I look back at sort of the underlying thing, what's the market doing, what's our competitive position, what's our win rates, that's all trending in the direction that we'd like to see.\nJonathan Ho: That's helpful. Just 1 question on DataSpec and ReadySub. How do you think about cross-selling those products and leveraging them across your existing clients? And maybe how big of an opportunity could these acquisitions be? Thank you.\nLynn Moore: Yeah. So I'd say, they're a little bit different, the 2 acquisitions. They're both fairly small. ReadySub like I mentioned earlier, that's probably more like the playbook out of ExecuTime. And that's a - this is cloud-native platform. It's built in AWS. It's actually the founders of former AWS engineers. There's a clear need in that space. This is something that, to your point, we can go out and we can leverage and sell across our base pretty well. I don't know that I've got some good sort of markets for that, but it's an opportunity. And again, it's not just the opportunity of rolling out through our inside sales, but it will also help our competitiveness on new deals in the schools market as it's becoming more and more of a requirement. DataSpec, I would classify it as a little bit more of a consolidation play. They were probably the leader in the veterans' benefits application space. They had 32 state customers. That gives us a lot of credibility so that we can go out as we will eventually probably migrate those customers over to our entellitrak platform, and that just makes us the leader in that space and gives us more credibility as we look to expand in the federal markets as well as the state markets.\nJonathan Ho: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Charlie Strauzer with CJS Securities.\nCharles Strauzer: Hi, good morning. Just a quick question for you. I know you're still working through guidance on NIC, but hoping to get a little bit more color there, and also maybe timing as to when you think this quarter, you should be releasing the updated guidance at all. Thanks.\nBrian Miller: Well, we've said we'd expect to release it during the quarter. I would expect that to be roughly the end of May, beginning of June. So sometime in the next month or so, we would expect to be in a position to do that. NIC, again, we're working through not only understanding what their current plans are for the year, but really how the integration with Tyler, the ability to start to address some of our strategic initiatives and cross-selling opportunities, and what we think the timing and size of those is and how much of that will go into this year. But they're off to a strong start. As we said, overall, 10% - a little above 10% growth in their core revenues, they actually on the COVID-related revenues, significantly exceeded their plan on those, but we do expect those to wind down and not really be much of a factor after the second quarter. So their growth rate is a bit ahead of ours. And we talked about some of the strengths in their business from taking advantage of the increased desire of individuals and businesses to interact with governments digitally rather than in-person. So generally, they have a positive outlook on the year. And within the next few weeks, we expect to have that combined guidance out and be able to talk more about the plans for working together through this year.\nLynn Moore: Yeah, Charlie, if I could just add there, too, I think - yeah, I mean, this is obviously - it's a top priority, right? I mean, it's our largest acquisition of all time. And we talked a little bit about before, and I think Brian mentioned in his remarks, we were in this period from signing and close this regulatory approval period. And you can take all sorts of approaches there, and we tended to take a more conservative approach. And, I'd love to be able to share those numbers with you today. But it was because of that conservative approach, we're just not quite there yet. And the way I view it is we - Tyler very well. You follow us a long time. We're always interested in the long-term. And the thought of even potentially jeopardizing or delaying that deal by getting a few weeks head start on some of the stuff, it just didn't seem worth it. But it is a top priority. I think we'll get those numbers out, as Brian said, in about a month. But we know that it's going to be accretive to earnings. We know it's going to accretive to EBITDA and all the things we mentioned before and the excitements there. And I appreciate if there's even a little bit of frustration, and part of it's just the timing around that we just closed in our earnings releases now. If we closed a month before earnings release, we've probably been ready to do this.\nCharles Strauzer: Totally understand. Thank you for that.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Peter Heckmann with D. A. Davidson.\nPeter Heckmann: Hey, good morning. I understand, I would be looking forward to the combined guidance here in a few weeks, so I'll hold my questions on that until then. But just curious on the balance sheet, I mean, Tyler generates really strong cash flow. But would you expect to direct virtually all of free cash flow to debt reduction until you get to some threshold limit or - and refrain from the buyback in the interim?\nLynn Moore: I don't think there's necessarily a predisposition towards that. I think we're always opportunistic. And I think, at this point in time, acquisitions, we've done 3. Acquisitions will probably need to be a little more compelling. I'm not suggesting that we're done with acquisitions for the year, I think, I mentioned that on Q1. We talked a lot about NIC, and I said we may not be done for the year, and we did DataSpec and ReadySub. Those were deals that were already in process. And so I would expect that we'll be a little more - we may have a little bit higher bar, going forward, in the short term on that. And as it relates to share repurchases, again, we're opportunistic. We're very comfortable with our debt leverage right now. One of the things I talked about at the last quarter - at the last call was we want to make sure we retain flexibility. And I think we have that flexibility. And our combined cash flow, if we did solely dedicate it to debt, it would be paid off in fairly short order. But I always want to maintain the flexibility to invest in the business when it makes sense to do acquisitions when they make sense and to do share repurchase when they make sense. And we've got that. And so you'll see us pay down that debt in a fairly aggressive manner, but we're going to have that flexibility, and we'll open, we'll always have that flexibility.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. That's fair. And then, Brian, this may be jumping the gun to you with the question. But in terms of when NIC renews a state portal contract or any large contract, would you expect to see them flow through bookings? Or would it be like the Texas e-filing deal where there's - it's a little bit harder to quantify it given some of the terms?\nBrian Miller: Yeah, it's probably a little early to comment on that. We really need to dig into the terms of those. Typically, when we've had contracts that are solely transaction-based like our e-filing that are on a per filing basis, they don't go into bookings at the inception. They just go in as those revenues flow through our income statement, because there's not a fixed amount. It's really just our fixed fee e-filing that goes into booking, other than in the case of the Texas renewal. So we'll just have to look closely at the terms of those contracts and see how they line up with how we report. So that's part of what we'll be doing as we move through the detailed integration over the - as we prepare to report for the first time on a combined basis this quarter.\nPeter Heckmann: Okay. No problem. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.\nClarke Jeffries: Hi, this is Clarke Jeffries on for Brent. Thanks for taking the question. Firstly, I noticed the reacceleration of payments revenue, up 59% off of the strongest comp last year. Wondering, if we could get an update on the trends in that business, I know, there were some impacts in the e-filing side of the house. But are the payment trends looking like it's steadily improving from here?\nBrian Miller: They are. There's some rebound in e-filing, although, it's not dramatic. I think our e-filing revenues were up sort of mid-single-digits. But as courts open back up, we would expect to see volumes pick back up there in that transaction-based business. That does typically have a payments component. But we've talked about our own payment initiatives over the last few quarters and how we are starting to - with a sort of a newly refined go-to-market strategy. We are trying to push our payments platform into more of our customers, so increase the adoption. And we're certainly seeing increased adoption among their citizens in making payments online. We're adding new customers, and we're bringing in more payment types with those customers that do have our payments platform. So we're still in the early stages within the Tyler business of performing against that strategic objective of significantly increasing our payments business. And we really look forward to seeing how we can use the NIC payments platform and their expertise to help accelerate that. But the business on its own is doing well within Tyler, and it's had really strong growth over the last couple of years. But again, still off a much smaller base than NIC has.\nLynn Moore: Yeah, that's right, Brian. As we rollout payments, you're going to see throughout the rest of the year as we get more and more of our solutions online in the payments. We've been doing that work. We started that last year. And as Brian mentioned, really, it's - while it's still small businesses tend to grow fast. And if you look at a 3-year run rate, we're probably at 3 times the revenue as we were 3 years ago. And our Q1 actually out-beat plan, and we were up year-over-year in Q1 in our payments. So that's encouraging to see. And as Brian mentioned, our e-filing revenues are actually getting back closer to pre-pandemic levels. They're getting closer to the 80%, 85%, 90% now levels of pre-pandemic. So that's all very encouraging.\nClarke Jeffries: Great. And then, I would say one thing that - as we break part the NIC business, that stood out is, I think, Lynn, you mentioned this briefly on the 20% revenue growth on state-level contracts, is that same-state IGS growth that averaged around 15% for the last 2 years? I'm just wondering if this is an asset that could potentially accelerate post-pandemic as some of the DHR headwinds abate, and then you just have new opportunities with new states building off of revenue expansion with existing states.\nLynn Moore: Well, I think, that's a good question. I don't know it's - again, it's probably a little early for me to comment on their multiyear growth plans there as we're still doing our integration and getting our arms around 2021. But certainly, their IGS services, their same-state enterprise revenues, those are growing areas for them and those areas that we think we can help complement them and help bring even further growth. So that would be my long-term expectation. I certainly don't have anything more specific in terms of guidance around that right now.\nClarke Jeffries: All right, great, and congratulations on the quarter.\nLynn Moore: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Joe Goodwin with JMP.\nJoe Goodwin: Great. Thanks guys for taking the question and good morning. Can you comment on how Socrata performed? And then also, has there been any changes to competitive environment maybe from some other more horizontal vendors with respect to Socrata?\nLynn Moore: Yeah, no, Socrata is performing very well. One of the things that we've really put a focus on really last 18 months or so is more, we call cross-divisional bookings, but we're really pushing Socrata through Tyler's traditional sales channels as opposed to Socrata's traditional sales channels. One of the most exciting opportunities, I think, with NIC as well is the opportunity for Socrata. Socrata had a lot of state and federal customers on their own before they came to Tyler. And with Tyler, we've been focusing on driving that more at the local level. And there's a lot of interest at NIC. I mentioned earlier about our management team's meeting earlier this week. And one of the big topics of conversation was Socrata and the excitement around what they can do and push data insights at all the various state agency levels. And so, I think the outlook there is pretty good. I don't know that I've seen anything specific about a competitor that's anything new or different. Socrata has done a number of things in the pandemic, which has been helpful, but also there's been times we talk about delays. It's also been some issues. Socrata's, I felt the same thing the rest of our business has, and has not grown quite as fast in the last years as we may have anticipated. But the future of Socrata within Tyler and our Connected Communities visions and what we're trying to do, which, again, I don't know that any other company has the ability to do it. It's an important piece of that, and it's something that provides a lot of excitement both within our clients as well as within Tyler. So it's, yeah, it's doing well.\nBrian Miller: Yeah, really the ability to use that platform to provide advanced data and analytics capabilities within our existing Tyler core solutions gives us such an advantage over the horizontal competitors that aren't strictly public sector-focused and don't have that deep integration with our core products. So we started with the ERP and the analytics for finance. We've had great success with public safety. It's really created a competitive advantage for us with our New World Public Safety products by adding the Socrata Data and Analytics layers. And now, we're rolling it out with the appraisal and tax, and with the Assessment Connect product that's adding value to our tax. So as Lynn said, really focusing on driving it into our market, both through inside sales and in new sales by adding a Socrata component to new software sales.\nJoe Goodwin: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And as we have reached our allotted time for questions, I would like to return the floor to Mr. Moore for any closing comments.\nBrian Miller: Before we close, I'd like to add one clarification on an earlier question. There was a question about the $25 million decline in software and services bookings in Q1 compared to Q1 of last year. That's not just services, that's a combination of licenses and services. And most of that is related to licenses. Again, we had some large license deals in Q1 of last year. We saw a lower number of Q1 licenses booked this year in Q1. So the major part of that $25 million decline and probably about $20 million of it is in the license side and about $5 million in services, mostly related to billable travel services.\nLynn Moore: Great. Thanks, Brian, for that clarification. And thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We hope you stay safe and healthy. And if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller and myself. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year, unless we specify otherwise. Lynn? Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2021. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results in comparison with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the investor relations section of our website under the financial reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $294.8 million, up 6.6% on a GAAP basis and 6.5% on a non-GAAP basis. As you may recall, we were off to a very strong start in the first 2 months of 2020 before the COVID-19 pandemic began to significantly affect our business in March. So we're generally pleased with our growth this quarter against that comparison. Software license revenues declined 20.3%, reflecting both extended sales cycles and a high mix of subscription deals at 66% of new software contract value. Software services revenue declined 8.6% as a result of the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and our shift to remote delivery of most services resulted in a decline in billable travel revenue. On the positive side, subscription revenues rose 25.4%. We added 84 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 39 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $52 million in total contract value. In Q1 of last year, we added 131 new subscription-based arrangements and had 19 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $98 million in total contract value. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 66% of total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 73% in Q1 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 4.0 years compared to 5.9 years last year. Revenues from e-filing and online payments, which are included in subscriptions, were $26.9 million, up 22.4%. That amount includes e-filing revenue of $15.6 million, up 4.8%, and e-payments revenue of $11.3 million, up 59.3%. For the first quarter, our annualized non-GAAP total recurring revenue, or ARR, was approximately $886 million, up 12.9%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS arrangements for Q1 was approximately $302 million, up 26.3%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $108 million, up 22.4%, and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was approximately $476 million, up 4.1%. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.55 billion, up 3%. As Lynn noted, our bookings in the quarter were solid at $247 million. However, this was down 22.8% compared to a difficult comparison to Q1 of last year. Last year's first quarter bookings included several large contracts, including 2 significant follow-on SaaS deals with the North Carolina courts, with a combined contract value of approximately $38 million. For the trailing 12-month bookings were approximately $1.2 billion, down 13.3%, although they do not include the majority of the $98 million extension of our Texas e-filing contract signed in Q4 of 2020, because of certain termination provisions in that contract. If the Texas e-filing renewal was fully included, trailing 12-month bookings would have been down only 6.4%. The prior trailing 12-month bookings also included 4 significant SaaS deals with the North Carolina courts, with a combined contract value of approximately $123 million. The bookings growth rate in Q1 was also affected by a shorter average term for new subscription contracts. Our software subscription bookings in the first quarter added $10.2 million in new annual recurring revenue. Cash flow was once again very strong in the first quarter as cash from operations increased 26.4% to $71.7 million and free cash flow grew 33.9% to $61.7 million, representing an all-time high for first quarter free cash flow. We financed the NIC acquisition with a mixture of debt at very attractive rates that gives us a flexible capital structure. In March, we completed a $600 million offering of 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2026. The notes are convertible into Tyler common stock at a conversion price of $493.44, which represents a 30% premium over our closing price on March 4. On April 21, concurrent with the closing of the NIC acquisition, we entered into a new $1.4 billion senior unsecured credit facility with a group of 8 banks. The facility includes a $300 million term note due in 2024 and a $600 million term note due in 2026, both of which can be prepaid without penalty. The facility also includes a new 5-year $500 million revolving credit agreement that replaces our prior $400 million revolver. The combination of the convertible debt, term notes and revolver provide us with a great deal of flexibility. Our balance sheet remains very strong and its pro forma net leverage at the NIC closing was approximately 3.2 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. And we expect to end the year with net leverage under 2.5 times. The current blended interest rate on the $1.75 billion of debt we have outstanding today is 1.1%. We remain on track to achieve or exceed the annual revenue and EPS guidance that we communicated in February for Tyler, excluding the impact of the NIC acquisition. As Lynn mentioned, NIC also had a very strong first quarter results that exceeded their plans. We expect the NIC acquisition will be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings and EBITDA as well as to our recurring revenue mix and free cash flow per share in 2021. Because of antitrust restrictions, we took a conservative approach to our integration and strategic planning for NIC prior to closing the transaction last week. We are currently working closely with NIC's leadership to evaluate strategic growth opportunities that take advantage of the combined strengths of the 2 businesses and determine the impact on our 2021 plan. We expect to complete the fine-tuning of our joint operating and financial plans for the remainder of the year and issue 2021 guidance for the combined company during the second quarter. Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Lynn. And I would just add to that on the Rescue Plan that, the CARES Act, the first stimulus, couldn't be used by governments to replace lost revenue. And it was roughly $150 billion for states and just $150 billion for the largest cities and counties. This $350 billion goes much deeper across states and local governments. And there are very few restrictions on what it can be used for. The funding is just now becoming available to governments. Half of it available roughly now within 60 days of when it was passed. And then the other half is available 12 months from now. So we wouldn't have expected to see much impact on customers' purchasing activities and buying decisions yet. But it certainly points to an opportunity as we move through the year to provide significant relief. I'd say it's a little bit higher. As Lynn said, we saw these pauses in procurement processes in second quarter of last year, third quarter of last year, even to the fourth quarter of last year, where RFP volumes were down. Our clients were adapting to remote work. We weren't able to do in-person demos and some clients wanted to - it took a little while longer to adapt to doing a lot of those things remotely. So there were these pauses and delays in sales processes, particularly early-stage sales processes last year. And given our normal sales cycles that are 9 months to a year in typical deals, we expect that would show up in bookings now as we move into the fourth quarter, the first quarter of this year, those delays. And so, really our pipeline is still very robust. The RFP activity is picking up. So as we've said all along, it's really a matter of timing. We haven't seen deals go away. We've just seen the timing pushed out, and it's not surprising that it's showing up. And given that more of the deals are skewing toward subscription, it's more evident in the lower subscription bookings than in the license deals. Yes, it's really more the latter. The last 2 quarters have been really strong in terms of conversions picking back up again. And I think that's consistent with what we see in the new business market with more and more customers wanting to move to the subscription of the SaaS model. And as we've said, the complications of trying to remotely access some of these systems has certainly risen to the forefront during COVID and increased customers' desires to move on-premises systems into the cloud. And our relationship with AWS, our capacity that we have available through AWS and - is giving us additional ability to push conversions more aggressively into our customer base. No cancellations, but you're talking about compared to last year? Yeah, I think part of that is billable travel that runs through revenue and therefore through bookings. Last year, we were still traveling through most of the quarter, so you're going to see part of that. That's probably about $5 million of it. I'd say that, in general, the - as we move more to a cloud business, you typically see a little bit lower level of services with new cloud contracts. But I'd say most of that just goes along with the delays in some of the bookings. So along with - both on the license and subscription side, but no, we have not seen any cancellations. There have been - that's really held true throughout the whole last year. We've not seen any meaningful cancellations, either of contracts that are in progress or of projects in the pipeline, really just delays. Sorry. You weren't coming through very clearly. Could you repeat the last part of the question? Yeah, I think, that's definitely true. Typically, you will see the public sector change and evolve more slowly than the private sector. So often those things that - those trends that start in the private sector take a little bit longer to take hold in the public sector. But just like the private sector, our clients have had to move to doing things remotely, and that is, I think, a significant factor in their ongoing preference in new systems for the cloud and in the conversions from on-premise customers accelerating. Courts is a great example where courthouses were physically closed and many of them still remain closed, but courts are an essential function. And so many courts that didn't have the ability to operate their systems remote were just shut down. And we have products, for example, our virtual courts product that we accelerated bringing to market early last year that enabled courts to continue to operate remotely, licensing and permitting functions where clients have old legacy - not our clients, but public sector agencies have old legacy systems that don't allow for remote access. So you don't have people in the office processing building permits and those sorts of things that are slowing down activity. Our systems provide for that remote access, and there's certainly an accelerated interest in those. So I think, yeah, governments will, like the private sector over time look to work more remotely, and also that's a factor with NIC, the ability to interact with government and make payments remotely or online rather than coming to a government office. And as we've talked about their first quarter results, we're certainly seeing that increase in volumes as a result of that trend. We're still working through all that process. That's 1 of the reasons we aren't providing the combined guidance at this time. I would say, in general, NIC doesn't have a large deferred revenue balance on their balance sheet. Their business is more transaction-based rather than software-based. But that's certainly 1 of the factors that we're looking at closely as we develop the combined guidance. But they do tend to have less deferred revenue than, say, a pure software company. Well, it's hard to tell exactly if it's a low watermark, but we did start to see declining bookings last year in Q2. So I think our comparisons will now be against a - start to compare against pandemic-affected quarters. So really, right now, we're comparing against what was not only the last sort of pre-pandemic or pre-affected quarter, unaffected quarter, but also what was just a very strong quarter with some large deals in it. We do think there would be a catch-up. It's not likely to be sort of a dramatic 1 quarter kind of a catch-up, but the combination of, 1, the fact that these are essential systems and that the pipeline - they remain in the pipeline, the timing has just been pushed out. So, again, we're starting to see that increase in activity, those RFPs starting to pick-up again and some of those deals moving forward. So we do believe there's a catch-up. It is just a matter of timing. As we've said before, we also believe that further down the road, that the - there will be some procurements that will be accelerated that might have been - clients might have thought they had years left in existing legacy systems and the need for remote access, security concerns around some of those legacy systems will be factors that will cause them to rethink that and accelerate the replacement of those systems. They'll still need to go through buying processes. They'll still need to budget those, but we do believe that there'll be a longer-term acceleration, but that the sort of pent-up demand in the current pipeline that there will be an acceleration as that works its way out. And that would be consistent with what we saw in, for example, in the recession a decade ago. Well, we've said we'd expect to release it during the quarter. I would expect that to be roughly the end of May, beginning of June. So sometime in the next month or so, we would expect to be in a position to do that. NIC, again, we're working through not only understanding what their current plans are for the year, but really how the integration with Tyler, the ability to start to address some of our strategic initiatives and cross-selling opportunities, and what we think the timing and size of those is and how much of that will go into this year. But they're off to a strong start. As we said, overall, 10% - a little above 10% growth in their core revenues, they actually on the COVID-related revenues, significantly exceeded their plan on those, but we do expect those to wind down and not really be much of a factor after the second quarter. So their growth rate is a bit ahead of ours. And we talked about some of the strengths in their business from taking advantage of the increased desire of individuals and businesses to interact with governments digitally rather than in-person. So generally, they have a positive outlook on the year. And within the next few weeks, we expect to have that combined guidance out and be able to talk more about the plans for working together through this year. Yeah, it's probably a little early to comment on that. We really need to dig into the terms of those. Typically, when we've had contracts that are solely transaction-based like our e-filing that are on a per filing basis, they don't go into bookings at the inception. They just go in as those revenues flow through our income statement, because there's not a fixed amount. It's really just our fixed fee e-filing that goes into booking, other than in the case of the Texas renewal. So we'll just have to look closely at the terms of those contracts and see how they line up with how we report. So that's part of what we'll be doing as we move through the detailed integration over the - as we prepare to report for the first time on a combined basis this quarter. They are. There's some rebound in e-filing, although, it's not dramatic. I think our e-filing revenues were up sort of mid-single-digits. But as courts open back up, we would expect to see volumes pick back up there in that transaction-based business. That does typically have a payments component. But we've talked about our own payment initiatives over the last few quarters and how we are starting to - with a sort of a newly refined go-to-market strategy. We are trying to push our payments platform into more of our customers, so increase the adoption. And we're certainly seeing increased adoption among their citizens in making payments online. We're adding new customers, and we're bringing in more payment types with those customers that do have our payments platform. So we're still in the early stages within the Tyler business of performing against that strategic objective of significantly increasing our payments business. And we really look forward to seeing how we can use the NIC payments platform and their expertise to help accelerate that. But the business on its own is doing well within Tyler, and it's had really strong growth over the last couple of years. But again, still off a much smaller base than NIC has. Yeah, really the ability to use that platform to provide advanced data and analytics capabilities within our existing Tyler core solutions gives us such an advantage over the horizontal competitors that aren't strictly public sector-focused and don't have that deep integration with our core products. So we started with the ERP and the analytics for finance. We've had great success with public safety. It's really created a competitive advantage for us with our New World Public Safety products by adding the Socrata Data and Analytics layers. And now, we're rolling it out with the appraisal and tax, and with the Assessment Connect product that's adding value to our tax. So as Lynn said, really focusing on driving it into our market, both through inside sales and in new sales by adding a Socrata component to new software sales. Before we close, I'd like to add one clarification on an earlier question. There was a question about the $25 million decline in software and services bookings in Q1 compared to Q1 of last year. That's not just services, that's a combination of licenses and services. And most of that is related to licenses. Again, we had some large license deals in Q1 of last year. We saw a lower number of Q1 licenses booked this year in Q1. So the major part of that $25 million decline and probably about $20 million of it is in the license side and about $5 million in services, mostly related to billable travel services."

            "name": "Lynn Moore",
            "content": "Thank you, Keith, and welcome to our call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, I will have some preliminary comments on our quarter results, and then Brian will review the details. I will end with some additional comments, and then we'll take questions. Brian? Thanks, Brian. Our first quarter results exceeded our expectations, providing an exceptional start to 2021. Recurring revenues, which comprised 75% of our first quarter revenues, were strong, led by a 25% growth in subscription revenues. However, software licenses and services revenues continue to be pressured by longer sales cycles and delays in projects as clients deal with the ongoing effects of the pandemic. A favorable revenue mix with strong subscription growth, coupled with cost efficiencies, drove a 270 basis point expansion of our non-GAAP operating margin to 26.8%. Cash flow continued to be very robust as cash from operations grew 26% and free cash flow grew almost 34%. We're pleased to see signs of growing activity in our public sector markets and expect that federal stimulus under the American Rescue Plan Act will have a positive impact on government technology spending going forward. Bookings in the first quarter were solid at approximately $247 million, but were down 22.8% against a very challenging comparison with the first quarter of 2020. Our largest deal in the quarter was a SaaS arrangement for our Munis ERP solution with the City of Fresno, California valued at approximately $10 million. Other significant SaaS contracts included ERP deals with Hall County, Georgia, and Fort Smith, Arkansas. And an Odyssey Courts deal with Val Verde County, Texas. Our largest on-premises contracts include an ExecuTime time contract with the U.S. Virgin Islands, Public Safety and Brazos citations contracts with Montgomery County, New York, and Cicero, Illinois, and an EnerGov contract with the Commonwealth of The Bahamas. So far this year, we've been busy on the M&A front. On March 31, we completed 2 tuck-in acquisitions, DataSpec and ReadySub, for a total purchase price of $12 million in cash. DataSpec is a market-leading provider of software for the electronic management of veterans' claims. DataSpec's web-based Software-as-a-Service system called VetraSpec allows for secure electronic claims submission to the Federal Department of Veterans Affairs and reporting capabilities, in addition to scheduling, calendaring and payments. DataSpec offers county, state and national versions of VetraSpec, with state solutions making up majority of its implementations. The solution allows state departments to execute and analyze reports on the entire state, individual offices, regions and districts, and individual users. ReadySub is a cloud-based platform that delivers comprehensive absence and substitute teacher management solutions, serving approximately 1,000 school districts across the United States, with only approximately 20 of which overlapping with Tyler's 2,000 school district clients. The solution helps districts with the labor-intensive and demanding task of filling both planned and unplanned staff absences with the most highly qualified substitute resources. With continuous pressure due to substitute teacher shortages, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, districts can more easily retain a pool of qualified substitutes and automate the searching and filing of needed substitute spots. Additionally, ReadySub can integrate districts' payroll processes, eliminating duplicate work and streamlining related payroll tasks. Most importantly, last week, we completed the $2.3 billion cash acquisition of NIC, a leading digital government solutions and payments company that serves more than 7,100 federal, state and local government agencies across the nation. NIC delivers user-friendly digital services that make it easier and more efficient for citizens and businesses to interact with government, providing valuable conveniences like applying for unemployment insurance, submitting business filings, renewing licenses, accessing information and making secure payments without visiting a government office. In addition, NIC has extensive experience and expertise and scale in the government payments area, processing more than $24 billion in payments on behalf of citizens and governments last year, which will accelerate Tyler's strategic payments initiative. With the addition of NIC's highly complementary industry-leading digital government solutions and payment services to Tyler's broad client base and multiple sales channels, the combined company will be well equipped to address the tremendous demand at the federal, state and local levels for innovative platform services. Together, Tyler and NIC will connect data and processes across disparate systems and deliver essential products and services to all public sector stakeholders. NIC had revenues of $460.5 million and net income of $68.6 million in 2020. While NIC will cease to be an SEC reporting company, and therefore, will not issue a first quarter earnings release, they also had a very strong first quarter results that exceeded their plan. NIC's core first quarter revenues, excluding the TourHealth and COVID initiatives that are expected to wind down after the second quarter, grew more than 10% over last year. In addition, NIC's operating income, again excluding the TourHealth and COVID initiatives as well as acquisition costs, rose more than 20%. We are thrilled to welcome the more than 1,000 talented employees of NIC, DataSpec and ReadySub to the Tyler family, and look forward to realizing the tremendous benefits these transactions can bring to our collective team members and clients and to Tyler shareholders. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter. Thanks, Brian. Our team of professionals, including our new NIC team members, executed at a high level in the first quarter, driving results that surpassed expectations for both Tyler and NIC, and provided a great start to 2021. Exiting 2020, our financial position was stronger than ever, allowing us to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, including NIC, the largest acquisition in our history with a purchase price of $2.3 billion in cash. We've also been able to continue to invest in and, in some cases, accelerate all of our long-term strategic initiatives, in particular, our shift to a cloud-first approach. As a result, our competitive position has also continued to strengthen. We believe we will continue to see an acceleration of the public sector's move to the cloud, and we are in a great position to support that move. I'm happy to say that we are on track with the strategic investments in optimizing our products for the cloud that we discussed on our fourth quarter call. This quarter, we saw early indicators that our market is beginning to recover as some delayed procurement processes are moving forward and RFP activity is growing from the levels of the second half of 2020. We also expect that the $350 billion of aid to state and local governments under the American Rescue Plan Act will provide a significant measure of relief to budget pressures faced by many of our clients and prospects, and have a positive impact on recovery of our markets. One topic I've not discussed on these calls before pertains to our efforts regarding environmental and social initiatives. Tyler's culture guides our commitment to being a responsible partner in the communities where we live, work and serve our clients. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the Tyler Foundation, which since its creation has provided millions of dollars to charities and causes that positively impact our communities. Our culture is also the foundation for our belief in the importance of providing an inclusive and diverse workplace. We are proud to have been included in the Forbes America's Best Employers for Diversity list for the past 2 consecutive years. The pause in normal office occupancy and business travel due to the pandemic provided an opportunity for us to evaluate our environmental impact across our major office locations and identify opportunities to make our practices more consistent and effective. Last year, we formed an environmental task force to strengthen our sustainability efforts across our office locations and the communities we impact. We achieved a significant milestone last year by responding to Tyler's first invitation to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index survey. More than 3,500 of the world's largest publicly-listed companies provide detailed data and background to this global survey for evaluation by its independent sustainability ranking body. Completing the survey was an important opportunity for Tyler to uncover opportunities to strengthen our core responsibility strategy. We recently published our second annual corporate responsibility report, which is available on our website. This report represents a significant expansion of our reporting on our ESG efforts. And we look forward to continuing our journey and sharing our progress in this area. Finally, this week, we are virtually hosting more than 5,000 clients at Connect 2021, our annual user conference with a theme called Virtually Possible. Team members from across Tyler are providing nearly 700 hours of valuable content for our clients using our advanced virtual event platform. We are excited to be able to connect with so many clients at our virtual event, and we look forward to connecting with them in person at Connect 2022. With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A. Yeah. Thanks, Matt. That's a good question. I think right now there's still - our clients generally know the money is there. There is still a little bit of uncertainty about how to access it. There is certainly money that's been earmarked for IT modernization efforts. And so, I think what it's done is it's given our clients a little bit more confidence. I don't know that, I would say it necessarily benefits one more than the other. Although one thing that we were noticing last year was in our state business and that - our state business was off quite a bit last year, and there was a little bit of uncertainty around there. As it turns out, a lot of the state budgets were not as impacted as they first thought a year ago. And so, I think the combination of that along with this American Rescue Plan funding is providing a boost in that state area. We're starting to see that with some of the RFPs and things that we knew that were intended to come out that got delayed and we're starting to see some of that. But I'd say, across our entire product lines, I think there is reason for I'd call cautious optimism in what's going on in the markets, and a big part of that is the American Rescue Plan. Yeah, sure, Matt. I'd say a couple of things. As we mentioned in our comments, we're really just now beginning to sort of dig deep into our integration efforts and our strategic initiatives. And in fact, this week, we had the senior executives of both companies meeting face-to-face for the first time, which was exciting, and really start brainstorming. And at a high level, we already know sort of some of the major initiatives that we want to take on. And the good news is there are a lot of initiatives. And one thing that we need to do and be careful about is make sure that we prioritize them, look at some of the low-hanging fruit and look at some of the things that will have the most impact. You mentioned payments. That certainly is one of our largest initiatives. From a technical standpoint, there is still a little bit of work to do there. But NIC is the unquestioned leader in payments in the public sector at the state level, and it's a growing thing for us. What we see there is the ability to leverage our client base and get payments more at the local level and leverage their technical experience to help boost our payments. We talked about other sort of integrations and things. We talked before about their state enterprise contracts, which provide sort of hunting licenses. And in fact, it's those state contracts, which they classify as state enterprise revenues, where they go in and then they sort of - they plant a seed and then they're able to go build additional revenues from there. On their own, this first quarter, those revenues were up 20%, which is pretty exciting. And then, what we start talking about is what kind of products do we have at Tyler that we can really just go in and push there. And I don't think there's a lot of technical integration there that's going to need to be done. But that's another one of our major initiatives that we're looking at right now. Yeah, Scott. We talked about it last year. The expectation really was that, I guess I'd sort of call it the COVID hangover, would bleed into this year, and a lot of it has to do with the fact that our clients' budget cycles are July 1, June 30. And it's a good question. But at the same time, these are the deals that we've signed. And what we're starting to see is, in Q1, for example, we're starting to see more RFPs, we're starting to see more demos, and we're actually - some of the awards that we've gotten in Q1 that are not signed are actually starting to skew even more heavily toward SaaS. We don't normally talk about unsigned awards. We talked last year about how COVID was impacting different parts of our business differently. And we saw a little bit greater impact, say, more on the high-end financials, where Munis is, where a lot of our license sales are. And what we've seen so far in Q1 actually is that the awards that we're getting and the deals that are coming in are skewing at 80-plus percent to SaaS right now. So I think that overall trend that we've talked about is still going on. There's just a little bit of lumpiness and a little bit of hangover still from COVID. Yeah, Rob, that's a good point you make and you're right. We talked about it last year, how, again, the impact of COVID did impact different parts of our business differently. While we had certain areas of our business, I just mentioned the higher-end ERP, schools was an area that was definitely impacted a lot. And our business in schools was off last year. At the same time, I also mentioned last quarter that last year was a record sales year in our courts business. So it's a little bit of a - it's just different across our business. You're right, the American Rescue Plan, I do expect - there are some money that's specifically targeted for K through 12 and higher education. I think there is about $160 million, $170 million targeted for that. And I think what we're starting to see, generally, is just the more receptiveness from our clients in the schools area in terms of getting RFPs out, in terms of talking about deals. There was a - I'd say there was an area last year where it was, I wouldn't say silenced, but it was certainly muted a little bit, and that's certainly coming back. And to your point about ReadySub, you're right. That's a really exciting opportunity for us. It's kind of a small deal. And it's a deal that's not just you want substitute teacher application that can go in. It's also becoming more - that type of application is becoming more and more of a requirement in our ERP space for schools. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have over 2,000 school clients. And right now, that application is only in about 20 of them. And it's sort of the same playbook we had several years ago, we did the ExecuTime acquisition. We expect that we're going to be able to grow that product pretty well and it will be great for our inside sales channels as well as new business. Yeah, Keith, they're interactive governance services, which is, as you know, is transaction-based, that was up 16% year-over-year. So in the areas where they're really strategic and growing, they really had a really good solid first quarter. DHR was actually... Yeah. No, I know DHR, I'm going off memory here. I believe DHR was up about 4% in the quarter, give or take, which was nice to see, given that I think it was the first time they've actually increased in the quarter and maybe 4 quarters. But, as you know, that revenue is probably more stable. And again, when you look at interactive government services, they're [same store] [ph] enterprise revenues, that's really their growth drivers. And those were up nicely in Q1. I don't know that I could attribute necessarily anything geographic. I would just say, generally, as a whole, we're seeing a lot of positive signs. We talked about on-site awards. We talked about RFPs, particularly in certain areas of our business. Take, for example, in the higher-end financials, our fees are up significantly over Q3 and Q4, even while they're still down from where they would have been pre-pandemic, and so that's an encouraging sign. There were a lot of big deals that we saw maybe in our appraisal space maybe in our state space that we knew these deals, we plan on these deals coming out in 2020. And those got shut down, and we're actually starting to see those getting released. So just generally speaking, it's - there's a lot of encouragement. Again, I wouldn't say we're quite over the hump yet, but let's get another quarter of seeing this activity, but I think there's general optimism. And I think it mirrors what's going on in the country. There should be a reason for optimism as people continue to get vaccinated, as businesses continue to open up, as money continues to start flowing, people start interacting. You're going to see that flow through our business as well. Jonathan, I'd just add there, too, that - I like to look at the trends and look at the markets. And again, there's reason to believe the market is starting to come back. We talked about the Great Recession, but also what's our competitiveness disposition like in that market. And even while in the last 6, 9 months that the markets have been off a little bit, our actual win rates have actually been climbing. And so our competitive position continues to grow. And as we look at bookings, we've talked about this a lot over the years, we have a pretty steady stream, but it's always - there can always be some large skews in various quarters, because we do have parts of our business that get some really large deals. Last year, we were a little concerned about Q2 of last year, because Q2 of 2019, we had, I think, 1 of our largest deals in Tyler's history. And so that's kind of what we're competing against. And those large lumpy - those large deals will always sort of throw off a little bookings number. But when I look back at sort of the underlying thing, what's the market doing, what's our competitive position, what's our win rates, that's all trending in the direction that we'd like to see. Yeah. So I'd say, they're a little bit different, the 2 acquisitions. They're both fairly small. ReadySub like I mentioned earlier, that's probably more like the playbook out of ExecuTime. And that's a - this is cloud-native platform. It's built in AWS. It's actually the founders of former AWS engineers. There's a clear need in that space. This is something that, to your point, we can go out and we can leverage and sell across our base pretty well. I don't know that I've got some good sort of markets for that, but it's an opportunity. And again, it's not just the opportunity of rolling out through our inside sales, but it will also help our competitiveness on new deals in the schools market as it's becoming more and more of a requirement. DataSpec, I would classify it as a little bit more of a consolidation play. They were probably the leader in the veterans' benefits application space. They had 32 state customers. That gives us a lot of credibility so that we can go out as we will eventually probably migrate those customers over to our entellitrak platform, and that just makes us the leader in that space and gives us more credibility as we look to expand in the federal markets as well as the state markets. Yeah, Charlie, if I could just add there, too, I think - yeah, I mean, this is obviously - it's a top priority, right? I mean, it's our largest acquisition of all time. And we talked a little bit about before, and I think Brian mentioned in his remarks, we were in this period from signing and close this regulatory approval period. And you can take all sorts of approaches there, and we tended to take a more conservative approach. And, I'd love to be able to share those numbers with you today. But it was because of that conservative approach, we're just not quite there yet. And the way I view it is we - Tyler very well. You follow us a long time. We're always interested in the long-term. And the thought of even potentially jeopardizing or delaying that deal by getting a few weeks head start on some of the stuff, it just didn't seem worth it. But it is a top priority. I think we'll get those numbers out, as Brian said, in about a month. But we know that it's going to be accretive to earnings. We know it's going to accretive to EBITDA and all the things we mentioned before and the excitements there. And I appreciate if there's even a little bit of frustration, and part of it's just the timing around that we just closed in our earnings releases now. If we closed a month before earnings release, we've probably been ready to do this. I don't think there's necessarily a predisposition towards that. I think we're always opportunistic. And I think, at this point in time, acquisitions, we've done 3. Acquisitions will probably need to be a little more compelling. I'm not suggesting that we're done with acquisitions for the year, I think, I mentioned that on Q1. We talked a lot about NIC, and I said we may not be done for the year, and we did DataSpec and ReadySub. Those were deals that were already in process. And so I would expect that we'll be a little more - we may have a little bit higher bar, going forward, in the short term on that. And as it relates to share repurchases, again, we're opportunistic. We're very comfortable with our debt leverage right now. One of the things I talked about at the last quarter - at the last call was we want to make sure we retain flexibility. And I think we have that flexibility. And our combined cash flow, if we did solely dedicate it to debt, it would be paid off in fairly short order. But I always want to maintain the flexibility to invest in the business when it makes sense to do acquisitions when they make sense and to do share repurchase when they make sense. And we've got that. And so you'll see us pay down that debt in a fairly aggressive manner, but we're going to have that flexibility, and we'll open, we'll always have that flexibility. Yeah, that's right, Brian. As we rollout payments, you're going to see throughout the rest of the year as we get more and more of our solutions online in the payments. We've been doing that work. We started that last year. And as Brian mentioned, really, it's - while it's still small businesses tend to grow fast. And if you look at a 3-year run rate, we're probably at 3 times the revenue as we were 3 years ago. And our Q1 actually out-beat plan, and we were up year-over-year in Q1 in our payments. So that's encouraging to see. And as Brian mentioned, our e-filing revenues are actually getting back closer to pre-pandemic levels. They're getting closer to the 80%, 85%, 90% now levels of pre-pandemic. So that's all very encouraging. Well, I think, that's a good question. I don't know it's - again, it's probably a little early for me to comment on their multiyear growth plans there as we're still doing our integration and getting our arms around 2021. But certainly, their IGS services, their same-state enterprise revenues, those are growing areas for them and those areas that we think we can help complement them and help bring even further growth. So that would be my long-term expectation. I certainly don't have anything more specific in terms of guidance around that right now. Thanks. Yeah, no, Socrata is performing very well. One of the things that we've really put a focus on really last 18 months or so is more, we call cross-divisional bookings, but we're really pushing Socrata through Tyler's traditional sales channels as opposed to Socrata's traditional sales channels. One of the most exciting opportunities, I think, with NIC as well is the opportunity for Socrata. Socrata had a lot of state and federal customers on their own before they came to Tyler. And with Tyler, we've been focusing on driving that more at the local level. And there's a lot of interest at NIC. I mentioned earlier about our management team's meeting earlier this week. And one of the big topics of conversation was Socrata and the excitement around what they can do and push data insights at all the various state agency levels. And so, I think the outlook there is pretty good. I don't know that I've seen anything specific about a competitor that's anything new or different. Socrata has done a number of things in the pandemic, which has been helpful, but also there's been times we talk about delays. It's also been some issues. Socrata's, I felt the same thing the rest of our business has, and has not grown quite as fast in the last years as we may have anticipated. But the future of Socrata within Tyler and our Connected Communities visions and what we're trying to do, which, again, I don't know that any other company has the ability to do it. It's an important piece of that, and it's something that provides a lot of excitement both within our clients as well as within Tyler. So it's, yeah, it's doing well. Great. Thanks, Brian, for that clarification. And thanks, everybody, for joining us today. We hope you stay safe and healthy. And if you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller and myself. Thanks, everybody."

Our fourth quarter results marked a solid finish to an eventful year as public sector demand remained strong and SaaS adaption continues at an accelerated pace. Total revenues grew 4.3%, with organic growth excluding COVID related revenues of approximately 6% and organic revenue growth for full year was solid at approximately 8.2%. Recurring revenues comprised nearly 83% of our quarterly revenues. On an organic basis, subscription revenue grew 14.3%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth and transaction-based revenues. Most importantly, SaaS revenues included in subscriptions grew 19.3%. We achieved solid revenue growth even as the shift in new software contract mix continue to accelerate to SaaS from licenses. In Q4, 86%, of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 77% in Q4 last year. In our digital solutions division, which is formerly known as NIC, we continue to execute on cross-selling opportunities. And in Q4, we signed a significant new contract with the Kansas Department of Revenue to provide our Data and Insights Assessment Connect Solution, which will work with our Enterprise Assessment solution used statewide in Kansas. We also signed sell-through deals for our recreation dynamic solution with Utah division of outdoor recreation and the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and parks. Our Digital Solutions division also signed notable SaaS software agreements with the state of Nevada and the Alabama Alcohol Beverage Control Board. We also signed a payments processing contract with the Wisconsin Department of Motor Vehicles, which is our first payments opportunity in Wisconsin. Finally, our Digital Solutions division won a competitive rebid for our master enterprise contract with the state of Colorado\u2019s Statewide Internet Portal Authority Board, as well as an extension of our master enterprise contract with the state of Oklahoma. In other Tyler divisions, we signed seven additional significant SaaS deals, each for different product suites and each with a total contract value greater than $2 million. Those include contracts with the Cypress Fairbanks Independent School District in Texas for our student transportation solution; the cities of Prosper Texas and Glendora, California for our enterprise ERP and enterprise permitting and licensing solutions; the Placer County Water Agency in California, and the City of Helena, Montana for our enterprise ERP solution; the City of Albuquerque, New Mexico for enterprise permitting licensing solution; and Lucas County, Ohio for our enterprise justice solution. In addition to those deals, we signed 12 SaaS deals in the quarter, with contract values between $1 million and $2 million each. In the fourth quarter, we signed 153 new payments deals worth more than $4.7 million in estimated annual recurring revenue across Tyler divisions, other than digital solutions. The largest of those was an agreement to provide payment processing for the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was estimated annual revenues of more than $1.2 million. For the full year 2022, we signed 571 new payments deals, with more than $13 million in annual recurring revenue, many of which we were able to pursue because of the new capabilities that came to us with NIC. More than 80% of those were sold to existing Tyler software clients. New payments only agreements typically have a lag of three to six months between signing and revenue generation. While payments agreements that are embedded in a broader solution, such as new ERP sale, may have a period of 6 to 18 months from signing to revenue generation.  In our justice group, we signed two notable multi suite license deals in the quarter for enterprise public safety, enforcement mobile and data insight solutions with Stearns County, Minnesota and Richland County, Ohio. We also signed two significant license contracts for our Enterprise Justice Solution with Midland County, Texas and Kankakee County, Illinois, which also include our Enterprise Solution - Supervision solution. Now, I\u2019d like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for \u201823.\nBrian Miller: Thank you, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $452.2 million, up 4.3% and 4.2%, respectively. Organic revenue growth, excluding COVID-related revenues, with 6% on a GAAP basis and 5.8% on a non-GAAP basis. COVID-related revenues for the quarter were $3.5 million compared to $16.6 million in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Revenues from all of our COVID-related initiatives have now officially ended. Licensed revenue declined over 60% as our new software contract mix continued to shift to SaaS at an accelerated pace. Professional services revenue rose 2.8% and 8.5% organically. And we intend to continue to grow our implementation teams in 2023 to support delivery of our growing backlog and pipeline that will likely continue to see some pressure on professional services revenue in the near-term as the teams ramp up to become fully billable. Subscriptions revenues increased 11.9% and organically rose 14.3%. We added 140 new SaaS arrangements and converted 82 existing on-premises clients to SaaS, with a total contract value of approximately $99 million. In Q4 of last year, we added 135 new SaaS arrangements and had 71 on-premises conversions, with the total contract value of approximately $74 million. Our software subscription bookings in the fourth quarter added $21.4 million in new ARR. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 86% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 77% in Q4 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this year, this quarter was 3.9 years consistent with last year. Transaction-based revenues, which includes state enterprise portal, payment processing and E-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $146.5 million, up 6.9%. E-filing revenue reached a new high of $19.8 million, up 12.7%. Our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $150 billion - I\u2019m sorry, $1.50 billion, up 7.5%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was $440.6 million, up 18.5%. Transaction-based ARR was $586.2 million, up to 6.9% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was slightly down at $469.1 million due to the continued shift of new clients and migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. Operating margins in the quarter were pressured by the acceleration of the shift to the cloud in new business and the related decline in license revenues as well as by an increase in R&D expense as certain development costs that we had expected to capitalize were expensed. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was a new high of $1.89 billion, up 5.2%. Bookings in the quarter were approximately $464 million, which was flat with last year. On an organic basis bookings were approximately 354 million up 2%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately 1.9 billion, up 9.5% and on our organic basis were approximately 1.4 billion up 1.6%. Capital expenditures for the year totaled $50.1 million below our Q3 guidance of $58 million to $62 million, primarily because of the reduction and capitalized software development that drove higher R&D expense. Cash flows from operations were 121.9 million up 6% and free cash flow was 114.7 million up 20.6%; both represented a new high for the fourth quarter.  We continue to strengthen our already solid balance sheet throughout 2022. During the fourth quarter, we repaid $90 million of our term debt and since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $755 million of debt. We ended the year with outstanding debt of 995 million and cash and investments of approximately 229 million. As a reminder $600 million of our debt is in the form of convertible debt with a fixed interest rate of a quarter of a percent. The remaining $395 million in pre-payable term debt due in 2024 and 2026 with interest in flooding rates based on LIBOR plus a margin of 125 or 150 basis points. Thus our exposure to floating rates is limited. Beginning in February 2023 SOFR has replaced LIBOR as our reference rate. We also have an undrawn $500 million revolver. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 1.64 times trailing 12 months pro EBITDA. We\u2019ve also issued our initial guidance for 2023. Please keep in mind that our outlook for 2023 includes no COVID related revenues as those initiatives were completed in the fourth quarter. For the year 2022 COVID related revenues totaled $51 million with $10.8 million in subscriptions, and 40.2 million in professional services. In addition, another revenue headwind that is factored into our guidance is the shift of two of our digital solutions state enterprise agreements from the gross to the net model for payments resulting in a 10.5% million reduction in revenues, although with a positive impact on margins. Our 2023 guidance is as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.935 billion and $1.970 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8%. To add more color to our revenue expectations, we expect growth by revenue line to be in the following approximate ranges. Subscription revenues will grow in the mid teens. Professional services revenues will decline in the high single digits but excluding COVID revenues will grow in the high single digits. License and royalty revenues will decline approximately 30% or more. Maintenance will decline in the low single digits. Appraisal services will grow in the high single digits and hardware and other revenue will be relatively flat. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.10 and $4.25 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option activity on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.50 and $7.65. Well, we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, we do expect first quarter EPS to be in the range of Q4, 2022 EPS with a significant sequential increase in Q2. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $26 million including approximately $5 million of non-cash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. And finally, while we don\u2019t give specifically guidance on free cash flow, we want to point out a change in taxes that we expect will have a significant impact on our cash taxes and therefore our free cash flow. The tax cut and jobs act required that starting in 2022 research and experimentation expenditures known as Section 174 costs are required to be capitalized and amortized over either five years for expenditures in the U.S. or 15 years for those incurred outside the U.S. for tax purposes. Since the enactment of the TCJA businesses, including us have been monitoring congressional actions around this rule, and there was a strong expectation that section 174 would be repealed or delayed. However, Congress has not yet taken action. While the section 174 change has a slight favorable impact on our tax rate it significantly accelerates the timing and amount of our cash tax payments. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Lynn.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. During 2022, we achieved notable milestones towards several key strategic initiatives. We made meaningful progress on our cloud journey through continued investment in cloud optimization, and moving to cloud only deployment for many of our core solutions. Our intentional innovation is based on knowing our clients and anticipating their future knees. As you recall, in 2019, we launched a strategic shift from a cloud agnostic model to a cloud first model to deliver secure, scalable, dependable and compliant digital infrastructure. We\u2019re pleased to see the accelerated pace of cloud adoption amongst our new clients, as well as the steady increasing pace of cloud migrations of on-premises clients. Additionally, we integrated our Tyler and NIC payments teams and launched a significant go to market strategy for payments with a growing and active pipeline. During the year, we added 571 new payments clients with the vast majority at the local level. We leveraged our strong relationships across state and local agencies, including the NIC state enterprise contracts, to expand our cross sell opportunities with significant multi solution deals that demonstrate the power of our One Tyler approach. We\u2019re still in the early stages of cross sell, and it\u2019s exciting to see tremendous momentum and collaboration taking place. Since completing the acquisition of NIC synergies between NIC and Tyler have delivered 19 cross sell transactions worth $9.5 million in total contract value.  Overall, the year was highlighted by significant wins highly successful upsell efforts and state renewals and expansions. Throughout the year, we also demonstrate a balanced yet opportunistic approach across our business and with respect to capital allocation. We maintain a strategic lens toward acquisitions and close three transactions that bring innovative and robust offerings to elevate our digital solutions payments business, broaden our integrated solutions, and add new technology. All three acquisitions Quadrate, USC Direct and Rapid Financial Solutions support a unified client experience and further our connected communities vision to support thriving communities through a common digital foundation for better data access, engagement, and transparency. As we move into 2023, I\u2019ve never been more confident about Tyler\u2019s long term prospects. This is an important year in our cloud transition. And we are tracking well with our cloud optimization product development efforts and the plan to exit from our proprietary data centers in 2024 and 2025. We expect to reach an inflection point in our cloud transition in 2023 with a significant decline in licensed revenues that are being replaced by valuable long term recurring SaaS revenue. As a result of the short term revenue headwinds from this mix shift, together with bubble costs related to SaaS transition, including duplicate costs of operating our proprietary data centers, while moving our hosting to AWS operating margins are expected to trough this year. The estimated impact of bubble costs on our 2023 non-GAAP operating margin is approximately 130 basis points. We are committed to returning to a trajectory of consistent operating margin expansion beginning in 2024. In fact, you\u2019ll see in our upcoming proxy statement that we have added operating margin expansion as a second metric for our long term incentive plans for our senior leadership.  Our move to cloud first builds long term value and supports multiple long term growth drivers. In the midterm over the next five to seven years, we\u2019ve talked about annual organic revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range, with consistent long term margin expansion of at least 50 to 100 basis points a year beginning in 2024 excluding the impact of merchant PCs from payments expansion. We continue to refine our Tyler 2030 plan and look forward to sharing our longer term vision and clearly defined targets for revenue, margin and payments growth during an investor day planned for mid year. Look for more details on that soon. When we look at our operating margins, it\u2019s also important to consider the impact that growth in our payments business has on margins. We recognize revenues for payment processing under multiple revenue models. A gross model for agreements, where we are responsible for merchant fees on the transactions, a net model where a client assumes direct responsibility for merchant fees, and a revenue sharing model similar to the net model where we are effectively reselling a third party processor services. The majority of NIC\u2019s payment processing is under the gross model. And in 2022, we paid a total merchant fees of approximately $145 million with a small margin earned on those fees. If those same contracts were on a net basis, our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin would have been approximately 200 basis points higher. Our operational and financial discipline coupled with a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity allow us to aggressively manage our debt profile and moderate the impact of rising interest rates. And delevering continues to be a priority for capital allocation. While the bar is high for acquisitions, we continue to have the flexibility to evaluate M&A prospects that present compelling strategic growth opportunities. To close I\u2019m proud of our team Tyler team and what we continue to accomplish every day even amid macro economic uncertainty. As you\u2019ve seen in our press releases, we received many industry and regional accolades, which is a testament to our work ethic, our culture, and our tireless efforts to support our clients\u2019 needs. We also receive gratifying recognition for our environmental, social and governance practices, being named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the second consecutive year. The DJSI cited are notable gains in IT security, risk analysis, privacy protection, and human capital development. In addition, we were recently named to Newsweek\u2019s list of America\u2019s greatest workplaces for diversity. We\u2019re proud of these recognitions, and remain committed to sustainable business practices. With that, we\u2019d like to open up the line for Q&A. \nOperator: We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. \nSami Badri: Hi, thank you very much. And I had a question about the margin troughing in \u201823 and maybe you could just give us color on the ramp on from the bottom of \u201823 what should we be thinking about where margins could go in \u201824? And I think the big thing here is maybe you could give us color on like, what are some reasons why the bounce off the trough could be faster versus slower? And what are some things that could influence the speed of the margin movements?\nBrian Miller: Yes. I think it\u2019s still a little early for us to give much color around sort of how we see that trajectory playing out in 2024 and over the midterms over the next five to seven years. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect to have an Investor Day around mid-year and provide more detail on that, but we\u2019re still refining those models. So not really able to give a lot of color around that. As we\u2019ve talked about some of the factors that give us confidence that we do return to margin expansion in 2024, particularly around the wind down of some of the bubble costs as we exit our first data center. We think that this year, actually, we sort of reached that inflection point where the impact of declines in licenses are offset by the current stream of recurring revenues from subscriptions. I think in terms of the factors that could make that go faster or slower certainly one of those is the speed at which our payments business grows. And Lynn talked a little bit about the impact that has on our blended margins. But on the software side, I think that the trajectory around the speed of the flips from our on-premise customers will have an impact on that. Some of the other efficiency gains and product optimizations as we wrap those up the ability to improve lower hosting costs, I think the speed at which those work their way into the model will also be a factor in how that trajectory, how fast that trajectory plays out. \nLynn Moore: Yes, I think just to amplify on that we\u2019ve talked over the last couple of years we\u2019re about three or four years or so into this cloud transition. And we\u2019ve talked about sort of the two pieces of it, the getting dealer side on the revenue side, and then sort of getting the other side on the cost and expense side. And as Brian mentioned, on the revenue side, we\u2019re seeing that sort of inflection point it\u2019s going to take place, probably later this year. And last couple of years, the last licenses has been a significant impact. And our internal models are now showing that really the new flips, the gains from flip as well as the SaaS business over the last couple of years, is going to later this year, sort of past that point of where we lost licenses. Remember, back in 2019, we did just over $100 million in licenses. So it\u2019s a significant change that we\u2019ve been running through the financials. And then when you look on the cost side each years go by, as these, as time goes by, we\u2019re getting better and better visibility where we are making progress on optimizing our products. We\u2019re making more progress on our plans to exit our proprietary data centers. We\u2019re getting better data on how our products are actually operating within the public cloud. And so a lot of that stuff gives us that confidence that 2023 is that margin trough. As we look out farther there\u2019s other things that we\u2019re doing as well. We have a lot of internal initiatives around efficiencies, things like consolidating just some of our internal IT. We have other sort of satellite data centers that we\u2019re looking to collapse, as well as things like looking at real estate and stuff like that. So there\u2019s a lot of initiatives around that, which I think give us that confidence when we talk about \u201823 being sort of the margin trough.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you for that color. I want to shift gears a little bit and just talk about your end market, your customers, the funding flywheel. We\u2019ve clearly started to see some companies that are indexed to federal state and municipal budgets start to see the benefit of funds flowing in. They could be coming in from ARPA, some of them are still coming in from the Cares Act. And just in general, state and local budgets are up or up a lot, I guess, in 2022, fiscal 2022, and look like they\u2019re going to be up low-single digits in fiscal year \u201823 which means like the base level of state and local budgets are just much higher than what we\u2019ve really seen before. Have you been able to identify some of those incremental lifts in those budget allocations or federal funds start to come into the business in the form of contracted revenue or bookings? \nLynn Moore: I think the answer is probably similar to what we\u2019ve said in the past. I would say, as I look at our clients budgets, they\u2019re generally very healthy. As I\u2019ve mentioned, before, they were not as impacted by COVID, as people thought. They are having access to federal funds. Some of it, Brian, the timetables of one that they still have a couple of years, I think it\u2019s been there. So we\u2019re just generally seeing healthy budgets, healthy buying seasons, sort of just a really good, robust market. In terms of identifying specific deals there are occasions for that. But I think really, what it does is it\u2019s more about just overall confidence in our clients being willing to spend money. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver with Baird. Your line is now open. \nRob Oliver: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning, Lynn, one for you. You mentioned the milestones on the cloud side since 2019 when you pivoted to the cloud-first approach and certainly, seems like those are paying off, particularly with new business around subscription definitely felt that among your customers in Indianapolis last year talking to them about their readiness for cloud. But I wanted to ask a little bit about you talked about new flips. How should we think about the pace of conversions? This is clearly going to be an important driver here. They are up modestly from last year, nothing to really write home about. So can you just help us understand how you\u2019re thinking about maybe success relative to conversions and migrations of existing customers this year and then I had a quick follow up for Brian. Thanks.\nLynn Moore: Yes. Sure. Robin. I think you\u2019re right. I flipped actually, I think there are quite a bit year-over-year. I think this year, we did about 336 flips. Last year, we did about 239 flips give or take. So roughly 40%. I see flips being a significant driver of revenue growth over the next five to seven years. I see them continuing to grow at a healthy pace. And I don\u2019t really, I\u2019m not in a position to tell you that we\u2019re going to grow North of 15%, 20% each year, but we have a wide and deep customer base, that has become a priority, and we\u2019re prioritizing our flips internally.\nRob Oliver: And then Brian, just one on the Q4 operating margin was a bit below our expectations. And that could be driven indeed, by those flips, or by NIC but just wanted to get a little bit more color on that. Thanks. \nBrian Miller: Yes, I\u2019d say probably the two biggest factors, there were one that licenses declined pretty significantly. And we\u2019ve talked about that expectation, kind of going into 2023 but Q4 had a bit of a deeper decline from the mix of new business. So licenses were relatively low number. And, again, most of that is a shift in the mix as opposed to less new business. We did as we typically have with our more license heavy products and public safety and platform technologies some slippage out of the quarter in terms of timing, but that\u2019s pretty typical. So I\u2019d say that the lower licenses were the big factor. And then probably the other factor is the higher R&D expense that we mentioned were some expenses that we had expected to be capitalized were actually expense because of the nature of the development efforts. And so that impacted our margins as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt VanVliet with BTIG. Your line is now open. \nMatt VanVliet: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess looking at the margin guide for \u201823 Brian and just trying to reconcile kind of where we were previously to maybe some of the moving parts and you just mentioned the R&D coming in higher on a expense level than capital wonder if you could sort of quantify how much of that sort of changed versus what you were previously expecting and looked like around maybe 6 million flip from capitalized to expense in the fourth quarter. Curious if you have a general sense of what that level will be in \u201823. And then secondarily, just how much of the compression on the EBIT or on the operating margin side is from the declining license mix versus the bubble costs versus those R&D expenses. Thanks.\nBrian Miller: Yes. So yes, for the full year, the difference in the capitalize versus expensed R&D versus our expectation was close to $9 million. We gave guidance for R&D for next year, in the range of $108 million to $110 million that\u2019s expensed and our capitalized R&D in 2023 is expected to be in the high 30s, say around $37 million. So capitalization is a little bit higher, but R&D expense is higher in 2023. If you look at the sort of the midpoint of our guidance, it implies I\u2019d say somewhere between 60 and 100 basis points of operating margin compression in total and we mentioned that the bubble costs are estimated to be about 130 basis points of impact on 2023 margins. \nMatt VanVliet: New bubble cost?\nBrian Miller: New bubble costs. So and that\u2019s higher than the impact was in 2022. We talked about those as being a little less than 100 basis points of impact and that\u2019s to be expected, because we continue to move more customers into the public cloud and while we still operating our two data centers and so the duplicate costs expand this year, and we\u2019ve talked about an expectation in the first half of 2024 that will be out of the first data centers and that\u2019ll start to mitigate.\nMatt VanVliet: Okay, very helpful. And then looking at just trying to square together some of the numbers with the commentary, it sounds like the subscription side and certainly SaaS embedded within that continues to perform quite well. And you\u2019re seeing not only new customers, but the flips, sort of at elevated rates. But definitely look at the backlog numbers on the subscription side, there was a slight decline sort of quarter-over-quarter, while maintenance continued to climb. So just curious if there were, I guess any mix of some of the renewals that maybe were anticipated the flip that maybe didn\u2019t in the quarter or anything on that front that would sort of lead to the optics of the subscription backlog declining slightly, while the sort of looking ahead version and the qualitative commentary around strong bookings would push more to the subscription side, maybe in \u201823 than what we saw in Q4.\nBrian Miller: Yes, I think one of the bigger factors around backlog I think backlog is probably becomes maybe a little less meaningful or less of a full picture when you look at it is really around how the accounting drives what goes into backlog and what doesn\u2019t. So transaction revenues don\u2019t sit in the backlog. So as we add new payments or new portal revenues, those typically are under fixed arrangements so even though they may be highly predictable and recurring. So there typically wouldn\u2019t be an addition to backlog for those.  And then we\u2019ve talked in the past as well about sometimes the terms of a contract agreement dictate how much goes into backlog. So for example, a termination for convenience provision can significantly limit that we saw that with a really large contract last quarter. That was a 50 plus million dollar contract that only $8 million went into backlog because that\u2019s a termination for convenience provision. So I think there\u2019s a lot of factors that start to make the backlog number maybe less of an important metric to look at how we expect to perform going forward. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nPeter Heckmann: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I have a few just clarifications there. And I may have missed some detail. So forgive me if I\u2019m repeating myself. But when we look at bookings we typically see this quarter as a big public safety bookings quarter. Can you talk about how they are receiving the idea of converting to subscription? And then just clarifying, were there any deals with containers in bookings in the quarter that were greater than 5 million of TCB?\nLynn Moore: Yes. Sure Pete. On the public safety side, it is typically a little bit larger quarter. we don\u2019t typically talk about deals that we\u2019ve awarded, but not signed. I will say that we had a couple of deals that were of significance that that pushed for the quarter. We are continuing to see more and more acceptance on the public safety side to the SaaS model and to subscriptions. And I think we\u2019re going to continue to see that going forward. It\u2019s part of our actual in our budget process. If you look generally across Tyler, I think for next year on a sort of an overall weighted value average, we\u2019re expecting north of 90%, 91% of deals next year to be in SaaS with a significant increase on the public safety side, still less than half on the public safety side. But it is something that we\u2019re doing some modeling and some things that we\u2019re trying to do to sort of push that model with our clients.\nBrian Miller: Yes, and this quarter, we did not have any individual contracts that were more than $5 million in total contract values. We had a couple in the $4 million range on the software side. We did have a competitive rebid when, with our state enterprise agreement in Colorado, which is one of our bigger states. And certainly the total value of that contract over the five year term is well above $5 million. But on the software side, no individual deals more than 5 million. So it was more of a high volume sort of more mid range deals this quarter. \nPeter Heckmann: Got it. And so to your point that bookings might be come up with slightly less useful metric given how you gross up the TCB related to variable revenue streams and contracts. I missed what you said on the 500 and some payments deals. What was the TCB related to that and then can you get given an approximation of how much that was included in for your bookings? Did it have just been your estimate of the first year? \nBrian Miller: Yes, and actually on the payment deal, that there really wouldn\u2019t be anything that in the bookings number, only the actual revenues as they come through in a given quarter basically run through bookings and revenue at the same time. So for payments, we don\u2019t include it again, because they\u2019re not a fixed amount. We don\u2019t include those in bookings or in backlog. But those payments deals for the full year we estimate that they\u2019ll add more than $13 million in annual recurring revenues. And there\u2019s a mixture of contracts there that are either gross or net processing through our platform and still some deals that are through our reseller arrangements where we have a revenue sharing arrangement. So the revenues are lower but the margins are higher on those. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. \nAlex Zukin: Yes, hey, guys. So maybe just two for me. I guess the first one just similar to one of the questions, I think that\u2019s been asked, but maybe on a slightly different metrics. Again, the subscription ARR added in the quarter this quarter seemed to be lower sequentially than the last two. So just maybe clarifying what drove that from a bookings perspective? And then more broadly, as we are much more geared towards subscription and SaaS, how should we think about at least how were you guys thinking about kind of net new SaaS ARR, net new kind of subscription bookings growth for \u201823? And then I have got a quick follow up on cash flow.\nBrian Miller: Well. We expect, clearly we expect the subscription booking and subscription ARR will accelerate from 2022 and 2023, both on the transaction side and the SaaS software side. Part of that, again, the change in the mix accelerating in a more significant decline in licenses this year with that being replaced by new subscription arrangements. I think the question about just the new subscription ARR again, that number really just relates to new software deals. And as you said, there weren\u2019t any mega deals in this quarter. But a good volume of sort of midsized deals. I think more that\u2019s just around the timing. We\u2019ve said that the pipeline continues to be very strong. RFP activity remains generally stable at pretty elevated levels of the market activity supports that expectation that we\u2019ll continue to see an accelerating rate of new software ARR. \nAlex Zukin: And then I guess, Brian, from a free cash flow perspective, when you think about the lag or the delta between operating margins and free cash flow for this year, it\u2019s obviously a little bit higher than in previous years, given some of the items you mentioned around tax and expense or capitalization versus some R&D expenses. As we think about it for \u201823 and even more so for \u201824. What\u2019s the right expectation for free cash flow margins versus operating margins? And that delta specifically in these two years as we kind of trough margins and transition to SaaS? \nBrian Miller: Yes, I think, generally, we would expect that and we talked about what are our capitalization, our CapEx, both software and non-software CapEx is for 2023. That\u2019s a bit higher. And some of that\u2019s related to software CapEx and some of that\u2019s related to facilities investments that we\u2019re making in a couple of particular locations as expected in \u201824, that that CapEx would decline. In general, I think our cash flow margin would grow in line with a faster than our operating margin. Once that CapEx starts to normalize. The impact of the Section 174, which is still a bit unclear, will be significant on cash flow in 2023. Because if it stands, if it\u2019s not repealed, and we\u2019re not the first company or the first software company to talk about this, you\u2019re starting to see more of it. I know Microsoft talked about a more than billion dollar impact on their taxes. But if it stands and isn\u2019t repealed or delayed, that our cash tax payments will be significantly higher this year because we\u2019ll have the impact of both sort of catching up the 2022 taxes under that assumption and making cash tax payments related to 2023. So it could be in the 100 million dollar range of additional cash taxes this year, which would really, as I said, the two years impact, roughly $50 million related to 2022 and 50, related to 2023 in round numbers. So we\u2019ll see how that plays out. But that\u2019s sort of the current expectation. And given the way that tax change works, it will impact cash taxes for five years until it normalizes and you\u2019re putting on the same amount that you\u2019re amortizing.\nAlex Zukin: Understood, so, I guess, is it fair once we get through \u201823 and CapEx starts to trend down would you expect it to kind of go back to that historical still 200 to 300 point delta between margins and free cash flow margins? operating margin? \nBrian Miller: I think that\u2019s fair. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabriella Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. \nGabriella Borges: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Lynn I want to follow up on some of your comments on the demand environment. I think last quarter, you talked about procurement cycle stretching out a little bit, maybe just give us an update there and are you seeing any issue positive or negative with this topic shortages, negative being bottlenecking on procurement and positive being, hey, we don\u2019t have enough work through we need to accelerate our adoption of technology at your customer base. \nBrian Miller: Gabri, I don\u2019t. Right now, procurement cycles are pretty normal. They\u2019re going in line with our clients budgets are healthy. And we\u2019re not really seeing delayed procurement cycles right now. Again, from our perspective, the market is relatively healthy, their budgets are healthy, and our competitive position remains strong. So we\u2019re seeing a pretty normal, really above normal market.\nGabriella Borges: My follow-up is on competitive position. So as you think about the progress you\u2019ve made with your cloud transition, and really leaning into that, is there a scenario where you see a pace of share gain, or your pace of displacement incumbents accelerate? Is that something you potentially are already seeing, and that\u2019s something that could be on the cards a little bit on how it advantages you competitively? Thank you.\nBrian Miller: I\u2019ll take, I\u2019ll start on that and Lynn can add to that. We do think that in our space, that the shift to the cloud and our cloud strategy gives us a competitive advantage. As you know, we compete across products with different competitors, and generally in each of our products suite. And those range from some very large companies to a lot of smaller, more niche e-companies. And we think that where we are in the cloud transition, is well in advance of where a lot of our competitors are. And as that desire, on our client base to move to the cloud accelerates that gives us an advantage and an ability to increase our share because of where we are in our cloud transition. And then, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, our connected communities vision, and the fact that we have this broad suite of products that work increasingly well together, continues to provide us with a competitive advantage there in clients that are looking for a sweet solution. And we think that this could be one of our strengths.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays, Your line is now open. \nSaket Kalias: Okay, great. Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Lynn maybe start with you. That was helpful detail in your prepared remarks just on the composition of NIC or digital payments. When it comes to gross versus net? Maybe the question is, Could you put a finer point, just on how much of that digital payments business or the transaction revenue one is gross versus net and then relatedly, how you maybe think about that mix going forward? \nLynn Moore: Yes, I\u2019ll start and varnish probably got better numbers. NIC which in our digital solutions division, I would say the overwhelming majority of their payments business was on a gross basis. I would say on the Tyler side beforehand, more of it\u2019s been on the net basis. That\u2019s actually not a lever that we fully control. It\u2019s generally controlled by the customer and whether or not the customer is wants to take the risk and on the interchange fees or if not, there\u2019s a number of factors that go into there. But as of right now, a substantial part of Tyler\u2019s overall business is on the gross model because of NIC and more NIC was how mature and vast that business was. We\u2019ve got the number for merchant fees that we passed through last year was about I think, on the NIC side was about $142 million. And maybe just a handful of $3 million, $4 million, $5 million on the Tyler side. And looking at it next year I think NIC side is probably more around 145-ish million again with the same few million more on top from Tyler. \nBrian Miller: I don\u2019t know that. I have a lot to add to that. It clearly is the vast majority. We did mention that a couple of our date enterprise agreements that digital solutions are shifting in 2023 to net from gross and that\u2019s got about a $2.5 million impact. But as Lynn said, we don\u2019t really fully control that. And so I would expect that still going forward, the majority of the business comes to us through the gross model where we\u2019re paying the merchant fees which is why we wanted to sort of give you the apples to apples comparison of the margin impact of a couple of 100 basis points, if all of those net ones were on the gross model, and you took the merchant fees out of the revenue side. So I would say that as more Tyler customers that have traditionally been on a sort of a reseller with third party payment processors, where we get a revenue share, which is a net accounting, as more of those overtime migrate to our proprietary platform, we could have a shift with from those customers that are currently on a net basis moving to a gross basis with Tyler. The net result is we keep more of the transaction. So we make more money. We\u2019d have higher revenues, but it would have a negative impact on margins. And we\u2019ll attempt at our investor day to provide more color on how those work and how we see that playing out. Because clearly significant growth in the payments business is an objective of ours and something that we\u2019re having a lot of success with and expect to continue to.\nSaket Kalias: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Brian, maybe for my follow up, and apologies. I think this question has been asked a couple different ways. I just, I want to one other way. The question is, maybe how SaaS ARR did versus your own expectations this quarter? I think you said that maybe it was timing. We expect SaaS ARR to accelerate next year. I think it grew about 19% this quarter. I know the last quarter had some big deal activity that maybe makes it a tough sequential compare. But I\u2019m just kind of curious how you think about sort of that that SaaS ARR growth trajectory this year? And if there\u2019s anything that we should keep in mind, for how that performed this quarter versus your expectations? \nBrian Miller: Yes, I think it was generally in line with our expectation. I don\u2019t know that it was significantly varied from plan. I guess one other factor that plays into that is the lag between when we sign a SaaS deal and when we start to recognize revenues. And that can vary, but it can be typically the implementations are quicker or the time from signing to starting to recognize revenues is quicker on a SaaS deal than on an on-prem deal. But that can vary and that can typically be, say six months that can be longer. And so I think when I talk about timing, it\u2019s more around the difference between when we signed something and when we\u2019re starting to recognize revenues.\nLynn Moore: I\u2019d say there\u2019s two things around timing one is, just as Brian mentioned, yes in the old days, when you sign an on-prem license, you recognize the entire license upfront. On a SaaS deal, particularly when we\u2019re doing multi suite, multi module deals, they\u2019re generally going to start paying those when those particular modules or pieces go live. So you\u2019ve got to delay from the time you sign to where you get first parts of the customer up live. But as you continue that implementation and other pieces go live, then you will get that build up. I say the other side is when you look at flips there\u2019s things around flips that while long term, obviously provide really great long term value and the short term sometimes we\u2019re providing some services, perhaps that discount or no charge. There also might be some concessions depending on how long the customer has had their license and where they sit. And so to sort of incentivize the flip, there\u2019s sometimes some sort of upfront concession, which can then create another lag factor before you get the full value of that flip.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to I guess, touch a little bit about cross sell activity which you spoke about quite a bit. Is there anything that we could expect to see either inflect or grow even more for 2023 as the NIC relationship has had a little bit more time to mature and with some of the new acquisitions.\nBrian Miller: Yes, Jonathan, I mean, cross selling is one of our major mid to long term growth drivers. It\u2019s something we\u2019re talking about internally, as you look out over the next seven, eight years to about Tyler 2030. And things that can, quote, really move the needle. It\u2019s these things like flips, its payments, it\u2019s cross selling, it\u2019s also a lot of other things that we do really well. And we\u2019ve talked about areas of our business like supervision, where the where the market is good, where the TAM is good, and where we\u2019re making really big gains there. But cross selling is something that we\u2019re prioritizing across all of Tyler, where we\u2019ve actually started some new sort of strategic account management approach within NIC and bringing other resources, getting even further exposure to our sales channels, our sales leads. There are things that we will be working on in terms of internally around how we recognize revenue from cross sells, and how we incentivize things and structurally internally, things that we need to sort of clear out some of those barriers to sort of unleash that power even more. We\u2019re pretty excited about it. I mean we had probably this past quarter, probably one of the best stories we\u2019ve had in a long time in terms of both cross selling and sort of connected communities which was the Kansas Department of Revenue story that I mentioned in my opening remarks. This was a deal where this deal took place because of our DNI solution around assessments, and the fact that we had such a broad footprint and presence within the state of Kansas from our enterprise assessment. But it also didn\u2019t happen without NIC and their contacts at the state and utilizing that state master contract. So that was three different pieces of our organization coming together to create a really great result and something that I think we can replicate across other states that deals a $600,000, AAR deal, really an ideal, but really took the efforts of multiple divisions to do that. And I think that\u2019s sort of an example of what we\u2019re looking to do in the future. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open. \nUnidentified Analyst: Yes, guys, it\u2019s actually Peter on for Kirk. Appreciate taking the questions. So maybe, Brian, just one for you. Curious are we at the point where there should sort of be more stability in terms of the impact of this subscription transition on revenue versus your guidance? I mean, I think we all get the moving target, but just curious if the level of dispersion is likely to go down from here on that, in that sense?\nBrian Miller: Yes, I think so. We certainly expect a bigger decline in licensed revenues this year. Licenses are always the most, or the least predictable of our revenue streams at least in the short term. And so now with well into the 80s, is the percentage of our revenues that are recurring. There\u2019s much less, a much higher level of predictability. So I think we\u2019re definitely kind of around that corner. And in that there should be an increasingly higher level of confidence around our outlooks versus what we actually where results come in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Your line is now open. \nTerry Tillman: Hey, good morning. Thanks for filling me in. Unfortunately, for you all still have some more questions, even though a bunch have been answered. Maybe Lynn the first question for you. It\u2019s kind of a twofold first question. And then Brian, I was going to ask you about payments. So Lynn, in terms of those couple of larger public safety deals that slid into the first half. Do you expect those pulls in the first quarter? And then the second part of that first question for you is, you had a great deal last quarter with the Department of State and I know it\u2019s still small in terms of the federal sector for you all. But just anything you can share about optimism in more we could hear this year on that side. And then I want to ask you about payments, Brian? \nLynn Moore: Yes, my expectation is that at least one of those larger deals is on track to close in Q1. As it relates to Tyler federal. I think you\u2019re right. I mean, things that I\u2019m seeing that\u2019s coming out of that that division, in terms of sales indicators, the pipeline, the volume of deals is up significantly since year-over-year. We\u2019re also seeing interesting going up more and more movement in the federal side to SaaS, which is good to see. It\u2019s something that we put an internal focus on in the last two years. And we\u2019re starting to see more of that receptiveness there. So I think there\u2019s positive things coming out of the federal space. And I like our position there right now.\nTerry Tillman: That\u2019s great to hear. And then Brian we\u2019ve gotten a lot of data points on payments, and there\u2019s lots of puts and takes up particularly the gross to net or when there\u2019s a rev share, but could you just like really try to help boil it down in terms of for \u201823, the payments revenue business? I mean would that grow at about a similar rate in \u201822, or just anything you can share about the growth rate on the recognized revenue for payments? Thank you. \nBrian Miller: Yes, I think the growth rate on payments is going to be above Tyler\u2019s overall growth rate is going to be a positive contributor. And I expect that, in general, that will be accelerating from 2022 both from adding new customers through the cross sell motion, which we talked about, we\u2019ve integrated our payments teams. We\u2019ve really got the go to market strategy down and now we\u2019re starting to execute on it. Whether it\u2019s using the expanded capabilities around that NICs platform brought us to drive that business down into the local level, continuing to have a focus on penetrating more of our customer base with payments, either with our product form or partner platforms, driving more adoption into the customer base. And then the addition of rapid so giving us capabilities on the disbursement side. And we\u2019ve got some really interesting opportunities around that and think that\u2019s going to be a nice growth driver. So I\u2019d say we generally expect the payments business to grow faster than sort of Tyler\u2019s top line revenues at least in 2023. \nLynn Moore: As we have our inside sales focusing on that existing customer base. When you look at areas like our enterprise side, whether it\u2019s enterprise ERP we\u2019re including payments in all new responses, all new deal responses, that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re out there getting an every new deal, but we are pushing payments in all of our new deals.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Reilly with Needham, Your line is now open. \nJoshua Reilly: Thanks, guys for squeezing me in. I\u2019ll just ask one question here since we\u2019re running over time. The software development costs were only 2 million in the quarter, which is obviously below what we were expecting. Can you just discuss the impact of the accounting changes to this figure? And how guidance of 37 million for 2023 is the proper amount implying an increase given the accounting changes that we have here?\nBrian Miller: Yes, the guidance for 2023 of $37 million in capitalized software development encompasses how we expect those projects to be accounted for. So that\u2019s reflect, the impact of that change is reflected there as well as other capitalized development projects that are either starting or ramping up during the year. So that\u2019s fully encompassed there. But the change in expensing versus capitalizing for the full year of 2022 had about a $9 million impact versus what our initial guidance for capitalized software and R&D was.\nJoshua Reilly: And was that just reflected in that Q4 number, then the full $9 million impact? Or how was that only 2 million, I guess in the quarter? \nBrian Miller: Well, it impacted the full year, but most of that impact was seen in the Q4 results. So that resulted in a much lower number in Q4 versus the rest of the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David [Indiscernible] with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. \nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks very much for squeezing me and I appreciate it. Just one for me. Brian, I heard your comments in the prepared remarks. You\u2019re touching on growing implementations team or 2023 to meet backlog. Can you just talk about the labor market trends you\u2019re seeing and where you stand currently in terms of hires? What we\u2019re seeing in terms of wage inflation, etc? Thank you. \nA \u2013 Brian Miller: Yes, there continues to be challenges in the labor market but it\u2019s definitely mitigating from what we saw last year. Obviously, it\u2019s been very common across multiple industries, but certainly in technology where you\u2019re seeing layoffs, hiring freezes, and so there\u2019s less pressure. I think, on us in terms of turnover which is moderating, and there\u2019s less pressure than we saw last year on wage increases. So each of those are working in a positive manner for us.\nLynn Moore: Yes, I\u2019d say, David if you go back 12 months ago, we were still experiencing really pretty high elevated turnover, still lower than industry, but higher than our norms, which, as you know, was all companies we\u2019re dealing with. As we progress throughout the year, things started, I think there\u2019s I talk a lot about the pendulum and the labor market pendulum is another one that I talked about. And it\u2019s definitely started to swing back as we fell back into sort of November, December, I would say our turnover has actually come back down to sort of pre-COVID levels. Still early to see if that\u2019s where it stays. But I like words, it\u2019s I like that trend. As it relates to things like that Brian mentioned our services and implementation. That was an area that was hit particularly hard over the last couple years, and we\u2019ve won a lot of business. We do have to do some hiring to ramp up to deliver on that business. And we\u2019re doing that. It\u2019s also creates a little bit of margin pressure in the near term. Because when we hire large classes of implementers, it normally takes four or five, six months before we get them out billable on the road.\nBrian Miller: Most of the growth in our headcount this year will be in revenue generating positions. \nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. \nKeith Housum: morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in here. I\u2019m just unpacking the payments just a little bit further. The 571 wins is obviously a phenomenal number for the year. Are these mostly agencies that are we taking on that payments for the first time, or at least actually competitive with and what do you see the trajectory I guess in 2023 for that same question? \nBrian Miller: I\u2019d say the majority of that number, although not the majority of the dollars, but the majority of the number would be certainly new payments for most of this customer. So a lot of those are existing Tyler customers where we\u2019re adding payments to a utility billing system or a licensing and permitting system. So we may be adding capabilities. they may have only taken checks before and now we\u2019re providing online payment capabilities or credit card payments. And a number of those are still under rev share agreements. So the revenue generated is on an individual payment opportunity may be relatively small, but at good margins. But some of the more significant wins are competitive wins, like we mentioned the City of Milwaukee. That\u2019s a full enterprise payment processing contract. And we\u2019re replacing another vendor there. So I\u2019d say the larger wins tend to be competitive ones, the smaller ones tend to be more first time payments. \nOperator: This concludes our question and answer session for today. I turn the call back over to you Lynn Moore. \nLynn Moore : Great. Thanks, everybody for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Have a great day everybody.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian Miller",
            "content": "Thank you, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2022. Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $452.2 million, up 4.3% and 4.2%, respectively. Organic revenue growth, excluding COVID-related revenues, with 6% on a GAAP basis and 5.8% on a non-GAAP basis. COVID-related revenues for the quarter were $3.5 million compared to $16.6 million in last year's fourth quarter. Revenues from all of our COVID-related initiatives have now officially ended. Licensed revenue declined over 60% as our new software contract mix continued to shift to SaaS at an accelerated pace. Professional services revenue rose 2.8% and 8.5% organically. And we intend to continue to grow our implementation teams in 2023 to support delivery of our growing backlog and pipeline that will likely continue to see some pressure on professional services revenue in the near-term as the teams ramp up to become fully billable. Subscriptions revenues increased 11.9% and organically rose 14.3%. We added 140 new SaaS arrangements and converted 82 existing on-premises clients to SaaS, with a total contract value of approximately $99 million. In Q4 of last year, we added 135 new SaaS arrangements and had 71 on-premises conversions, with the total contract value of approximately $74 million. Our software subscription bookings in the fourth quarter added $21.4 million in new ARR. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 86% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter, compared to 77% in Q4 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this year, this quarter was 3.9 years consistent with last year. Transaction-based revenues, which includes state enterprise portal, payment processing and E-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $146.5 million, up 6.9%. E-filing revenue reached a new high of $19.8 million, up 12.7%. Our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $150 billion - I'm sorry, $1.50 billion, up 7.5%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was $440.6 million, up 18.5%. Transaction-based ARR was $586.2 million, up to 6.9% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was slightly down at $469.1 million due to the continued shift of new clients and migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. Operating margins in the quarter were pressured by the acceleration of the shift to the cloud in new business and the related decline in license revenues as well as by an increase in R&D expense as certain development costs that we had expected to capitalize were expensed. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was a new high of $1.89 billion, up 5.2%. Bookings in the quarter were approximately $464 million, which was flat with last year. On an organic basis bookings were approximately 354 million up 2%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately 1.9 billion, up 9.5% and on our organic basis were approximately 1.4 billion up 1.6%. Capital expenditures for the year totaled $50.1 million below our Q3 guidance of $58 million to $62 million, primarily because of the reduction and capitalized software development that drove higher R&D expense. Cash flows from operations were 121.9 million up 6% and free cash flow was 114.7 million up 20.6%; both represented a new high for the fourth quarter.  We continue to strengthen our already solid balance sheet throughout 2022. During the fourth quarter, we repaid $90 million of our term debt and since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $755 million of debt. We ended the year with outstanding debt of 995 million and cash and investments of approximately 229 million. As a reminder $600 million of our debt is in the form of convertible debt with a fixed interest rate of a quarter of a percent. The remaining $395 million in pre-payable term debt due in 2024 and 2026 with interest in flooding rates based on LIBOR plus a margin of 125 or 150 basis points. Thus our exposure to floating rates is limited. Beginning in February 2023 SOFR has replaced LIBOR as our reference rate. We also have an undrawn $500 million revolver. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 1.64 times trailing 12 months pro EBITDA. We've also issued our initial guidance for 2023. Please keep in mind that our outlook for 2023 includes no COVID related revenues as those initiatives were completed in the fourth quarter. For the year 2022 COVID related revenues totaled $51 million with $10.8 million in subscriptions, and 40.2 million in professional services. In addition, another revenue headwind that is factored into our guidance is the shift of two of our digital solutions state enterprise agreements from the gross to the net model for payments resulting in a 10.5% million reduction in revenues, although with a positive impact on margins. Our 2023 guidance is as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.935 billion and $1.970 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8%. To add more color to our revenue expectations, we expect growth by revenue line to be in the following approximate ranges. Subscription revenues will grow in the mid teens. Professional services revenues will decline in the high single digits but excluding COVID revenues will grow in the high single digits. License and royalty revenues will decline approximately 30% or more. Maintenance will decline in the low single digits. Appraisal services will grow in the high single digits and hardware and other revenue will be relatively flat. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $4.10 and $4.25 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option activity on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.50 and $7.65. Well, we don't give quarterly guidance, we do expect first quarter EPS to be in the range of Q4, 2022 EPS with a significant sequential increase in Q2. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $26 million including approximately $5 million of non-cash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. And finally, while we don't give specifically guidance on free cash flow, we want to point out a change in taxes that we expect will have a significant impact on our cash taxes and therefore our free cash flow. The tax cut and jobs act required that starting in 2022 research and experimentation expenditures known as Section 174 costs are required to be capitalized and amortized over either five years for expenditures in the U.S. or 15 years for those incurred outside the U.S. for tax purposes. Since the enactment of the TCJA businesses, including us have been monitoring congressional actions around this rule, and there was a strong expectation that section 174 would be repealed or delayed. However, Congress has not yet taken action. While the section 174 change has a slight favorable impact on our tax rate it significantly accelerates the timing and amount of our cash tax payments. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn. Yes. I think it's still a little early for us to give much color around sort of how we see that trajectory playing out in 2024 and over the midterms over the next five to seven years. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect to have an Investor Day around mid-year and provide more detail on that, but we're still refining those models. So not really able to give a lot of color around that. As we've talked about some of the factors that give us confidence that we do return to margin expansion in 2024, particularly around the wind down of some of the bubble costs as we exit our first data center. We think that this year, actually, we sort of reached that inflection point where the impact of declines in licenses are offset by the current stream of recurring revenues from subscriptions. I think in terms of the factors that could make that go faster or slower certainly one of those is the speed at which our payments business grows. And Lynn talked a little bit about the impact that has on our blended margins. But on the software side, I think that the trajectory around the speed of the flips from our on-premise customers will have an impact on that. Some of the other efficiency gains and product optimizations as we wrap those up the ability to improve lower hosting costs, I think the speed at which those work their way into the model will also be a factor in how that trajectory, how fast that trajectory plays out. Yes, I'd say probably the two biggest factors, there were one that licenses declined pretty significantly. And we've talked about that expectation, kind of going into 2023 but Q4 had a bit of a deeper decline from the mix of new business. So licenses were relatively low number. And, again, most of that is a shift in the mix as opposed to less new business. We did as we typically have with our more license heavy products and public safety and platform technologies some slippage out of the quarter in terms of timing, but that's pretty typical. So I'd say that the lower licenses were the big factor. And then probably the other factor is the higher R&D expense that we mentioned were some expenses that we had expected to be capitalized were actually expense because of the nature of the development efforts. And so that impacted our margins as well. Yes. So yes, for the full year, the difference in the capitalize versus expensed R&D versus our expectation was close to $9 million. We gave guidance for R&D for next year, in the range of $108 million to $110 million that's expensed and our capitalized R&D in 2023 is expected to be in the high 30s, say around $37 million. So capitalization is a little bit higher, but R&D expense is higher in 2023. If you look at the sort of the midpoint of our guidance, it implies I'd say somewhere between 60 and 100 basis points of operating margin compression in total and we mentioned that the bubble costs are estimated to be about 130 basis points of impact on 2023 margins. New bubble costs. So and that's higher than the impact was in 2022. We talked about those as being a little less than 100 basis points of impact and that's to be expected, because we continue to move more customers into the public cloud and while we still operating our two data centers and so the duplicate costs expand this year, and we've talked about an expectation in the first half of 2024 that will be out of the first data centers and that'll start to mitigate. Yes, I think one of the bigger factors around backlog I think backlog is probably becomes maybe a little less meaningful or less of a full picture when you look at it is really around how the accounting drives what goes into backlog and what doesn't. So transaction revenues don't sit in the backlog. So as we add new payments or new portal revenues, those typically are under fixed arrangements so even though they may be highly predictable and recurring. So there typically wouldn't be an addition to backlog for those.  And then we've talked in the past as well about sometimes the terms of a contract agreement dictate how much goes into backlog. So for example, a termination for convenience provision can significantly limit that we saw that with a really large contract last quarter. That was a 50 plus million dollar contract that only $8 million went into backlog because that's a termination for convenience provision. So I think there's a lot of factors that start to make the backlog number maybe less of an important metric to look at how we expect to perform going forward. Yes, and this quarter, we did not have any individual contracts that were more than $5 million in total contract values. We had a couple in the $4 million range on the software side. We did have a competitive rebid when, with our state enterprise agreement in Colorado, which is one of our bigger states. And certainly the total value of that contract over the five year term is well above $5 million. But on the software side, no individual deals more than 5 million. So it was more of a high volume sort of more mid range deals this quarter. Yes, and actually on the payment deal, that there really wouldn't be anything that in the bookings number, only the actual revenues as they come through in a given quarter basically run through bookings and revenue at the same time. So for payments, we don't include it again, because they're not a fixed amount. We don't include those in bookings or in backlog. But those payments deals for the full year we estimate that they'll add more than $13 million in annual recurring revenues. And there's a mixture of contracts there that are either gross or net processing through our platform and still some deals that are through our reseller arrangements where we have a revenue sharing arrangement. So the revenues are lower but the margins are higher on those. Well. We expect, clearly we expect the subscription booking and subscription ARR will accelerate from 2022 and 2023, both on the transaction side and the SaaS software side. Part of that, again, the change in the mix accelerating in a more significant decline in licenses this year with that being replaced by new subscription arrangements. I think the question about just the new subscription ARR again, that number really just relates to new software deals. And as you said, there weren't any mega deals in this quarter. But a good volume of sort of midsized deals. I think more that's just around the timing. We've said that the pipeline continues to be very strong. RFP activity remains generally stable at pretty elevated levels of the market activity supports that expectation that we'll continue to see an accelerating rate of new software ARR. Yes, I think, generally, we would expect that and we talked about what are our capitalization, our CapEx, both software and non-software CapEx is for 2023. That's a bit higher. And some of that's related to software CapEx and some of that's related to facilities investments that we're making in a couple of particular locations as expected in \u201824, that that CapEx would decline. In general, I think our cash flow margin would grow in line with a faster than our operating margin. Once that CapEx starts to normalize. The impact of the Section 174, which is still a bit unclear, will be significant on cash flow in 2023. Because if it stands, if it's not repealed, and we're not the first company or the first software company to talk about this, you're starting to see more of it. I know Microsoft talked about a more than billion dollar impact on their taxes. But if it stands and isn't repealed or delayed, that our cash tax payments will be significantly higher this year because we'll have the impact of both sort of catching up the 2022 taxes under that assumption and making cash tax payments related to 2023. So it could be in the 100 million dollar range of additional cash taxes this year, which would really, as I said, the two years impact, roughly $50 million related to 2022 and 50, related to 2023 in round numbers. So we'll see how that plays out. But that's sort of the current expectation. And given the way that tax change works, it will impact cash taxes for five years until it normalizes and you're putting on the same amount that you're amortizing. I think that's fair. Gabri, I don't. Right now, procurement cycles are pretty normal. They're going in line with our clients budgets are healthy. And we're not really seeing delayed procurement cycles right now. Again, from our perspective, the market is relatively healthy, their budgets are healthy, and our competitive position remains strong. So we're seeing a pretty normal, really above normal market. I'll take, I'll start on that and Lynn can add to that. We do think that in our space, that the shift to the cloud and our cloud strategy gives us a competitive advantage. As you know, we compete across products with different competitors, and generally in each of our products suite. And those range from some very large companies to a lot of smaller, more niche e-companies. And we think that where we are in the cloud transition, is well in advance of where a lot of our competitors are. And as that desire, on our client base to move to the cloud accelerates that gives us an advantage and an ability to increase our share because of where we are in our cloud transition. And then, as we've talked about in the past, our connected communities vision, and the fact that we have this broad suite of products that work increasingly well together, continues to provide us with a competitive advantage there in clients that are looking for a sweet solution. And we think that this could be one of our strengths. I don't know that. I have a lot to add to that. It clearly is the vast majority. We did mention that a couple of our date enterprise agreements that digital solutions are shifting in 2023 to net from gross and that's got about a $2.5 million impact. But as Lynn said, we don't really fully control that. And so I would expect that still going forward, the majority of the business comes to us through the gross model where we're paying the merchant fees which is why we wanted to sort of give you the apples to apples comparison of the margin impact of a couple of 100 basis points, if all of those net ones were on the gross model, and you took the merchant fees out of the revenue side. So I would say that as more Tyler customers that have traditionally been on a sort of a reseller with third party payment processors, where we get a revenue share, which is a net accounting, as more of those overtime migrate to our proprietary platform, we could have a shift with from those customers that are currently on a net basis moving to a gross basis with Tyler. The net result is we keep more of the transaction. So we make more money. We'd have higher revenues, but it would have a negative impact on margins. And we'll attempt at our investor day to provide more color on how those work and how we see that playing out. Because clearly significant growth in the payments business is an objective of ours and something that we're having a lot of success with and expect to continue to. Yes, I think it was generally in line with our expectation. I don't know that it was significantly varied from plan. I guess one other factor that plays into that is the lag between when we sign a SaaS deal and when we start to recognize revenues. And that can vary, but it can be typically the implementations are quicker or the time from signing to starting to recognize revenues is quicker on a SaaS deal than on an on-prem deal. But that can vary and that can typically be, say six months that can be longer. And so I think when I talk about timing, it's more around the difference between when we signed something and when we're starting to recognize revenues. Yes, Jonathan, I mean, cross selling is one of our major mid to long term growth drivers. It's something we're talking about internally, as you look out over the next seven, eight years to about Tyler 2030. And things that can, quote, really move the needle. It's these things like flips, its payments, it's cross selling, it's also a lot of other things that we do really well. And we've talked about areas of our business like supervision, where the where the market is good, where the TAM is good, and where we're making really big gains there. But cross selling is something that we're prioritizing across all of Tyler, where we've actually started some new sort of strategic account management approach within NIC and bringing other resources, getting even further exposure to our sales channels, our sales leads. There are things that we will be working on in terms of internally around how we recognize revenue from cross sells, and how we incentivize things and structurally internally, things that we need to sort of clear out some of those barriers to sort of unleash that power even more. We're pretty excited about it. I mean we had probably this past quarter, probably one of the best stories we've had in a long time in terms of both cross selling and sort of connected communities which was the Kansas Department of Revenue story that I mentioned in my opening remarks. This was a deal where this deal took place because of our DNI solution around assessments, and the fact that we had such a broad footprint and presence within the state of Kansas from our enterprise assessment. But it also didn't happen without NIC and their contacts at the state and utilizing that state master contract. So that was three different pieces of our organization coming together to create a really great result and something that I think we can replicate across other states that deals a $600,000, AAR deal, really an ideal, but really took the efforts of multiple divisions to do that. And I think that's sort of an example of what we're looking to do in the future. Yes, I think so. We certainly expect a bigger decline in licensed revenues this year. Licenses are always the most, or the least predictable of our revenue streams at least in the short term. And so now with well into the 80s, is the percentage of our revenues that are recurring. There's much less, a much higher level of predictability. So I think we're definitely kind of around that corner. And in that there should be an increasingly higher level of confidence around our outlooks versus what we actually where results come in. Yes, I think the growth rate on payments is going to be above Tyler's overall growth rate is going to be a positive contributor. And I expect that, in general, that will be accelerating from 2022 both from adding new customers through the cross sell motion, which we talked about, we've integrated our payments teams. We've really got the go to market strategy down and now we're starting to execute on it. Whether it's using the expanded capabilities around that NICs platform brought us to drive that business down into the local level, continuing to have a focus on penetrating more of our customer base with payments, either with our product form or partner platforms, driving more adoption into the customer base. And then the addition of rapid so giving us capabilities on the disbursement side. And we've got some really interesting opportunities around that and think that's going to be a nice growth driver. So I'd say we generally expect the payments business to grow faster than sort of Tyler's top line revenues at least in 2023. Yes, the guidance for 2023 of $37 million in capitalized software development encompasses how we expect those projects to be accounted for. So that's reflect, the impact of that change is reflected there as well as other capitalized development projects that are either starting or ramping up during the year. So that's fully encompassed there. But the change in expensing versus capitalizing for the full year of 2022 had about a $9 million impact versus what our initial guidance for capitalized software and R&D was. Well, it impacted the full year, but most of that impact was seen in the Q4 results. So that resulted in a much lower number in Q4 versus the rest of the year. Most of the growth in our headcount this year will be in revenue generating positions. I'd say the majority of that number, although not the majority of the dollars, but the majority of the number would be certainly new payments for most of this customer. So a lot of those are existing Tyler customers where we're adding payments to a utility billing system or a licensing and permitting system. So we may be adding capabilities. they may have only taken checks before and now we're providing online payment capabilities or credit card payments. And a number of those are still under rev share agreements. So the revenue generated is on an individual payment opportunity may be relatively small, but at good margins. But some of the more significant wins are competitive wins, like we mentioned the City of Milwaukee. That's a full enterprise payment processing contract. And we're replacing another vendor there. So I'd say the larger wins tend to be competitive ones, the smaller ones tend to be more first time payments."

            "content": "Thanks,s Hala. Our fourth quarter results marked a solid finish to an eventful year as public sector demand remained strong and SaaS adaption continues at an accelerated pace. Total revenues grew 4.3%, with organic growth excluding COVID related revenues of approximately 6% and organic revenue growth for full year was solid at approximately 8.2%. Recurring revenues comprised nearly 83% of our quarterly revenues. On an organic basis, subscription revenue grew 14.3%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth and transaction-based revenues. Most importantly, SaaS revenues included in subscriptions grew 19.3%. We achieved solid revenue growth even as the shift in new software contract mix continue to accelerate to SaaS from licenses. In Q4, 86%, of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 77% in Q4 last year. In our digital solutions division, which is formerly known as NIC, we continue to execute on cross-selling opportunities. And in Q4, we signed a significant new contract with the Kansas Department of Revenue to provide our Data and Insights Assessment Connect Solution, which will work with our Enterprise Assessment solution used statewide in Kansas. We also signed sell-through deals for our recreation dynamic solution with Utah division of outdoor recreation and the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and parks. Our Digital Solutions division also signed notable SaaS software agreements with the state of Nevada and the Alabama Alcohol Beverage Control Board. We also signed a payments processing contract with the Wisconsin Department of Motor Vehicles, which is our first payments opportunity in Wisconsin. Finally, our Digital Solutions division won a competitive rebid for our master enterprise contract with the state of Colorado's Statewide Internet Portal Authority Board, as well as an extension of our master enterprise contract with the state of Oklahoma. In other Tyler divisions, we signed seven additional significant SaaS deals, each for different product suites and each with a total contract value greater than $2 million. Those include contracts with the Cypress Fairbanks Independent School District in Texas for our student transportation solution; the cities of Prosper Texas and Glendora, California for our enterprise ERP and enterprise permitting and licensing solutions; the Placer County Water Agency in California, and the City of Helena, Montana for our enterprise ERP solution; the City of Albuquerque, New Mexico for enterprise permitting licensing solution; and Lucas County, Ohio for our enterprise justice solution. In addition to those deals, we signed 12 SaaS deals in the quarter, with contract values between $1 million and $2 million each. In the fourth quarter, we signed 153 new payments deals worth more than $4.7 million in estimated annual recurring revenue across Tyler divisions, other than digital solutions. The largest of those was an agreement to provide payment processing for the City of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, was estimated annual revenues of more than $1.2 million. For the full year 2022, we signed 571 new payments deals, with more than $13 million in annual recurring revenue, many of which we were able to pursue because of the new capabilities that came to us with NIC. More than 80% of those were sold to existing Tyler software clients. New payments only agreements typically have a lag of three to six months between signing and revenue generation. While payments agreements that are embedded in a broader solution, such as new ERP sale, may have a period of 6 to 18 months from signing to revenue generation.  In our justice group, we signed two notable multi suite license deals in the quarter for enterprise public safety, enforcement mobile and data insight solutions with Stearns County, Minnesota and Richland County, Ohio. We also signed two significant license contracts for our Enterprise Justice Solution with Midland County, Texas and Kankakee County, Illinois, which also include our Enterprise Solution - Supervision solution. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for \u201823. Thanks, Brian. During 2022, we achieved notable milestones towards several key strategic initiatives. We made meaningful progress on our cloud journey through continued investment in cloud optimization, and moving to cloud only deployment for many of our core solutions. Our intentional innovation is based on knowing our clients and anticipating their future knees. As you recall, in 2019, we launched a strategic shift from a cloud agnostic model to a cloud first model to deliver secure, scalable, dependable and compliant digital infrastructure. We're pleased to see the accelerated pace of cloud adoption amongst our new clients, as well as the steady increasing pace of cloud migrations of on-premises clients. Additionally, we integrated our Tyler and NIC payments teams and launched a significant go to market strategy for payments with a growing and active pipeline. During the year, we added 571 new payments clients with the vast majority at the local level. We leveraged our strong relationships across state and local agencies, including the NIC state enterprise contracts, to expand our cross sell opportunities with significant multi solution deals that demonstrate the power of our One Tyler approach. We're still in the early stages of cross sell, and it's exciting to see tremendous momentum and collaboration taking place. Since completing the acquisition of NIC synergies between NIC and Tyler have delivered 19 cross sell transactions worth $9.5 million in total contract value.  Overall, the year was highlighted by significant wins highly successful upsell efforts and state renewals and expansions. Throughout the year, we also demonstrate a balanced yet opportunistic approach across our business and with respect to capital allocation. We maintain a strategic lens toward acquisitions and close three transactions that bring innovative and robust offerings to elevate our digital solutions payments business, broaden our integrated solutions, and add new technology. All three acquisitions Quadrate, USC Direct and Rapid Financial Solutions support a unified client experience and further our connected communities vision to support thriving communities through a common digital foundation for better data access, engagement, and transparency. As we move into 2023, I've never been more confident about Tyler's long term prospects. This is an important year in our cloud transition. And we are tracking well with our cloud optimization product development efforts and the plan to exit from our proprietary data centers in 2024 and 2025. We expect to reach an inflection point in our cloud transition in 2023 with a significant decline in licensed revenues that are being replaced by valuable long term recurring SaaS revenue. As a result of the short term revenue headwinds from this mix shift, together with bubble costs related to SaaS transition, including duplicate costs of operating our proprietary data centers, while moving our hosting to AWS operating margins are expected to trough this year. The estimated impact of bubble costs on our 2023 non-GAAP operating margin is approximately 130 basis points. We are committed to returning to a trajectory of consistent operating margin expansion beginning in 2024. In fact, you'll see in our upcoming proxy statement that we have added operating margin expansion as a second metric for our long term incentive plans for our senior leadership.  Our move to cloud first builds long term value and supports multiple long term growth drivers. In the midterm over the next five to seven years, we've talked about annual organic revenue growth in the 8% to 10% range, with consistent long term margin expansion of at least 50 to 100 basis points a year beginning in 2024 excluding the impact of merchant PCs from payments expansion. We continue to refine our Tyler 2030 plan and look forward to sharing our longer term vision and clearly defined targets for revenue, margin and payments growth during an investor day planned for mid year. Look for more details on that soon. When we look at our operating margins, it's also important to consider the impact that growth in our payments business has on margins. We recognize revenues for payment processing under multiple revenue models. A gross model for agreements, where we are responsible for merchant fees on the transactions, a net model where a client assumes direct responsibility for merchant fees, and a revenue sharing model similar to the net model where we are effectively reselling a third party processor services. The majority of NIC's payment processing is under the gross model. And in 2022, we paid a total merchant fees of approximately $145 million with a small margin earned on those fees. If those same contracts were on a net basis, our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin would have been approximately 200 basis points higher. Our operational and financial discipline coupled with a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity allow us to aggressively manage our debt profile and moderate the impact of rising interest rates. And delevering continues to be a priority for capital allocation. While the bar is high for acquisitions, we continue to have the flexibility to evaluate M&A prospects that present compelling strategic growth opportunities. To close I'm proud of our team Tyler team and what we continue to accomplish every day even amid macro economic uncertainty. As you've seen in our press releases, we received many industry and regional accolades, which is a testament to our work ethic, our culture, and our tireless efforts to support our clients' needs. We also receive gratifying recognition for our environmental, social and governance practices, being named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the second consecutive year. The DJSI cited are notable gains in IT security, risk analysis, privacy protection, and human capital development. In addition, we were recently named to Newsweek's list of America's greatest workplaces for diversity. We're proud of these recognitions, and remain committed to sustainable business practices. With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A. Yes, I think just to amplify on that we've talked over the last couple of years we're about three or four years or so into this cloud transition. And we've talked about sort of the two pieces of it, the getting dealer side on the revenue side, and then sort of getting the other side on the cost and expense side. And as Brian mentioned, on the revenue side, we're seeing that sort of inflection point it's going to take place, probably later this year. And last couple of years, the last licenses has been a significant impact. And our internal models are now showing that really the new flips, the gains from flip as well as the SaaS business over the last couple of years, is going to later this year, sort of past that point of where we lost licenses. Remember, back in 2019, we did just over $100 million in licenses. So it's a significant change that we've been running through the financials. And then when you look on the cost side each years go by, as these, as time goes by, we're getting better and better visibility where we are making progress on optimizing our products. We're making more progress on our plans to exit our proprietary data centers. We're getting better data on how our products are actually operating within the public cloud. And so a lot of that stuff gives us that confidence that 2023 is that margin trough. As we look out farther there's other things that we're doing as well. We have a lot of internal initiatives around efficiencies, things like consolidating just some of our internal IT. We have other sort of satellite data centers that we're looking to collapse, as well as things like looking at real estate and stuff like that. So there's a lot of initiatives around that, which I think give us that confidence when we talk about \u201823 being sort of the margin trough. I think the answer is probably similar to what we've said in the past. I would say, as I look at our clients budgets, they're generally very healthy. As I've mentioned, before, they were not as impacted by COVID, as people thought. They are having access to federal funds. Some of it, Brian, the timetables of one that they still have a couple of years, I think it's been there. So we're just generally seeing healthy budgets, healthy buying seasons, sort of just a really good, robust market. In terms of identifying specific deals there are occasions for that. But I think really, what it does is it's more about just overall confidence in our clients being willing to spend money. Yes. Sure. Robin. I think you're right. I flipped actually, I think there are quite a bit year-over-year. I think this year, we did about 336 flips. Last year, we did about 239 flips give or take. So roughly 40%. I see flips being a significant driver of revenue growth over the next five to seven years. I see them continuing to grow at a healthy pace. And I don't really, I'm not in a position to tell you that we're going to grow North of 15%, 20% each year, but we have a wide and deep customer base, that has become a priority, and we're prioritizing our flips internally. Yes. Sure Pete. On the public safety side, it is typically a little bit larger quarter. we don't typically talk about deals that we've awarded, but not signed. I will say that we had a couple of deals that were of significance that that pushed for the quarter. We are continuing to see more and more acceptance on the public safety side to the SaaS model and to subscriptions. And I think we're going to continue to see that going forward. It's part of our actual in our budget process. If you look generally across Tyler, I think for next year on a sort of an overall weighted value average, we're expecting north of 90%, 91% of deals next year to be in SaaS with a significant increase on the public safety side, still less than half on the public safety side. But it is something that we're doing some modeling and some things that we're trying to do to sort of push that model with our clients. Yes, I'll start and varnish probably got better numbers. NIC which in our digital solutions division, I would say the overwhelming majority of their payments business was on a gross basis. I would say on the Tyler side beforehand, more of it's been on the net basis. That's actually not a lever that we fully control. It's generally controlled by the customer and whether or not the customer is wants to take the risk and on the interchange fees or if not, there's a number of factors that go into there. But as of right now, a substantial part of Tyler's overall business is on the gross model because of NIC and more NIC was how mature and vast that business was. We've got the number for merchant fees that we passed through last year was about I think, on the NIC side was about $142 million. And maybe just a handful of $3 million, $4 million, $5 million on the Tyler side. And looking at it next year I think NIC side is probably more around 145-ish million again with the same few million more on top from Tyler. I'd say there's two things around timing one is, just as Brian mentioned, yes in the old days, when you sign an on-prem license, you recognize the entire license upfront. On a SaaS deal, particularly when we're doing multi suite, multi module deals, they're generally going to start paying those when those particular modules or pieces go live. So you've got to delay from the time you sign to where you get first parts of the customer up live. But as you continue that implementation and other pieces go live, then you will get that build up. I say the other side is when you look at flips there's things around flips that while long term, obviously provide really great long term value and the short term sometimes we're providing some services, perhaps that discount or no charge. There also might be some concessions depending on how long the customer has had their license and where they sit. And so to sort of incentivize the flip, there's sometimes some sort of upfront concession, which can then create another lag factor before you get the full value of that flip. Yes, my expectation is that at least one of those larger deals is on track to close in Q1. As it relates to Tyler federal. I think you're right. I mean, things that I'm seeing that's coming out of that that division, in terms of sales indicators, the pipeline, the volume of deals is up significantly since year-over-year. We're also seeing interesting going up more and more movement in the federal side to SaaS, which is good to see. It's something that we put an internal focus on in the last two years. And we're starting to see more of that receptiveness there. So I think there's positive things coming out of the federal space. And I like our position there right now. As we have our inside sales focusing on that existing customer base. When you look at areas like our enterprise side, whether it's enterprise ERP we're including payments in all new responses, all new deal responses, that doesn't mean they're out there getting an every new deal, but we are pushing payments in all of our new deals. Yes, I'd say, David if you go back 12 months ago, we were still experiencing really pretty high elevated turnover, still lower than industry, but higher than our norms, which, as you know, was all companies we're dealing with. As we progress throughout the year, things started, I think there's I talk a lot about the pendulum and the labor market pendulum is another one that I talked about. And it's definitely started to swing back as we fell back into sort of November, December, I would say our turnover has actually come back down to sort of pre-COVID levels. Still early to see if that's where it stays. But I like words, it's I like that trend. As it relates to things like that Brian mentioned our services and implementation. That was an area that was hit particularly hard over the last couple years, and we've won a lot of business. We do have to do some hiring to ramp up to deliver on that business. And we're doing that. It's also creates a little bit of margin pressure in the near term. Because when we hire large classes of implementers, it normally takes four or five, six months before we get them out billable on the road. Great. Thanks, everybody for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Have a great day everybody."

Our third quarter results were highlighted by strong execution that drove solid organic revenue growth and higher earnings while also advancing our cloud-first strategy. Total revenues grew approximately 3% with organic growth, excluding COVID-related revenues of approximately 9%. Recurring revenues comprised 78.5% of our quarterly revenues. On an organic basis, excluding COVID-related revenues, subscription revenue grew 14.5%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth in transaction-based revenues. We achieved solid revenue growth even as the shift in new software contracts mix continue to accelerate to SaaS from licenses. In Q3, 91% of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 74% in Q3 last year. Our largest new software contract for the quarter was with the US Department of State for our case management development platform, formerly known as entellitrak. This five-year SaaS arrangement is valued at over $54 million and includes over $5 million of ARR in the first year, ramping to over $8.5 million of ARR in the fifth year. However, due to certain contract terms, only approximately $8 million of the value of this contract is included in backlog and bookings for the third quarter. The second largest deal of the quarter was a five-year SaaS deal for our enterprise supervision solution with the Arizona Office of the Courts valued at over $15 million. This arrangement includes two five-year optional renewals and with add-on components has the potential to grow to more than $82 million over 15 years. We also signed a notable statewide SaaS deal for our enterprise supervision solution with the State of Oregon Judicial Department valued at approximately $3.5 million. These contracts are great examples of our ability to make a strategic tuck-in acquisition and grow the acquired products by leveraging our client base and sales channel. When we acquired CaseloadPRO, which is now our Enterprise Supervision Product four years ago, its annual revenues were approximately $2.7 million. This quarter alone, our new sales of Enterprise Supervision added almost $4 million of ARR. In other Tyler divisions, we signed five additional significant SaaS deals each for different product suites and each with a total contract value greater than $2 million. Those include Pierce County, Washington for our Enterprise Assessment and Tax solution, the City of Abilene, Texas, the Resin Unified School District in Wisconsin, and Alachua County, Florida for our Enterprise ERP solution, the Toronto Region Conservation Authority in Ontario for Enterprise Permitting and Licensing Solution. In addition, we signed 12 SaaS deals in the quarter with contract values between $1 million and $2 million each. We also signed three notable license deals in the quarter for Enterprise Public Safety, Enforcement Mobile and Data & Insight solutions. With Hidalgo County, Texas, which was funded by ARPA, the combined Regional Communications Authority in Colorado and the city of Melbourne, Florida. Also during the third quarter, we successfully renewed our NIC enterprise contract in Alabama and won a competitive rebid for our enterprise contract in Maine. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in October, we renewed our NIC enterprise contract in Oklahoma, and our contract in Pennsylvania is expected to expire in the fourth quarter. We also converted our State of Iowa data and insights agreement from a third-party reseller to the NIC master contract. In addition, NIC signed a new four-year SaaS agreement for our medical cannabis regulation solution with the Arkansas Department of Health, Medical cannabis licensing with ARR of approximately $450,000. Before I turn the call over to Brian, I'd like to comment on the Rapid Financial Solutions acquisition we announced this morning. We're extremely excited to partner with the innovative team at Rapid, who will join our payments group. Rapid is a leader in the payment solutions market with 20 years' experience and expands our capabilities with best-in-class digital disbursements. We will now be able to offer our public sector clients a reliable, scalable, and secure platform for disbursing payments. Rapid has more than 1,500 customers concentrated in courts and correction facilities which includes managing disbursements for VendEngine, which we acquired in September of last year. Combined with our approximately 7,200 clients in the payment space, we believe this is a significant opportunity to leverage the full suite of market-leading payment solutions to make customer interactions stronger and more secure. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results of the quarter, and our annual guidance for 2022.\nBrian Miller: Thanks Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30th, 2022. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We have also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financials tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $473.2 million, up 2.9% and 2.7%, respectively. Organic revenue growth, excluding COVID-related revenues was strong at 9% on a GAAP basis and 8.8% on a non-GAAP basis. NIC's COVID-related revenues for the quarter were $11.7 million compared to $43.3 million in last year's third quarter. Revenue from the TourHealth initiative ended in the second quarter and the Virginia Rent Relief program has now officially ended with less than $2 million of remaining revenues anticipated in the fourth quarter. License revenue declined 10.6% as our new software contract mix has shifted to SaaS even more rapidly than planned at the beginning of the year. Professional services revenues rose 15.7% and 6.3% organically. We intend to continue to grow our implementation team during the fourth quarter to support delivery of our growing backlog and pipeline, but we'll likely continue to see some pressure on professional services revenue in the near term as those teams ramp up to become fully billable. Subscriptions revenue was just slightly above Q3 of last year due to the expected $37 million decline in COVID-related subscription revenue, but organically rose 14.5%. We added 153 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 70 existing on-premises clients, representing a total of approximately $149 million in contract value. In Q3 of last year, we added 144 new subscription-based arrangements and had 67 on-premises conversions, representing a total of approximately $84 million in contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the third quarter added $28.1 million in new ARR. Subscription contract value comprised a new high of approximately 91% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 74% in Q3 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.8 years compared to 3.4 years last year. Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $148.9 million, down 13% but excluding COVID-related revenue, grew 11.1%. E-filing revenue reached a new high of $19.7 million, up 13.3%. Our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $1.49 billion, which was flat with last year, but up 11.2%, excluding COVID-related revenues. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was $421.7 million, up 27.7%. Transaction-based ARR was $595.6 million, down 13%, but up 11.1%, excluding COVID-related revenues. Non-GAAP maintenance ARR was flat with Q3 last year at $469.4 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was a new high of $1.88 billion, up 6.3%. Bookings in the quarter were approximately $499 million, down 17% on a difficult comparison to Q3 of last year for three main reasons. First, Q3 of last year included the State of Illinois fixed fee e-filing renewal of approximately $63 million. Second, COVID-related revenues and bookings were approximately $43 million in Q3 last year, versus $11 million in the current quarter. And finally, most of the Federal Department of State deals signed this quarter was not included in backlog or bookings. Normalizing for these items, bookings grew 7.7%. On an organic basis, bookings were approximately $364 million, down 17.9%, but grew 7.7% on a normalized basis. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.9 billion, up 18.1% and on an organic basis, were approximately $1.4 billion, up 2.1%. As a result of an increase in our estimated research tax credit, our annual GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were positively affected. Our non-GAAP annual effective tax rate is now 22.5%, down from the 24% previously used and the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 19.6% to adjust the year-to-date tax rate. This resulted in an $0.11 uplift to our third quarter non-GAAP EPS. For the full year, we expect this tax rate change to impact non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.14. Cash flows from operations were $129.4 million, down 37% and free cash flow was $115.6 million, down 40%, mainly due to the timing of working capital items such as payroll accruals, remittance of portal fees, and taxes and we expect to see positive impacts of these timing items in the fourth quarter. We continue to strengthen our already solid balance sheet. During the quarter, we repaid $190 million of our term debt and since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $665 million of term debt. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.085 billion and cash and investments of $247.9 million. As a reminder, $600 million of our debt is in the form of convertible debt with a fixed interest rate of 0.25%. The remaining $485 million is in pre-payable term debt due in 2024 and 2026, with interest at floating rates based on LIBOR plus a margin of 125 or 150 basis points. So, our exposure to floating rates is limited. We also have an undrawn $500 million revolver. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 1.79 times trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. Looking forward, we have adjusted the upper end of our full year revenue guidance to reflect lower license revenue as a result of a higher SaaS mix as well as the timing of new license contracts in our Public Safety and Federal divisions along with ongoing pressures on professional services revenue. Adjusted for the change in our effective tax rate, the midpoint of our non-EPS guidance is unchanged. Our updated 2022 guidance is as follows; we expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.837 billion and $1.857 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $49 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and Pandemic Rent Relief services. Revenue from TourHealth ended in the second quarter, while revenue from the Rent Relief program is expected to end in the fourth quarter. We expect GAAP EPS will be between $3.89 and $4.05 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option activity on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.51 and $7.65. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million, including approximately $7 million of non-cash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. For the full year, the net impact of the change in our tax rate, offset by increases in estimated interest expense, resulted in a $0.02 net reduction in non-GAAP EPS compared to our initial guidance. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn for his comments.\nLynn Moore: Thanks Brian. We're encouraged by continued strength in the public sector markets as reflected stable or increasing RFP and demo activity across our business units and a strong competitive position that continues to drive high win rates. Key characteristics of the public sector market is its relative stability across economic cycles, given the ongoing need to upgrade and replace aging mission-critical systems with next-generation applications. Our deep domain expertise, combined with the breadth of our product offerings, underscores our unique ability to deliver scalable and innovative digital solutions to meet these mission-critical needs. Our industry-leading competitive position remains high, in part due to our integrated solutions and our ability to expand existing client relationships as we leverage our installed base, the largest in the public sector market. Our cross-sell pipeline continues to grow, particularly as we begin to gain momentum with our NIC go-to-market strategy and leverage our strong sales organization and client relationships. Our pipeline of sell-through opportunities with NIC State Enterprise relationships expanded approximately 16% in the third quarter with emerging opportunities across multiple solutions with many influenced by our Enterprise Data and Insights offering. Additionally, we are seeing larger deal opportunities in the pipeline that require longer procurement cycles. Our cloud-first strategy is also tracking well as we continue to invest in optimizing products for more efficient cloud deployment and as higher cloud adoption is reflected in the mix of our new business pipeline. Our expectation of the SaaS mix for new business for this year and 2023 have increased since the beginning of the year. We've talked about the impact of our accelerated move to the cloud on our margins in 2022 and the expectation that we will see further margin contraction in 2023 before rebounding in 2024. In addition to impacting margins, the accelerated pace and the shift in new business mix towards SaaS puts pressure on revenue growth as we now expect 2022 license revenue to decline more than previously expected. We expect that trend to continue into 2023 and we are pleased that our early planning for next year indicates that SaaS adoption should increase even faster than previously expected, even in our Public Safety and federal divisions. As a result, we expect to see license revenue decline even more previously than anticipated with the license decline in the 40% range. Also, a reminder that with NIC's COVID-related initiatives now finished, $49 million of 2022 revenues, of which $11 million were in subscriptions and $38 million were in professional services will not be present in 2023. Despite current macroeconomic uncertainty, we continue to execute against our long-term growth strategy, capitalizing on the durability of our recurring revenue model and solid financial position. We have a proven and successful track record of strategic and opportunistic acquisitions that support our growth priorities, expand our product portfolio, and extend our TAM. As we have commented in the past, we have the benefit of reliable cash flow, enabling us to aggressively manage our debt profile and impact from rising interest rates. We expect to continue to delever and use excess cash to reduce debt while still taking advantage of strategic acquisitions at reasonable valuations such as Rapid, which further enhances our ability to address the significant public sector payments TAM. Our business is resilient and while we are not immune to the effects of inflation, the long-term capital investment decisions we've made in strengthening our products and shifting to a cloud-first approach are foundational to driving sustainable growth and delivering stakeholder value. With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Sami Badri of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nSami Badri: Hi, thank you. I have a couple of questions. First one is there was a mention of the ARPA project that was funded using federal funds. Could you kind of give us a characterization of what you guys see as the pipeline of potential projects and opportunities that are coming directly from federal funds? And on the second question -- my next question would be, on the what's a little bit intriguing about you guys making this comment is that it seems to be that there is a significant amount of federal funds being allocated to local governments, federal government, and several other branches. And you think that with those funds being allocated and the speed of those allocations that are now starting to accelerate, do you think that lead-times and procurement cycles would actually start to either stay the same or compress. So, I was hoping you could just kind of explain to us what's going on regarding longer procurement cycles.\nLynn Moore: Yes, sure, Sami. Let me start, and Brian jump in. First, on the ARPA deal, that was a really nice deal for a lot of reasons. As I mentioned in my comments, that was Hidalgo County, Texas. It was a full enterprise public safety suite deal, enforcement mobile civil process. ARPA funds were certainly a factor in getting that deal signed and funded. It's about $1.25 million license deal and about a $450,000 ARR deal. I think also what's interesting about that is that's a deal that also where our Tyler Alliance story really helped close the deal. So, some of the strategic things that we've been talking about are -- again, are continuing to resonate with our clients. It's also interesting because it's an AWS Gov cloud deployment, which is continuing. I think our comments around the -- what we're starting to see is more and more receptiveness in public safety to potentially move into the SaaS world. But yes, it was funded by ARPA. We track ARPA Funds. It's sometimes it's not easy to always identify specific deals tied to ARPA Funds because a lot of times these funds may be used for other things, which then free up funds for deals that we're pursuing. We see ARPA funds more often in areas where they are more like singular purchases. We expect to see some, for example, in school bus transportation deal where they're purchasing a large amount of hardware or something like that. The comment on longer procurement cycles, I don't want that to be taken out of context really. I think our cycles generally are on track with where they've been. I think the comment was really meant to say, as we're looking at more and more cross-sell opportunities through NIC and as those deals are getting larger, some of those larger deals are taking a little bit longer, but I wouldn't characterize procurement cycles across the Tyler portfolio of products is actually getting longer. So, if we misspoke there, I want to make that clarification.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you. Maybe just -- maybe double-clicking on the procurement cycles, excluding NIC and big deals. Are you starting to see an acceleration of deals getting signed as a function of federal funds, or has that not translated, or is not -- is that not really going through the way maybe some people thought it would go through in 2022?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. I don't think right now it's necessarily accelerating deals. We've talked before about our public sector clients. Their budgets are already healthy. The ARPA Funds are there. And as you know, some of them have limits on when those funds need to be spent. I don't think we're seeing that right now as a sense of urgency or emergency that they've got to flush all that through right now. And will that change over the next 12 months? It might, but we're not seeing that right now.\nSami Badri: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Pete Heckmann of D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nPete Heckmann: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Could you just revisit that piece you mentioned there towards the end of your prepared comments regarding the continued shift to software and potentially an acceleration of a decline in software license fees, could you repeat that comment? And then just specifically what time period are you looking at? Is it just reflecting next year, or I guess, is it a one-time event, or you expect really the software -- the remaining software revenue to decline faster than you had originally expected?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. Thanks, Pete. So I think what we're seeing is different divisions, different product suites have been moving at different paces to the cloud. Some of them we've talked before, like this year, our enterprise ERP solution is almost exclusively this year, and we budgeted this year to move to the cloud. Our lower end, or formerly our LGD, but our ERP Pro solution has continued to go at accelerated rates. What we're seeing is in areas, for example, like our enterprise, permitting and licensing solution, we budgeted this year that all new deals there would be 75% SaaS. And what we're seeing is they're 100% SaaS. We're starting to see it in our property and recording solutions, particularly our recording solution. We budgeted this year at 60% SaaS, it's 85% SaaS. What we're starting to see now also in the market and as we look into next year, is our two divisions, which have had really more dependency on licenses, particularly in the last couple of years has obviously been public safety and Tyler Federal, Tyler Federal has been moving, I think, a little bit faster to SaaS. And we've talked before in the past about public safety's lag. But public safety, what we're seeing now and as we're looking into next year, we're looking at a lot higher subscription based arrangements probably more so than we anticipated earlier in the year. And so as we look into 2023, we're seeing the effects now, but as we preliminary model, and again, this is not a 2023 call, but as we preliminarily look out to 2023, we see the licenses declining at a faster rate than we anticipated. And it's just a little bit shorter timeframe.\nPete Heckmann: Okay. And -- but as an offset, perhaps because you're not seeing necessarily a slowdown in contracting activity your subscription backlog should grow and potentially -- subscription revenue growth on an organic basis, several quarters out continue to be in the mid to high-teens. Does that seem accurate?\nLynn Moore: Yeah, I think so. I mean our market activity -- I'll. The market activity is strong right now. We're not seeing any impact of economic factors that may be affecting other industries, all our leading indicators, RFPs, demos. They've already been elevated. They're either continuing to increase or those elevated levels are being -- are stable right now. So we signed -- in Q3, we actually signed a record number of deals with our enterprise ERP and enterprise permitting and licensing solutions. So, the activity is there, the markets there, our clients' budgets are healthy. And so I think your comments are spot on.\nPete Heckmann: Okay, I appreciate. I'll back in queue.\nOperator: Your next question is from Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Yes, thanks very much. Lynn, in the cross-sell pipeline, when you think about the deals with NIC that are starting to come about, are there any specific Tyler products that are sort of merging together with NIC better than others, meaning makes sense to see the ERP -- ERP might not make a ton of sense in statewide deals, but I assume it be Courts & Justice. Can you just give a little bit more detail about what product categories or maybe attaching with NIC really well in some of the state deals?\nLynn Moore: Yes, sure, Kirk. It's a good question. I think out of the gate, our data and insights, our analytics product has been something that has been extremely well received, and that's still got a lot of opportunities. We are seeing a lot of areas in courts and justice just cross-selling our payment solutions. Tyler Federal as well. And I think you'll see as time goes on, probably areas like our permitting and licensing products. But the top three or four right now are really our analytics, courts and justice, federal and payments.\nKirk Materne: Okay, that's helpful. And Brian, as we start, I know preliminarily looking forward to 2023, can you just remind us of some of the puts and takes from a margin perspective for you guys next year? I know there's a lot going on with the transition to AWS, but some of the COVID-revenues going away, which I assume is pretty high margin for you all. Can you just give us some puts and takes maybe where you're going to have some pressure on margin, but maybe some offsets to that?\nBrian Miller: Yes, I'd say the biggest factor in terms of pressure on margins downward would be around the decline in licenses. So as we talked about in earlier question and during the prepared remarks, a very early look at next year's revenue plans would have licenses declining, perhaps around 40%. And as you know, licenses are very, very high margins. So -- and the time it takes the offsetting subscription revenues for the same deals in a subscription form to ramp up, there's a lag there. So, that would be the biggest downside pressure. The COVID revenue is going away generally. The COVID revenues, at least early on, the tour Health revenues were at lower than our average margins, the Virginia Rent Relief program margins were more in line with our overall margin. So, less of an uplift from those going away, but maybe overall a slight positive impact. And then subscriptions revenue -- I mean, services revenues, we've talked about being under some pressure, mostly from us still ramping up staffing. The services revenues typically are low to no margin revenues. And so the absence of those in the short-term has a positive impact. But again, we expect to ultimately build those back up. So, probably not as much of an overall impact from those, but potentially a slight positive impact from those being a little lighter. But certainly, the license decline around that shift is going to be the biggest factor by us taking a big step forward with that next year.\nLynn Moore: I'd also add, Kirk. We talked about it a lot back in February, a call, I think just sort of the ongoing bubble costs as we make this transition as we're running dual data centers and also moving into AWS. So that puts some pressure. But I would say, as you step back and you look at sort of as how we've been modeling out the next few years, which we've been doing for some time. This is all expected. This is what -- we expected 2023 to sort of be the highest -- the year with the most margin pressure. I think the impact on revenue growth is a little bit more than we expected in the beginning of the year. And I think that's a function of what we were talking about earlier, some of these other divisions probably moving quicker to subscriptions as that Brian just referenced.\nKirk Materne: Got it. Thanks guys. Congrats on the quarter. Operator: Your next question is from Michael Turrin of Wells Fargo Securities. Please, go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Turrin: Hey. Great. Thanks. Good morning. Appreciate you taking the questions. It's pretty clear, just in the commentary, the move to subscription and SaaS is happening a bit quicker than expected. The subscription TCV metric looks great. Can we just spend -- I appreciate just the categories you mentioned, but if you had to characterize why this is happening now, is there anything else you'd add just around how much has been fine-tuning the product set, your own go-to-market versus just customer interest and comfort levels of the cloud picking up and making those conversations a bit more palatable?\nLynn Moore: Yes, I think, it's all of the above, Michael. And we talked about -- what we saw is the changing landscape coming out of COVID. Fortunately, we had internally made this decision before COVID. A lot of it is around sales, how we're incentivizing sales. Some of it -- some announcements we've made around products, how we have various product lines that are over time that started this year that are going to be basically selling a cloud-only version. And so, it's market receptiveness, it's things -- it's improvements in our product and our -- what we've been doing, and it's what we're doing internally to drive that subscription growth.\nMichael Turrin: That's helpful. Brian, just one on the financials, if I may. The transaction-based revenue ticked down a bit sequentially. Can you remind us just how much of that is tied to NIC seasonality or just volatility versus some of the one-time impacts there? And maybe how we should think about just the seasonal profile of that line on a go-forward basis?\nBrian Miller: Yes, that line does tick down more so in the fourth quarter around seasonality of NIC transaction-based revenues. There's typically around the holidays as you move to the end of the year, there's just fewer transactions going through there. There also was year-over-year, a $37 million reduction in the transaction -- in the COVID revenues that are included in those transaction-based revenues and has also ticked down from Q2. So there's an impact there. And of course, those are going away permanently. But, yes, seasonality, a little bit in Q3, more so in Q4.\nLynn Moore: Yes. I think the -- for NIC, there are state enterprise transactions, which is a growing revenue line, and it's something that we're looking to grow, while it was up in Q3 year-over-year, it was down a little bit from Q2. So as Brian mentioned, Q2 is really the strongest for them seasonally and it goes down a little bit in Q3, and it's expected to taper in Q4, but that's to be expected.\nMichael Turrin: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from William McNemera [ph] of BTIG. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMatt VanVliet: Yes. Thanks. This is Matt VanVliet. I guess, first on the services capacity that you're seeing. You're talking about trying to catch up on hiring and having a little bit of a, I guess, a backlog of services to be deployed. So I guess two-part question. One, when do you expect to feel like you're sort of caught up there from both ramping the ones you've hired now and continuing to hire? And then second part, how much of that is limiting the subscription deployments and with that, the revenue recognition that might have missed or caused a little bit of a shortfall in the subscription growth versus what most of us were modeling?\nBrian Miller: Yes, there definitely is a little bit of that there. As you \u2013 you noted it's not a lack of services revenues coming in or the contracts being signed and then getting to the related initiation of the subscription revenues, but there have been delays around that. And we added a significant class or classes in late Q2 and have continued to hire in Q3 and Q4. It does seem that turnover, which has been at an elevated level with us as with many companies, does seem to be moderating somewhat. So that's a positive. But we think it's still -- it will take -- there's roughly, call it, a six-month lag time from the time we hire someone to the time they're really fully trained and billable. So this is a multiple quarter sort of exercise to catch back up. And it probably in some of the subscription deals is causing us to be maybe like a quarter or so behind when we might otherwise have started recognizing those revenues I guess, to an offsetting factor to some extent, our clients have often had elevated turnover as well. And so some of it is around client readiness to begin a project. And so some of these projects are delayed slightly because clients need to staff up before they're ready to launch into implementation. So we've seen effects from both sides and -- but there is some lag in the startup of subscription deals that are in backlog.\nMatt VanVliet: Okay. Helpful. And then looking at the state department deal that you announced, can you maybe just walk through some of the mechanics of why only a portion of that can be recognized in bookings and backlog, is it something you have to sort of earn your way into those other years on the contract, or how should we think about that going from $8 million to the $50-plus million that's in the headline number?\nBrian Miller: Yes, it's really pretty simple. I mean there are effectively termination for convenience provisions in there that we certainly don't expect to be to come into play. But when contracts have those terms under the accounting rules, we can only recognize in backlog and bookings, therefore, the sort of the first year revenues. We certainly expect that the full five years of the contract and potential extensions beyond that would be realized and that we'll get that full contract value, but those contract provisions limit us to what we can put in the backlog.\nMatt VanVliet: All right. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Joshua Reilly of Needham. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJoshua Reilly: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. How much of the decline at the high end of the guidance for the year in revenue is due to customers and public safety, increasingly choosing subscription versus license here in the short term because we know that Q4 is typically a seasonally strong quarter for public safety. And then how should we think about the implied impact to license versus services revenue here in Q4?\nLynn Moore: Hey Josh, let me start and then Brian will jump in. What we're seeing is, like I said, we're seeing more interest in moving to subscription-based models at public safety. A lot of the deals that we still have identified in Q4 are license deals. We have a lot of deals. You're right. Typically, Q4 is a strong quarter. We've got a lot of deals identified, and we've actually been -- we don't talk a lot about the selections, but a lot of selections. What we're seeing and what we're sort of forecasting is that some of those deals will actually slip into next year. So I think that's the majority of that there.\nBrian Miller: Yes, for around the timing of deals...\nLynn Moore: Getting done.\nBrian Miller: Getting done and whether that falls in Q4 or Q1 versus the mix right now. As we look forward into next year, as Lynn commented earlier, we do believe that a higher percentage of the public safety deals will be subscription deals. But I don't think that's really the case as much in Q4 as it is looking into next year.\nJoshua Reilly: Got it. That's super helpful. And then just a follow-up. Our work in the space I think others have been doing as well indicates that the competitive landscape in public safety for RMS and CAD is becoming more favorable for you guys. Can you speak to the opportunity there given your redesigned user interface and now cloud-ready offering for the opportunity to gain further market share there over the next few years? Thanks guys.\nLynn Moore: Yes, Josh, thanks. We like where we sit competitively. As you know, you follow us and I think follow some other players in the space. We've made a lot of investments there. We're winning deals against probably our top competitor there. We just came out of the IACP Conference, which was here in Dallas a couple of weeks ago. There were some interesting things that we saw or didn't see there. Some of those smaller competitors that we sort of grabbed some attention a couple of years ago. There was one that actually didn't have a presence at all. Another competitor had a significantly reduced presence. We've got another one who's carrying significant debt load, and we don't believe they're investing at the rates that they may would like to or certainly not the rates that we've been investing. So, we like where we sit. The investments we've made are paying off. We're still in the process of implementing a lot of deals, and these things take time when you go through this, but we're getting through that cycle and getting those verifications and getting those -- our references get stronger and stronger and I like where we sit with public safety going forward from a competitive standpoint.\nOperator: Your next question is from Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess just a few modeling ones and then a high level one. Brian, given the variability in kind of some of the line items on the cash flow statement, on a quarterly basis. It would be helpful just to better understand kind of where you guys are thinking of landing for free cash flow for the fourth quarter? And then also, understanding a little bit more about the impact to maintenance revenue for next year and consequently, kind of how you're thinking about next year from a cash flow growth standpoint, assuming, of course, that the margin step-down is about 100 to 150 basis points from where we would end this year?\nBrian Miller: Yeah. And again, we're not giving 2023 guidance yet. We've had more work around the revenue side than on the other side that we're not really in a position to talk about other than we do expect further compression about the extent of that next year on the margin perspective. I'd say next year, on maintenance, we'd expect that to be down probably low single digits based on the normal increases, the shift in new business more towards the cloud and then the lower level of licenses both this year of new licenses, both this year and next year. But I think it's still probably a low single-digit decline. The cash flow, yeah, I'd say probably our expectations for this year have ticked down a bit around that timing. We do believe that a lot of these timing changes that impacted this quarter versus the same quarter last year, turnaround in the fourth quarter. For example, at crude payroll, we had an extra payroll that ran through cash this quarter compared to last year. I think that turns around in Q4, but payroll for us today is close to $30 million. So that's shift from what we see in Q3 to what we see in Q4. Last year, some of the timing of NIC revenues, the flow of cash around their portals caused a bigger -- shift from Q2 last year to Q3 of last year. So it skews the comparison for this year a bit. And so I think probably our expectation has come down a bit, but a lot of this lightness in Q3 moves the other way into Q4. And as we said on the tax side, and with the change in our tax rate, that's not just a book tax rate, those are also cash taxes. And so we expect to have lower cash tax payments, actually no federal tax payment in Q4 and much lighter tax payments next year as well. And I'd say the overall mix on revenues and margins for next year, probably -- net-net, we probably come out pretty similar to this year's cash flow with maybe our increase is a bit less than we previously expected, but we still expect cash flow to grow. And part of that also, of course, interest will be significantly lower next year as a result of the debt payments we've made this year.\nAlex Zukin: Understood. And then maybe just -- and sorry, are you saying the cash flow margin for next year is going to be similar to this year, or the cash flow growth, or the dollar cash flow for next year?\nBrian Miller: Cash flow margin would be similar.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. Okay. And then, I guess, when you're looking at the acquisition you guys made, can you maybe just talk on where -- what were the incremental functionality or features that you guys saw an opportunity to add and double down on here that you didn't have or NIC didn't have. And if you think about the general M&A landscape, should we expect more in payments? Should we expect less in payments going forward? Do you have what you need here now?\nA \u2013 Lynn Moore: Yes. Thanks, Alex. I'm glad you asked that question. Because we're pretty excited about this acquisition. As you know, we view payments as really a significant long-term growth driver. And just a little history, remember, we were already in payments. We made the NIC acquisition, because they were the leader in public sector payments. But really, our expertise was on the acquiring side of payments. We had on our road map to get more involved on really the issuing side, generating the payouts. And we actually believe the issuing side of payments is about -- the TAM is about the same size as the acquiring side. When you talk about issuing side of payments, you monetize it by things like transaction load fees, there's interchange revenue, there's account fees. And Rapid was already currently in courts and corrections on the issuing side. That's -- again, that's an area we did not have expertise in, but something that we would have tried to build out sometime over time. But our focus still was on the acquiring side. We think in the near-term, we can -- we've already proven it, because they were a partner of VendEngine that we can in the near term, expand that presence in courts and corrections given our footprint. But then as we look across our Tyler portfolio and market presence, we see a lot of opportunities \u2013 other opportunities in the Justice space where it's Juror payments or in make work release or things like that on the state side, unemployment, unclaimed property, tax refunds, parks and outdoor, enterprise, federal, social services. There's all kinds of avenues that, I think we can build this out across our portfolio of existing products.  Caution is always, as we do acquisitions, they take time, but bringing in that expertise is something that gives us the full end-to-end cycle with respect to payments that we didn't have before and so, we're pretty excited about this opportunity. Obviously, we've got a lot of work ahead of us, a lot to go execute on, but it really rounds us out in the complete cycle where I don't think anybody else has the ability to play in that cycle.\nBrian Miller: And the only thing I'd add there is on the issuing side versus the acquiring side of the processing side, the margins are better. So that's also a positive.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you guys. Congrats on a good quarter.\nOperator: Your next question is from Charles Strauzer of CJS Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nCharles Strauzer: Hi, good morning. Just a quick circle back on the staffing topic. When you look at the \u2013 I know, Brian, you talked about turnover moderating and our finding a little bit easier to find headcount. Are you seeing any moderation to on the wage inflation?\nBrian Miller: Yes, Charlie, it's -- look, we say we have a little moderation. There is a little moderation. But we're \u2013 the labor challenges out there are real and they're present and it's not just us. Now historically, our turnover rates have been lower than others in the tech industry and we track that. We look at turnover, and we're down probably from Q1, our turnover is down about 10% from where it was in Q1, but it's still quite elevated from our historic levels. There are continuous pressures on wages. We're trying to address that where we can, but the labor market is tough right now. And we're trying to keep our people. We've got really good benefits. We've got a really good culture. People love to come to work here. Generally, we have pretty high engagement. We do internal surveys around that. but it's just a difficult market right now and we're trying to address it the best we can.\nCharles Strauzer: Great. And also just a quick question, kind of picking up back on the pipeline. I know that it's very robust right now. And you're seeing excellent activity, but are you hearing any trepidation from your clients at all about -- with all the recession talk?\nLynn Moore: We haven't seen it. And we just came out of our quarterly management meetings last week. And obviously, that was a question I asked each of our managers. And right now, we're just not seeing it. And we have to remember that, even though we've got what I call choppy waters out there in the economic world, our clients' budgets are still real healthy and they've been healthy for some time, and that's excluding any ARPA funding or things like that. So right now, we're not seeing it. It's something we continue to ask and probe into, but we're not seeing it right now.\nCharles Strauzer: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from Saket Kalia of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey guys thanks for taking my questions here. Brian, maybe I'll start with you. I was curious if you could talk a little bit about how bookings did versus your expectations. Great to see the SaaS mix go over 90%. Maybe a little curious how the denominator in that equation did and whether we stay at that 90% mix in future quarters?\nBrian Miller: I don't think we stay at the 90% mix, at least near-term in future quarters that was skewed by the Department of State contract, we talked about...\nLynn Moore: 90% of the value.\nBrian Miller: 90% of the value. In terms of the number of deals, it was 74% subscription and 26% on-prem, which is -- I'm sorry\u2026\nLynn Moore: 78%.\nBrian Miller: Yeah. 78%. And -- so I don't think we stay at 90% of the value because it was a bit skewed by that $54 million deal in -- with the Department of State. The total value, though, really grew nicely. So the highest -- it grew sequentially from last quarter from $126 million to $145 million. It's double what the first quarter total contract value was. So net-net, we feel really good about it. The comparison to last end and we feel good about the continued trend towards more, more cloud in the new bookings. The comparison, as we said, was very difficult, because we had a big -- well, in overall bookings last year, it wasn't software booking, but the e-filing in Illinois was a $63 million value. The -- and then, of course, the COVID revenues flow through bookings and the reduction there affected it as well. But that was certainly expected. So I'd say in an overall sense, probably the number of contracts and the value of those contracts was a bit higher than we expected coming into the quarter and skewed a bit by the Department of State deal.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Lynn, maybe just a higher level question on this topic, in your prepared remarks, clearly this year, you and the team have made changes to encourage SaaS adoption, whether it was sales incentives or end of life-ing some perpetual SKUs. To the extent that you can -- are there any levers that you can talk about that the team can maybe pull or sort of tweak next year to continue that momentum.\nLynn Moore: Well, I think we've already got those levers in place as it relates to the new business market. There's, other levers around flips. Those obviously come with added expense. We're still, again, early in our or planning for 2023 and what we're going to target for flips. But I would say that's probably an additional lever. But on the new business market, the things that we've done with product, as you said, the announcements we've made to clients, the things we're doing around sales they're all working in that direction. And part of it, too, is going back is we're taking a very solid, but traditional Tyler deliberate approach to this. And some of this has been around timing of when some of the products have been more cloud efficient ready to be pulling those levers.\nSaket Kalia: Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from Terry Tillman of Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nTerry Tillman: Yeah. Thanks for fitting me in as well and taking my questions. I guess, the first question is, we've got some research that we've been gathering in terms of the federal business and some really interesting incremental opportunities for you going forward. It was good to see this deal -- this large deal in the quarter. What can you say about what's going on in the federal side, whether it's case management with Entellitrak or other areas, do you feel like there's an inflection point and potentially a step-up in federal business? And then I had a follow-up.\nLynn Moore: Yes, that's a great question, Terry. I'm actually very encouraged with what I'm seeing in our federal business. The number of deals that we were chasing this year over last year, the size of the deals that we were chasing this year over last year. And I'm highlighting mostly Q3, although, it's things spill over into Q4. The opportunities have grown, the deal size has grown. We've got an excellent sales staff that does -- just does a fabulous job out there. And I'm bullish on where they're going in the future.\nTerry Tillman: That's great. And maybe just a follow-up for you or Brian. As we think into 2023 and really over a multiyear period, how do we think about the mix of SaaS and transaction revenue in that subscription line item? I know there's some noise still that we have to grapple with COVID-related maybe transactional revenue. But just in 2023 and beyond, do you see a market shift between those two line items? And what would be the gross margin implications, if any? Thank you.\nBrian Miller: Well, at a really high level, taking out the short-term impact of next year, there being none of the COVID-related revenues in there. And this year, there being a significant amount. Generally, we would expect to see really good growth there, mostly around the payment side. We believe that over time, the portal revenues will continue to trend upward as more and more citizens look to do more things digitally with government that they used to do through another channel in person or through the mail and that governments look to be able to provide more of those services digitally to citizens. But I think the big growth there, we've talked about, we expect to continue to see our payments business grow meaningfully through things like with the Rapid acquisition, getting more into the dispersing side and driving the NIC payments platform that's currently primarily at the state level down into our local government customers, and we expect to start to see fruits of that next year. In general, the margins on payments are a bit lower, particularly where we have gross contracts. There's a mix of growth in net, but generally, the margins are a bit lower there. But as far as incremental growth opportunities, we do expect to see, if you're looking out, say, over the next five years to seven years, significant growth around the payment side.\nLynn Moore: Yes. I think it's a little early to sort of forecast margins on the transaction side because of what Brian just said on the payments and the arrangements and how these things go. For example, as we announced last quarter, we won the competitive rebid for South Carolina. In the past, that was a gross revenue payment contracts. That's actually shifting to a net revenue. So that will have actually a revenue headwind next year, but it will be a more positive margin headwind. So as we sort of map out our payments future, and figure out exactly where we think we're going to be growing growth side, where we'll be growing debt side, we'll probably be able to give a little better color there.\nTerry Tillman: That\u2019s great. Good luck in 4Q. Thank you \nOperator: Your next question is from Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nKeith Housum: Thanks. Appreciate it. Good morning. Just a follow-up on the Rapid Financial acquisition. Brian, I think you mentioned the margin profile was better. Can you elaborate, was that better than the acquiring side or better than Tyler's general operating margins?\nBrian Miller: It's better than the acquiring side. I was just talking about on a relative basis. The dispersing side or the issuing side has better overall margins than acquiring.\nKeith Housum: Got you. Got you. And then following up on the Department of State contract, you mentioned you guys going -- you recognized $8 million of that $54 million in backlog. I think over time, we've heard that same comment about other contracts. As you look at some of the contracts like that, I mean, one, is that true? And then two, how is that growing over time in terms of the contracts are signed that you just can't recognize all of that in the backlog?\nBrian Miller: It's pretty rare. It's not in a lot of contracts. We've seen it in -- I think we've had a similar thing with e-filing contracts if they weren't -- we would have a multiyear contract, but if they weren't a fixed fee, there were times we couldn't put the whole contract in value in there, are occasionally, but I'd say it's a handful of times within a year and generally not on contracts of this size, but we fully expect that the Department of State will fully utilize this contract. They're already in existing clients. So this represents a big expansion from what we've already done for them. And we have a multiyear relationship with them already. So we certainly don't expect that the termination for convenience, provisions would come into play. But from an accounting perspective, they do govern how we can recognize in backlog. .\nKeith Housum: Great. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your last question is from Joe Goodwin of JMP Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nJoe Goodwin: Great. Thank you for taking my question. Is there any update on the NIC contract with the IRS that was those put on pause about a year ago?\nLynn Moore: Yes. We did the -- well, there's no meaningful update that we submitted our rebid. We're expecting the IRS to award I think sometime in the next month or so, we're fully expecting to get that award. But there's no material update that I'm aware. Brian?\nBrian Miller: No. The expected notification in the fourth quarter, but..\nLynn Moore: Fortunately not happened yet.\nBrian Miller: And that, that would be for a start in -- at the beginning of 2024. So that would be a full year ramp up and set up from the time the award takes place until the revenues would actually start.\nJoe Goodwin: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Lynn Moore for closing remarks.\nLynn Moore: Great. Thanks, Carol, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to myself or Brian Miller. Thanks, everybody. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the third quarter ended September 30th, 2022. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We have also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financials tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $473.2 million, up 2.9% and 2.7%, respectively. Organic revenue growth, excluding COVID-related revenues was strong at 9% on a GAAP basis and 8.8% on a non-GAAP basis. NIC's COVID-related revenues for the quarter were $11.7 million compared to $43.3 million in last year's third quarter. Revenue from the TourHealth initiative ended in the second quarter and the Virginia Rent Relief program has now officially ended with less than $2 million of remaining revenues anticipated in the fourth quarter. License revenue declined 10.6% as our new software contract mix has shifted to SaaS even more rapidly than planned at the beginning of the year. Professional services revenues rose 15.7% and 6.3% organically. We intend to continue to grow our implementation team during the fourth quarter to support delivery of our growing backlog and pipeline, but we'll likely continue to see some pressure on professional services revenue in the near term as those teams ramp up to become fully billable. Subscriptions revenue was just slightly above Q3 of last year due to the expected $37 million decline in COVID-related subscription revenue, but organically rose 14.5%. We added 153 new subscription-based arrangements and converted 70 existing on-premises clients, representing a total of approximately $149 million in contract value. In Q3 of last year, we added 144 new subscription-based arrangements and had 67 on-premises conversions, representing a total of approximately $84 million in contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the third quarter added $28.1 million in new ARR. Subscription contract value comprised a new high of approximately 91% of total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 74% in Q3 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.8 years compared to 3.4 years last year. Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $148.9 million, down 13% but excluding COVID-related revenue, grew 11.1%. E-filing revenue reached a new high of $19.7 million, up 13.3%. Our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $1.49 billion, which was flat with last year, but up 11.2%, excluding COVID-related revenues. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was $421.7 million, up 27.7%. Transaction-based ARR was $595.6 million, down 13%, but up 11.1%, excluding COVID-related revenues. Non-GAAP maintenance ARR was flat with Q3 last year at $469.4 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was a new high of $1.88 billion, up 6.3%. Bookings in the quarter were approximately $499 million, down 17% on a difficult comparison to Q3 of last year for three main reasons. First, Q3 of last year included the State of Illinois fixed fee e-filing renewal of approximately $63 million. Second, COVID-related revenues and bookings were approximately $43 million in Q3 last year, versus $11 million in the current quarter. And finally, most of the Federal Department of State deals signed this quarter was not included in backlog or bookings. Normalizing for these items, bookings grew 7.7%. On an organic basis, bookings were approximately $364 million, down 17.9%, but grew 7.7% on a normalized basis. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.9 billion, up 18.1% and on an organic basis, were approximately $1.4 billion, up 2.1%. As a result of an increase in our estimated research tax credit, our annual GAAP and non-GAAP effective tax rates were positively affected. Our non-GAAP annual effective tax rate is now 22.5%, down from the 24% previously used and the non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 19.6% to adjust the year-to-date tax rate. This resulted in an $0.11 uplift to our third quarter non-GAAP EPS. For the full year, we expect this tax rate change to impact non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.14. Cash flows from operations were $129.4 million, down 37% and free cash flow was $115.6 million, down 40%, mainly due to the timing of working capital items such as payroll accruals, remittance of portal fees, and taxes and we expect to see positive impacts of these timing items in the fourth quarter. We continue to strengthen our already solid balance sheet. During the quarter, we repaid $190 million of our term debt and since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $665 million of term debt. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.085 billion and cash and investments of $247.9 million. As a reminder, $600 million of our debt is in the form of convertible debt with a fixed interest rate of 0.25%. The remaining $485 million is in pre-payable term debt due in 2024 and 2026, with interest at floating rates based on LIBOR plus a margin of 125 or 150 basis points. So, our exposure to floating rates is limited. We also have an undrawn $500 million revolver. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 1.79 times trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. Looking forward, we have adjusted the upper end of our full year revenue guidance to reflect lower license revenue as a result of a higher SaaS mix as well as the timing of new license contracts in our Public Safety and Federal divisions along with ongoing pressures on professional services revenue. Adjusted for the change in our effective tax rate, the midpoint of our non-EPS guidance is unchanged. Our updated 2022 guidance is as follows; we expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.837 billion and $1.857 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $49 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and Pandemic Rent Relief services. Revenue from TourHealth ended in the second quarter, while revenue from the Rent Relief program is expected to end in the fourth quarter. We expect GAAP EPS will be between $3.89 and $4.05 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option activity on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.51 and $7.65. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $28 million, including approximately $7 million of non-cash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. For the full year, the net impact of the change in our tax rate, offset by increases in estimated interest expense, resulted in a $0.02 net reduction in non-GAAP EPS compared to our initial guidance. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn for his comments. Yes, I'd say the biggest factor in terms of pressure on margins downward would be around the decline in licenses. So as we talked about in earlier question and during the prepared remarks, a very early look at next year's revenue plans would have licenses declining, perhaps around 40%. And as you know, licenses are very, very high margins. So -- and the time it takes the offsetting subscription revenues for the same deals in a subscription form to ramp up, there's a lag there. So, that would be the biggest downside pressure. The COVID revenue is going away generally. The COVID revenues, at least early on, the tour Health revenues were at lower than our average margins, the Virginia Rent Relief program margins were more in line with our overall margin. So, less of an uplift from those going away, but maybe overall a slight positive impact. And then subscriptions revenue -- I mean, services revenues, we've talked about being under some pressure, mostly from us still ramping up staffing. The services revenues typically are low to no margin revenues. And so the absence of those in the short-term has a positive impact. But again, we expect to ultimately build those back up. So, probably not as much of an overall impact from those, but potentially a slight positive impact from those being a little lighter. But certainly, the license decline around that shift is going to be the biggest factor by us taking a big step forward with that next year. Yes, that line does tick down more so in the fourth quarter around seasonality of NIC transaction-based revenues. There's typically around the holidays as you move to the end of the year, there's just fewer transactions going through there. There also was year-over-year, a $37 million reduction in the transaction -- in the COVID revenues that are included in those transaction-based revenues and has also ticked down from Q2. So there's an impact there. And of course, those are going away permanently. But, yes, seasonality, a little bit in Q3, more so in Q4. Yes, there definitely is a little bit of that there. As you \u2013 you noted it's not a lack of services revenues coming in or the contracts being signed and then getting to the related initiation of the subscription revenues, but there have been delays around that. And we added a significant class or classes in late Q2 and have continued to hire in Q3 and Q4. It does seem that turnover, which has been at an elevated level with us as with many companies, does seem to be moderating somewhat. So that's a positive. But we think it's still -- it will take -- there's roughly, call it, a six-month lag time from the time we hire someone to the time they're really fully trained and billable. So this is a multiple quarter sort of exercise to catch back up. And it probably in some of the subscription deals is causing us to be maybe like a quarter or so behind when we might otherwise have started recognizing those revenues I guess, to an offsetting factor to some extent, our clients have often had elevated turnover as well. And so some of it is around client readiness to begin a project. And so some of these projects are delayed slightly because clients need to staff up before they're ready to launch into implementation. So we've seen effects from both sides and -- but there is some lag in the startup of subscription deals that are in backlog. Yes, it's really pretty simple. I mean there are effectively termination for convenience provisions in there that we certainly don't expect to be to come into play. But when contracts have those terms under the accounting rules, we can only recognize in backlog and bookings, therefore, the sort of the first year revenues. We certainly expect that the full five years of the contract and potential extensions beyond that would be realized and that we'll get that full contract value, but those contract provisions limit us to what we can put in the backlog. Yes, for around the timing of deals... Getting done and whether that falls in Q4 or Q1 versus the mix right now. As we look forward into next year, as Lynn commented earlier, we do believe that a higher percentage of the public safety deals will be subscription deals. But I don't think that's really the case as much in Q4 as it is looking into next year. Yeah. And again, we're not giving 2023 guidance yet. We've had more work around the revenue side than on the other side that we're not really in a position to talk about other than we do expect further compression about the extent of that next year on the margin perspective. I'd say next year, on maintenance, we'd expect that to be down probably low single digits based on the normal increases, the shift in new business more towards the cloud and then the lower level of licenses both this year of new licenses, both this year and next year. But I think it's still probably a low single-digit decline. The cash flow, yeah, I'd say probably our expectations for this year have ticked down a bit around that timing. We do believe that a lot of these timing changes that impacted this quarter versus the same quarter last year, turnaround in the fourth quarter. For example, at crude payroll, we had an extra payroll that ran through cash this quarter compared to last year. I think that turns around in Q4, but payroll for us today is close to $30 million. So that's shift from what we see in Q3 to what we see in Q4. Last year, some of the timing of NIC revenues, the flow of cash around their portals caused a bigger -- shift from Q2 last year to Q3 of last year. So it skews the comparison for this year a bit. And so I think probably our expectation has come down a bit, but a lot of this lightness in Q3 moves the other way into Q4. And as we said on the tax side, and with the change in our tax rate, that's not just a book tax rate, those are also cash taxes. And so we expect to have lower cash tax payments, actually no federal tax payment in Q4 and much lighter tax payments next year as well. And I'd say the overall mix on revenues and margins for next year, probably -- net-net, we probably come out pretty similar to this year's cash flow with maybe our increase is a bit less than we previously expected, but we still expect cash flow to grow. And part of that also, of course, interest will be significantly lower next year as a result of the debt payments we've made this year. Cash flow margin would be similar. And the only thing I'd add there is on the issuing side versus the acquiring side of the processing side, the margins are better. So that's also a positive. Yes, Charlie, it's -- look, we say we have a little moderation. There is a little moderation. But we're \u2013 the labor challenges out there are real and they're present and it's not just us. Now historically, our turnover rates have been lower than others in the tech industry and we track that. We look at turnover, and we're down probably from Q1, our turnover is down about 10% from where it was in Q1, but it's still quite elevated from our historic levels. There are continuous pressures on wages. We're trying to address that where we can, but the labor market is tough right now. And we're trying to keep our people. We've got really good benefits. We've got a really good culture. People love to come to work here. Generally, we have pretty high engagement. We do internal surveys around that. but it's just a difficult market right now and we're trying to address it the best we can. I don't think we stay at the 90% mix, at least near-term in future quarters that was skewed by the Department of State contract, we talked about... 90% of the value. In terms of the number of deals, it was 74% subscription and 26% on-prem, which is -- I'm sorry... Yeah. 78%. And -- so I don't think we stay at 90% of the value because it was a bit skewed by that $54 million deal in -- with the Department of State. The total value, though, really grew nicely. So the highest -- it grew sequentially from last quarter from $126 million to $145 million. It's double what the first quarter total contract value was. So net-net, we feel really good about it. The comparison to last end and we feel good about the continued trend towards more, more cloud in the new bookings. The comparison, as we said, was very difficult, because we had a big -- well, in overall bookings last year, it wasn't software booking, but the e-filing in Illinois was a $63 million value. The -- and then, of course, the COVID revenues flow through bookings and the reduction there affected it as well. But that was certainly expected. So I'd say in an overall sense, probably the number of contracts and the value of those contracts was a bit higher than we expected coming into the quarter and skewed a bit by the Department of State deal. Well, at a really high level, taking out the short-term impact of next year, there being none of the COVID-related revenues in there. And this year, there being a significant amount. Generally, we would expect to see really good growth there, mostly around the payment side. We believe that over time, the portal revenues will continue to trend upward as more and more citizens look to do more things digitally with government that they used to do through another channel in person or through the mail and that governments look to be able to provide more of those services digitally to citizens. But I think the big growth there, we've talked about, we expect to continue to see our payments business grow meaningfully through things like with the Rapid acquisition, getting more into the dispersing side and driving the NIC payments platform that's currently primarily at the state level down into our local government customers, and we expect to start to see fruits of that next year. In general, the margins on payments are a bit lower, particularly where we have gross contracts. There's a mix of growth in net, but generally, the margins are a bit lower there. But as far as incremental growth opportunities, we do expect to see, if you're looking out, say, over the next five years to seven years, significant growth around the payment side. It's better than the acquiring side. I was just talking about on a relative basis. The dispersing side or the issuing side has better overall margins than acquiring. It's pretty rare. It's not in a lot of contracts. We've seen it in -- I think we've had a similar thing with e-filing contracts if they weren't -- we would have a multiyear contract, but if they weren't a fixed fee, there were times we couldn't put the whole contract in value in there, are occasionally, but I'd say it's a handful of times within a year and generally not on contracts of this size, but we fully expect that the Department of State will fully utilize this contract. They're already in existing clients. So this represents a big expansion from what we've already done for them. And we have a multiyear relationship with them already. So we certainly don't expect that the termination for convenience, provisions would come into play. But from an accounting perspective, they do govern how we can recognize in backlog. . No. The expected notification in the fourth quarter, but.. And that, that would be for a start in -- at the beginning of 2024. So that would be a full year ramp up and set up from the time the award takes place until the revenues would actually start."

Next, I'll have some comments on our quarter, and then Brian will review the details of our results. I'll end with some additional comments, and then we'll take questions. Brian? Thanks Brian. Our third quarter results were highlighted by strong execution that drove solid organic revenue growth and higher earnings while also advancing our cloud-first strategy. Total revenues grew approximately 3% with organic growth, excluding COVID-related revenues of approximately 9%. Recurring revenues comprised 78.5% of our quarterly revenues. On an organic basis, excluding COVID-related revenues, subscription revenue grew 14.5%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth in transaction-based revenues. We achieved solid revenue growth even as the shift in new software contracts mix continue to accelerate to SaaS from licenses. In Q3, 91% of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 74% in Q3 last year. Our largest new software contract for the quarter was with the US Department of State for our case management development platform, formerly known as entellitrak. This five-year SaaS arrangement is valued at over $54 million and includes over $5 million of ARR in the first year, ramping to over $8.5 million of ARR in the fifth year. However, due to certain contract terms, only approximately $8 million of the value of this contract is included in backlog and bookings for the third quarter. The second largest deal of the quarter was a five-year SaaS deal for our enterprise supervision solution with the Arizona Office of the Courts valued at over $15 million. This arrangement includes two five-year optional renewals and with add-on components has the potential to grow to more than $82 million over 15 years. We also signed a notable statewide SaaS deal for our enterprise supervision solution with the State of Oregon Judicial Department valued at approximately $3.5 million. These contracts are great examples of our ability to make a strategic tuck-in acquisition and grow the acquired products by leveraging our client base and sales channel. When we acquired CaseloadPRO, which is now our Enterprise Supervision Product four years ago, its annual revenues were approximately $2.7 million. This quarter alone, our new sales of Enterprise Supervision added almost $4 million of ARR. In other Tyler divisions, we signed five additional significant SaaS deals each for different product suites and each with a total contract value greater than $2 million. Those include Pierce County, Washington for our Enterprise Assessment and Tax solution, the City of Abilene, Texas, the Resin Unified School District in Wisconsin, and Alachua County, Florida for our Enterprise ERP solution, the Toronto Region Conservation Authority in Ontario for Enterprise Permitting and Licensing Solution. In addition, we signed 12 SaaS deals in the quarter with contract values between $1 million and $2 million each. We also signed three notable license deals in the quarter for Enterprise Public Safety, Enforcement Mobile and Data & Insight solutions. With Hidalgo County, Texas, which was funded by ARPA, the combined Regional Communications Authority in Colorado and the city of Melbourne, Florida. Also during the third quarter, we successfully renewed our NIC enterprise contract in Alabama and won a competitive rebid for our enterprise contract in Maine. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, in October, we renewed our NIC enterprise contract in Oklahoma, and our contract in Pennsylvania is expected to expire in the fourth quarter. We also converted our State of Iowa data and insights agreement from a third-party reseller to the NIC master contract. In addition, NIC signed a new four-year SaaS agreement for our medical cannabis regulation solution with the Arkansas Department of Health, Medical cannabis licensing with ARR of approximately $450,000. Before I turn the call over to Brian, I'd like to comment on the Rapid Financial Solutions acquisition we announced this morning. We're extremely excited to partner with the innovative team at Rapid, who will join our payments group. Rapid is a leader in the payment solutions market with 20 years' experience and expands our capabilities with best-in-class digital disbursements. We will now be able to offer our public sector clients a reliable, scalable, and secure platform for disbursing payments. Rapid has more than 1,500 customers concentrated in courts and correction facilities which includes managing disbursements for VendEngine, which we acquired in September of last year. Combined with our approximately 7,200 clients in the payment space, we believe this is a significant opportunity to leverage the full suite of market-leading payment solutions to make customer interactions stronger and more secure. Now, I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results of the quarter, and our annual guidance for 2022. Thanks Brian. We're encouraged by continued strength in the public sector markets as reflected stable or increasing RFP and demo activity across our business units and a strong competitive position that continues to drive high win rates. Key characteristics of the public sector market is its relative stability across economic cycles, given the ongoing need to upgrade and replace aging mission-critical systems with next-generation applications. Our deep domain expertise, combined with the breadth of our product offerings, underscores our unique ability to deliver scalable and innovative digital solutions to meet these mission-critical needs. Our industry-leading competitive position remains high, in part due to our integrated solutions and our ability to expand existing client relationships as we leverage our installed base, the largest in the public sector market. Our cross-sell pipeline continues to grow, particularly as we begin to gain momentum with our NIC go-to-market strategy and leverage our strong sales organization and client relationships. Our pipeline of sell-through opportunities with NIC State Enterprise relationships expanded approximately 16% in the third quarter with emerging opportunities across multiple solutions with many influenced by our Enterprise Data and Insights offering. Additionally, we are seeing larger deal opportunities in the pipeline that require longer procurement cycles. Our cloud-first strategy is also tracking well as we continue to invest in optimizing products for more efficient cloud deployment and as higher cloud adoption is reflected in the mix of our new business pipeline. Our expectation of the SaaS mix for new business for this year and 2023 have increased since the beginning of the year. We've talked about the impact of our accelerated move to the cloud on our margins in 2022 and the expectation that we will see further margin contraction in 2023 before rebounding in 2024. In addition to impacting margins, the accelerated pace and the shift in new business mix towards SaaS puts pressure on revenue growth as we now expect 2022 license revenue to decline more than previously expected. We expect that trend to continue into 2023 and we are pleased that our early planning for next year indicates that SaaS adoption should increase even faster than previously expected, even in our Public Safety and federal divisions. As a result, we expect to see license revenue decline even more previously than anticipated with the license decline in the 40% range. Also, a reminder that with NIC's COVID-related initiatives now finished, $49 million of 2022 revenues, of which $11 million were in subscriptions and $38 million were in professional services will not be present in 2023. Despite current macroeconomic uncertainty, we continue to execute against our long-term growth strategy, capitalizing on the durability of our recurring revenue model and solid financial position. We have a proven and successful track record of strategic and opportunistic acquisitions that support our growth priorities, expand our product portfolio, and extend our TAM. As we have commented in the past, we have the benefit of reliable cash flow, enabling us to aggressively manage our debt profile and impact from rising interest rates. We expect to continue to delever and use excess cash to reduce debt while still taking advantage of strategic acquisitions at reasonable valuations such as Rapid, which further enhances our ability to address the significant public sector payments TAM. Our business is resilient and while we are not immune to the effects of inflation, the long-term capital investment decisions we've made in strengthening our products and shifting to a cloud-first approach are foundational to driving sustainable growth and delivering stakeholder value. With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A. Yes, sure, Sami. Let me start, and Brian jump in. First, on the ARPA deal, that was a really nice deal for a lot of reasons. As I mentioned in my comments, that was Hidalgo County, Texas. It was a full enterprise public safety suite deal, enforcement mobile civil process. ARPA funds were certainly a factor in getting that deal signed and funded. It's about $1.25 million license deal and about a $450,000 ARR deal. I think also what's interesting about that is that's a deal that also where our Tyler Alliance story really helped close the deal. So, some of the strategic things that we've been talking about are -- again, are continuing to resonate with our clients. It's also interesting because it's an AWS Gov cloud deployment, which is continuing. I think our comments around the -- what we're starting to see is more and more receptiveness in public safety to potentially move into the SaaS world. But yes, it was funded by ARPA. We track ARPA Funds. It's sometimes it's not easy to always identify specific deals tied to ARPA Funds because a lot of times these funds may be used for other things, which then free up funds for deals that we're pursuing. We see ARPA funds more often in areas where they are more like singular purchases. We expect to see some, for example, in school bus transportation deal where they're purchasing a large amount of hardware or something like that. The comment on longer procurement cycles, I don't want that to be taken out of context really. I think our cycles generally are on track with where they've been. I think the comment was really meant to say, as we're looking at more and more cross-sell opportunities through NIC and as those deals are getting larger, some of those larger deals are taking a little bit longer, but I wouldn't characterize procurement cycles across the Tyler portfolio of products is actually getting longer. So, if we misspoke there, I want to make that clarification. Yeah. I don't think right now it's necessarily accelerating deals. We've talked before about our public sector clients. Their budgets are already healthy. The ARPA Funds are there. And as you know, some of them have limits on when those funds need to be spent. I don't think we're seeing that right now as a sense of urgency or emergency that they've got to flush all that through right now. And will that change over the next 12 months? It might, but we're not seeing that right now. Yeah. Thanks, Pete. So I think what we're seeing is different divisions, different product suites have been moving at different paces to the cloud. Some of them we've talked before, like this year, our enterprise ERP solution is almost exclusively this year, and we budgeted this year to move to the cloud. Our lower end, or formerly our LGD, but our ERP Pro solution has continued to go at accelerated rates. What we're seeing is in areas, for example, like our enterprise, permitting and licensing solution, we budgeted this year that all new deals there would be 75% SaaS. And what we're seeing is they're 100% SaaS. We're starting to see it in our property and recording solutions, particularly our recording solution. We budgeted this year at 60% SaaS, it's 85% SaaS. What we're starting to see now also in the market and as we look into next year, is our two divisions, which have had really more dependency on licenses, particularly in the last couple of years has obviously been public safety and Tyler Federal, Tyler Federal has been moving, I think, a little bit faster to SaaS. And we've talked before in the past about public safety's lag. But public safety, what we're seeing now and as we're looking into next year, we're looking at a lot higher subscription based arrangements probably more so than we anticipated earlier in the year. And so as we look into 2023, we're seeing the effects now, but as we preliminary model, and again, this is not a 2023 call, but as we preliminarily look out to 2023, we see the licenses declining at a faster rate than we anticipated. And it's just a little bit shorter timeframe. Yeah, I think so. I mean our market activity -- I'll. The market activity is strong right now. We're not seeing any impact of economic factors that may be affecting other industries, all our leading indicators, RFPs, demos. They've already been elevated. They're either continuing to increase or those elevated levels are being -- are stable right now. So we signed -- in Q3, we actually signed a record number of deals with our enterprise ERP and enterprise permitting and licensing solutions. So, the activity is there, the markets there, our clients' budgets are healthy. And so I think your comments are spot on. Yes, sure, Kirk. It's a good question. I think out of the gate, our data and insights, our analytics product has been something that has been extremely well received, and that's still got a lot of opportunities. We are seeing a lot of areas in courts and justice just cross-selling our payment solutions. Tyler Federal as well. And I think you'll see as time goes on, probably areas like our permitting and licensing products. But the top three or four right now are really our analytics, courts and justice, federal and payments. I'd also add, Kirk. We talked about it a lot back in February, a call, I think just sort of the ongoing bubble costs as we make this transition as we're running dual data centers and also moving into AWS. So that puts some pressure. But I would say, as you step back and you look at sort of as how we've been modeling out the next few years, which we've been doing for some time. This is all expected. This is what -- we expected 2023 to sort of be the highest -- the year with the most margin pressure. I think the impact on revenue growth is a little bit more than we expected in the beginning of the year. And I think that's a function of what we were talking about earlier, some of these other divisions probably moving quicker to subscriptions as that Brian just referenced. Yes, I think, it's all of the above, Michael. And we talked about -- what we saw is the changing landscape coming out of COVID. Fortunately, we had internally made this decision before COVID. A lot of it is around sales, how we're incentivizing sales. Some of it -- some announcements we've made around products, how we have various product lines that are over time that started this year that are going to be basically selling a cloud-only version. And so, it's market receptiveness, it's things -- it's improvements in our product and our -- what we've been doing, and it's what we're doing internally to drive that subscription growth. Yes. I think the -- for NIC, there are state enterprise transactions, which is a growing revenue line, and it's something that we're looking to grow, while it was up in Q3 year-over-year, it was down a little bit from Q2. So as Brian mentioned, Q2 is really the strongest for them seasonally and it goes down a little bit in Q3, and it's expected to taper in Q4, but that's to be expected. Hey Josh, let me start and then Brian will jump in. What we're seeing is, like I said, we're seeing more interest in moving to subscription-based models at public safety. A lot of the deals that we still have identified in Q4 are license deals. We have a lot of deals. You're right. Typically, Q4 is a strong quarter. We've got a lot of deals identified, and we've actually been -- we don't talk a lot about the selections, but a lot of selections. What we're seeing and what we're sort of forecasting is that some of those deals will actually slip into next year. So I think that's the majority of that there. Getting done. Yes, Josh, thanks. We like where we sit competitively. As you know, you follow us and I think follow some other players in the space. We've made a lot of investments there. We're winning deals against probably our top competitor there. We just came out of the IACP Conference, which was here in Dallas a couple of weeks ago. There were some interesting things that we saw or didn't see there. Some of those smaller competitors that we sort of grabbed some attention a couple of years ago. There was one that actually didn't have a presence at all. Another competitor had a significantly reduced presence. We've got another one who's carrying significant debt load, and we don't believe they're investing at the rates that they may would like to or certainly not the rates that we've been investing. So, we like where we sit. The investments we've made are paying off. We're still in the process of implementing a lot of deals, and these things take time when you go through this, but we're getting through that cycle and getting those verifications and getting those -- our references get stronger and stronger and I like where we sit with public safety going forward from a competitive standpoint. We haven't seen it. And we just came out of our quarterly management meetings last week. And obviously, that was a question I asked each of our managers. And right now, we're just not seeing it. And we have to remember that, even though we've got what I call choppy waters out there in the economic world, our clients' budgets are still real healthy and they've been healthy for some time, and that's excluding any ARPA funding or things like that. So right now, we're not seeing it. It's something we continue to ask and probe into, but we're not seeing it right now. 90% of the value. 78%. Well, I think we've already got those levers in place as it relates to the new business market. There's, other levers around flips. Those obviously come with added expense. We're still, again, early in our or planning for 2023 and what we're going to target for flips. But I would say that's probably an additional lever. But on the new business market, the things that we've done with product, as you said, the announcements we've made to clients, the things we're doing around sales they're all working in that direction. And part of it, too, is going back is we're taking a very solid, but traditional Tyler deliberate approach to this. And some of this has been around timing of when some of the products have been more cloud efficient ready to be pulling those levers. Yes, that's a great question, Terry. I'm actually very encouraged with what I'm seeing in our federal business. The number of deals that we were chasing this year over last year, the size of the deals that we were chasing this year over last year. And I'm highlighting mostly Q3, although, it's things spill over into Q4. The opportunities have grown, the deal size has grown. We've got an excellent sales staff that does -- just does a fabulous job out there. And I'm bullish on where they're going in the future. Yes. I think it's a little early to sort of forecast margins on the transaction side because of what Brian just said on the payments and the arrangements and how these things go. For example, as we announced last quarter, we won the competitive rebid for South Carolina. In the past, that was a gross revenue payment contracts. That's actually shifting to a net revenue. So that will have actually a revenue headwind next year, but it will be a more positive margin headwind. So as we sort of map out our payments future, and figure out exactly where we think we're going to be growing growth side, where we'll be growing debt side, we'll probably be able to give a little better color there. Yes. We did the -- well, there's no meaningful update that we submitted our rebid. We're expecting the IRS to award I think sometime in the next month or so, we're fully expecting to get that award. But there's no material update that I'm aware. Brian? Fortunately not happened yet. Great. Thanks, Carol, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to myself or Brian Miller. Thanks, everybody. Have a good day."

Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. We're pleased with our second quarter results as the public sector market environment remains strong and RFP and demo activities continue to trend positively. We leveraged successful multi-suite wins and cross-selling efforts to deliver a solid quarter, and our strong competitive position, coupled with an active public sector market, drove a 21% increase in bookings. Overall, we see the challenging broader macro environment as an opportunity to support our clients by replacing aging mission-critical systems and adding advanced digital services to serve the public more efficiently. Total revenues grew approximately 16% with organic growth of 6.2%. Services revenues were flat on an organic basis, exhibiting some softness due to labor market challenges affecting our hiring of implementation resources. Recurring revenues comprised 79.5% of our quarterly revenues and were led by 28% growth in subscription revenues. On an organic basis, excluding COVID-related revenues, subscription revenues grew 14%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth in transaction-based revenues. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 58 of the last 66 quarters. We achieved solid revenue growth even as the shift in new software contract mix accelerates to SaaS from licenses. In Q2, 74% of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 65% in Q2 last year. As expected, margins compressed, reflecting the increase in our SaaS new business mix and the associated decline in license revenues as well as costs related to the cloud transition. Along with bookings performance, cash flow was a high point of the quarter as both cash flows from operations and free cash flow achieved new highs for a second quarter. April 21 marked the first anniversary of our NIC acquisition, and we continue to be excited about their performance and the growing pipeline of joint opportunities for both Tyler and NIC. NIC's core organic revenue growth was 8%. During the second quarter, we successfully extended our enterprise contracts in West Virginia, Vermont, Kansas and Kentucky. NIC also signed our largest ARR contract for the quarter, a new four-year arrangement with the state of New Jersey for digital motor vehicle titling solution, which we estimate will generate transaction-based revenues of approximately $5 million per year. In addition, NIC signed a new SaaS agreement for our cannabis solution with the states of Alabama and Illinois, which are both state enterprise clients. We continue to build momentum with our joint and cross-sell opportunities with NIC. Our active cross-sell pipeline doubled in value from Q1, and we closed three new deals with NIC clients, including the state of Utah for our Entellitrak Veterans Benefit System and the state of Kentucky for our VendEngine Resident Resources Solution. In other Tyler divisions, we signed four additional notable SaaS deals, each for different product suites and each with a total contract value greater than $3.8 million. Those include Maricopa County, Arizona, for our enterprise permitting and licensing solution; Lancaster, California for our enterprise ERP solution; Lima, Ohio for our enterprise justice and supervision solutions as well as our full suite of public safety applications; and Orange County, Florida for our enterprise assessment and tax solution. In addition, we signed six SaaS deals in the quarter with contract values between $2 million and $3 million each and 14 SaaS deals with contract values between $1 million and $2 million each. During the second quarter, we also amended our e-filing agreement with the state of Washington from a transaction-based volume arrangement to a fixed fee contract. The deal spans nine years for approximately $27 million. However, due to certain contract terms, the majority of this contract was not included in backlog or bookings this quarter. The deal adds approximately $2.8 million in ARR, expanding to over $3 million in ARR in the latter half of the agreement. Our largest new software contract in the quarter was a license deal with Montreal, Quebec for our enterprise assessment and tax solution valued at approximately $13 million. We also signed a second deal in Canada for the same solution with the Yukon territory worth approximately $2 million. In addition, we signed a significant license deal with Dallas County, Texas for our enterprise correction solution valued at approximately $4.5 million. Dallas County, which currently uses our enterprise case management solution, has the ninth largest jail system in the U.S., making it our largest jail client. Other significant license arrangements signed in the quarter, each with a total contract value of greater than $1 million include Charlotte County, Florida and Huntington Park, California for enterprise ERP solution; Fort Worth, Texas for our enforcement mobile solution; and Owasso, Oklahoma for our enterprise public safety, enforcement mobile and data and insight solutions. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2022.\nBrian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $468.7 million, up 16%, including NIC and our other acquisitions from the last 12 months. Organic revenue growth, excluding COVID-related revenues was 6.2% on a GAAP basis and 5.8% on a non-GAAP basis. NIC's COVID-related revenues for the quarter exceeded our expectations at $15.2 million. Revenues from the TourHealth initiatives concluded in the second quarter and the Virginia rent relief program is expected to be completed in the third quarter with about $8 million of revenues anticipated in the quarter. As expected, license revenues declined 14.7% as our new software contract mix continued to shift to SaaS. Software revenues rose 18.3% -- service revenues rose 18.3% but on an organic basis were essentially flat with last year. Services revenues were impacted by delays in hiring new professional services staff in the current labor market. While we hired a large class of implementers during the quarter, there is an onboarding period of several months before they will be fully billable. We intend to continue to grow our implementation team during the second half of the year to support delivery of our growing backlog and pipeline, but we'll likely continue to see some pressure on services revenues in the short term as those teams ramp up. Subscription revenues rose 28.2% with strong organic growth of 14.1%. We added 167 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a new high of 96 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $115 million in total contract value. In Q2 of last year, we added 170 new subscription-based arrangements and had 62 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the second quarter added $27.6 million in new ARR. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 74% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 65% in Q2 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.7 years compared to 4.1 years last year. Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $154.4 million, up 29.1%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 17.5%. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $18.5 million, up 14%. For the second quarter, our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $1.49 billion, up 16.3%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was approximately $405.6 million, up 24.9%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $617.7 million, up 29.1% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was down 2.3% at approximately $467.3 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was a new high of $1.85 billion, up 13.9%. Bookings in the quarter were very strong at approximately $562 million, up 21%, including transaction-based revenues. On an organic basis, bookings were also quite robust at approximately $423 million, up 16.3%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $2 billion, up 53.2% on an organic basis were approximately $1.5 billion up 21.1%. If our weighted average contract terms for new SaaS contracts had been the same as last year, organic bookings growth would have been 18.3%. As Lynn mentioned earlier, both cash flows from operations and free cash flow reached new highs for a second quarter. Cash flows from operations were $76.7 million and free cash flow rose to $60 million from negative $33.5 million last year. We continue to strengthen our already solid balance sheet. During the quarter, we repaid $60 million of our term debt. And since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $475 million of term debt. We will also pay down an additional $100 million in term debt at the end of this month. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.275 billion and cash and investments of $314 million. As a reminder, $600 million of our debt is in the form of convertible debt with an interest rate of 0.25% and the remainder is in prepayable term debt due in 2024 and 2026. We also have an undrawn $500 million revolver. Our net leverage at June 30 was approximately 2.07x trailing 12 months pro forma EBITDA and our leverage should be under 2x at the end of July. Interest rate hikes thus far this year and projected for the remainder of the year have resulted in significantly higher projected interest expense for the year than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. In addition, we have debt discounts and issuance costs related to our term debt that are being amortized as noncash interest expense. And as we prepay term debt, we are required to accelerate the amortization of those costs. Accordingly, we have adjusted our earnings guidance for the full year to reflect those changes in assumptions around interest. Our current guidance for the full year interest expense of $30 million represents an increase of about $7 million or approximately $0.12 per share for both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS compared to our previous guidance. The $7 million increase includes about $4 million of cash interest on term debt and $3 million of additional noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. It's important to note that our revenue guidance has not changed, and our expectations for operating margins are generally consistent with our previous outlook. Our updated 2022 guidance is as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.835 billion and $1.870 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 9%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $44 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and pandemic rent relief services. Revenues from TourHealth concluded in the second quarter, while revenues from the rent relief program are expected to wind down in the third quarter. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.60 and $3.76 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.36 and $7.52. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $30 million, including approximately $7.5 million of noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. Against the backdrop of generally strong public sector budgets supplemented by federal stimulus funds, we're experiencing a very active market. With our leading competitive position and ongoing investments in strategic initiatives, we are well positioned to take advantage of the continued strength in our market. The acquisitions we've made over the last 18 months, including NIC, VendEngine and US eDirect, are performing well and contributing to our strong competitive position, helping us create more cross-sell and upsell opportunities with both new and existing clients. In particular, our enthusiasm around the cross-sell opportunities through NIC continues to grow, with recent wins across multiple Tyler products and a rapidly growing pipeline of opportunities. We're also pleased with our progress around our combined payments business. as we begin to execute our go-to-market strategy to pursue a tremendous public sector payments TAM. We believe Tyler is uniquely qualified to deliver government-focused payment solutions, leveraging the strength of NIC's payment platform, analytics and reporting and deep domain expertise together with Tyler's broad software portfolio and extensive client base, and we look forward to reporting our progress in the coming quarters. Even as we face an uncertain economic macro environment with rising inflation and interest rates, we have a great deal of confidence in our ability to continue to generate solid financial results and to grow cash flow. There are a number of factors that make Tyler's business resilient and relatively defensive compared to many software peers. The public sector market is more stable than many segments of the private sector. We provide solutions that power essential government services often replacing mission-critical systems that are end of life, and our clients don't go out of business or get acquired. Recurring revenues comprised approximately 80% and growing of our total revenues, generating highly reliable cash flow. In addition, the public sector is increasingly focused on moving into the cloud, which we support with our cloud-first model. Our experience during the recession more than a decade ago supports our confidence and Tyler is clearly in a much stronger position today to succeed during an economic downturn. We also have the advantage of a very strong balance sheet and reliable cash flow, which enables us to continue to invest strategically in growth even if some competitors may be constrained. While we have term and convertible debt associated with the NIC acquisition and have been impacted by rising interest rates, we are modestly leveraged at approximately 2x adjusted EBITDA, and we expect to continue to delever. Accordingly, in the near term, we are prioritizing using our cash flow to reduce debt while retaining the flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments that provide long-term value. Finally, I'm happy to report that we remain on track with our major strategic initiatives, including projects related to optimizing our products for efficient deployment of the cloud, moving from our proprietary data centers to AWS, and ultimately accelerating the migration of our on-premise clients to the cloud and driving long-term margin expansion. With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sami Badri with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nSami Badri: First, I just wanted to ask about the sales cycle that you guys -- sorry, going back, looking at the larger deals that you guys announced, there were several this quarter. What was the sales cycle for these? Are sales cycles tightening, elongating? Are they in line with prior length? Any color on that? And then the second kind of question tied to that is we are seeing a strengthening state and local budget spend environment. And I think one question we do get from a lot of investors is how do you connect those revisions in those state and local budgets? And how do those end up making their way into companies, right, like yourselves? Could you kind of give us an idea from what you guys see in the field from the date budgets are announced to the date that they're actually translated into actual bookings or revenues on your side?\nLynn Moore: Yes, sure, Sami, it's Lynn. I'll start and I'll let Brian jump in. I think right now, our sales cycles are pretty normal. I think we've experienced times if you go back to the recession in '08, '09, that's where you started seeing things push out and get delayed. We saw a little bit of that during COVID. But I think the key is we continually talk about the fact that what we provide is essential functionality and the software that we do provide are things that are needed and they're often replacing out of date or systems. And so right now, the market looks good. The sales cycles are pretty typical for a normal healthy time, even with respect to those large deals. Sales cycles will vary a little bit across our different divisions. Some have longer than others. And sometimes the larger deals do take a little bit longer. But I think across the board, across our different product suites, I'd say sales cycles are pretty much on track. When you talk about state and local government spending environment, what we're seeing right now really is it's pretty healthy. I agree their budgets are in good shape. I've made comments before that I think coming out of COVID, they were not hit nearly as hard as a lot of people anticipated some of the journal reports and other things that we've read. Also with the infusion of some stimulus. And I know Brian's got some numbers and thoughts around ARPA. But I think right now, what we're seeing in our pipeline, all our leading indicators around RFPs and demos, things like that, you're seeing it a little bit in some of our bookings this quarter is that things are well right now in the state and local government.\nBrian Miller: And I'd just add a couple of things. Clearly, on the larger contracts, typically do have a longer sales cycle and some of these very large ones, sales cycles can be sometimes measured in years from the time we start talking to someone about a solution and the timing of when those actually show up in a signed contract can be somewhat unpredictable. And I'd say that's the case with a couple of these larger deals, the Montreal deal and the Dallas deal that we talked about, both had pretty long cycles, but we're pretty persistent. In terms of the timing of how something makes it into the bookings, that can also vary quite a bit. Some jurisdictions will start the process of acquiring a solution before they have it budgeted, knowing that it's a mission-critical solution and replacing it is somewhat nondiscretionary. So they may start the sales process or the buying process well in advance of that actually showing up in a budget and be prepared then when it's funded to sign a contract and move forward pretty quickly. Others may get it in a budget and then start a process or really accelerate a process. So it can take place in a variety of ways, but -- so the fact that new budgets are rising doesn't immediately result in sort of a flood of new pipeline activity that don't always perfectly match up.\nOperator: Next question is from Matthew VanVliet with BTIG. Your line is open.\nMatthew VanVliet: You mentioned on the professional services side and overall implementation. You were a little bit limited both from a headcount perspective and the ability to hire new headcount to add to that. Just curious in terms of how that's progressing, both through July and what expectations, how those have changed through the end of the year? And then secondarily, has this increased your appetite to look to external partners to help with some of at least the more straightforward implementations or some of the more blocking tackling components of the deployments?\nLynn Moore: Sure. Thanks, Matthew. And I guess I would just say that the labor market challenges that are out there, we talk about a lot of things in our business where we may be a little bit immune to some of the external macro factors. But the challenges in the labor market, we're not unique there. And so we've been experiencing this for some time. It has been a challenge, both in terms of hiring and recruiting, and we're also seeing it with a little bit higher early retirements and things like that. The impact is -- we're seeing it right now, and we've got a lot of business we want to execute on and deliver on, but our services revenues are off a little bit. And I'd probably expect some of that to carry through throughout the year. We do generally make sort of large hiring classes. You take, for example, our enterprise ERP group. They hired a very large class back in February. I think we're looking at hiring another very large class in the next few weeks. But even when you hire those large classes, it takes time for them to get up to speed and get to a point where they can go out and become fully billable on client implementation. So it can take four, five, six months. So there's a little bit of delay there. So there's a little bit of impact that will happen even as our margins as we bring these people on, but it takes a little time for them to start becoming billable. As it relates to external partners, I think historically, we've always wanted to keep our services in-house. It's certainly not a big margin advantage to have them in-house, but we think from a professional and competitive and client ownership advantage, it really has been -- has played out and been a lot of value to us really for the last 25 years. The thought of always having the touch point from initially from our sales, handing it off to our implementation team, handing it off to our support team, I think that client relationship and client experience is part of what drives our success in the market. And so as of right now, we're not really looking to do that. It's such a unique business that I think we just want to keep these things in-house, at least for the time being.\nMatthew VanVliet: Very, very helpful. And then as you look at the state hunting license agreements that NIC has in place, how do you feel you're progressing in terms of getting through any demand associated with those customers, making your way into, I guess, sort of the local level that roll up through those statewide purchasing agreements. You've captured a lot of the sort of low-hanging fruit that NIC just didn't have the product to sell through. Or are we still very early stages of the overall opportunity that those present for you?\nLynn Moore: Yes, Matthew. I think I made the comment on the last call that we're probably in the first inning of our -- what we can do with NIC and maybe even just the top of the first inning. I wouldn't say that -- they did -- the reality is they didn't really have some of the local relationships. We're still learning about each other. The fact that this soon, we've already done the number of deals that we've done, I think we've closed 15 deals already. Our active pipeline is around 100 deals, north of $30 million. That's pretty exciting in such a short period of time while we're still doing just our normal integrations with NIC. We've won some pretty significant contracts. I think, last quarter, we talked about VendEngine won a contract with the Arkansas Department of Corrections, mentioned in my comments earlier, another VendEngine contract with Kentucky, our Entellitrak Veterans Benefits contract with Utah. That's pretty exciting stuff, particularly with -- when I mentioned a deal between NIC and VendEngine and something I've said internally is these are both acquisitions that we've brought on in the last year and in different parts of the business and to see that coordination already and to be able to leverage the relationships that NIC has got those deep state relationships as well as those enterprise contracts, it's pretty exciting stuff.\nBrian Miller: And I'd just add that specifically on hunting and fishing, we're still integrating US eDirect with the NIC outdoor recreation platform, but really a significant increase in our capabilities there. But I'd say we're in the very early stages of being able to drive that down more broadly, both within local government and at the state and federal levels. But that is one of the product areas that on a combined basis, we've got a lot of strength in and that we're looking for big things out of...\nLynn Moore: I apologize, Matthew, if you're asking about hunting, I heard state, we call those understanding.\nMatthew VanVliet: No, I was talking about the NIC deals, those agreements. But thanks for the extra color, Brian. Appreciated guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Lynn, maybe just for you. Can you just talk a little bit about what product areas are having the most success in converting maintenance customers to SaaS? I know there were a lot more -- there was a lot more in TCV converted this year than -- or this quarter versus last -- Q2 of last year. Where do you feel like you're having that success? And then related to that, how do you think about that base moving over to SaaS in the coming years?\nLynn Moore: Yes, sure, Saket. Thanks for the question. It's a good question. I think right now, probably the primary areas where we're seeing the most flips is in our ERP side of the -- suite of the business. So both our enterprise ERP and our ERP Pro solutions. We had -- and coincidentally, those are the areas where we actually have the most customers. That's our largest customer base. I think at our top end, our enterprise ERP, we're already well ahead of our plan for the year in flips. We're about 35% ahead through the first half. The lower end in our ERP Pro solution, which is our formerly our Incode solution, we plan to do about 180 a year down in that product suite. We're obviously seeing it in other businesses, but that's probably our highest volume. And as we continue to move forward, you're going to see that increase not only there, but across all of our product suites. As we model out and look forward, we're starting to do some internal modeling around what we call Tyler 2030. And a big part of our growth strategy is converting that very high customer base from on-prem over into the SaaS world. I'm not prepared today to sort of give you a projection of how many per year and how much that's going to grow. But I would expect over the next five to seven years, you're going to continue to see momentum and increased movement in that area.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. That makes sense. Brian, maybe for you as a follow-up. And maybe this is related to some of the hiring commentary that you folks had mentioned on services. But can you just talk a little bit about software and services bookings? It's been a couple of strong quarters of bookings, strong on bookings than done on revenue, frankly. So can you just talk about what's driving that strength? And just maybe anything different this year about the conversion to revenue here versus prior years?\nBrian Miller: Well, I think on the second part of the question, the conversion to revenue is just that more of it is SaaS or -- and so you don't necessarily get a revenue hit. In fact, you typically don't get a revenue hit immediately. Often, it's a quarter or two after the signing before their environment stood up and we start to recognize revenues. So even with the SaaS customer, there's a lag. And then, of course, you've got a recurring revenue stream that you're starting to grow. So it may start in the third month of the quarter and so you get a month's worth of revenues, and the next quarter you get a quarter's worth and so forth. And so that ongoing change in the mix has been a part of that with less licenses, which are typically recognized mostly upfront. We talked about a little bit of the service pressure as well. So that also is with our -- a little bit below plan headcount there, we're, I think, not ramping up those new signings as quickly as we might once we're sort of fully staffed with our billable implementation teams. So I think that's the biggest thing. I think in terms of just driving higher bookings, we've always said bookings can be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, especially around those big deals. In this quarter, a couple of those big deals that did have long sales cycles got to contract. But generally, I'd say it's sort of a combination of those factors we pointed out, pretty strong economic backdrop in budget situation around governments. It's certainly aided by the ARPA funds, the federal stimulus that's available to them. As we've talked about on prior calls, sometimes it's not clearly identifiable that a deal was funded with ARPA funds. Sometimes it is, and there are some of those in this quarter. Other times ARPA funds are used for something else, but it frees up money that helps perhaps make an incremental purchase or an add-on sales. We're seeing real strength in our inside sales selling additional products to existing customers, and we believe some of that is driven by the federal stimulus. But as we've said in the past, that's sort of a long-term tailwind they've got until the end of 2024 really to commit those funds and through 2026 to spend those. And we saw a study by Brookings that indicated that at least as of the end of 2021, only about 40% of the stimulus funds had been committed yet by cities and counties. So we think there's sort of an ongoing tailwind there. So strength in the market and then our competitive position is really strong. I mean, we continue to invest at a high level. We've got multiple products that we've added through acquisitions and internal builds. So our average sales are often bigger than they would have been in the past because we've got more products that are bundled together, things like our data and insight solution that's often bundled in a new sale, a number of our public safety products that now are often in a new sale that make that bigger. So there are a number of factors contributing to that. But yes, there is typically a lag from bookings growth to revenue growth.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nMichael Turrin: There were several comments throughout the prepared remarks around the strength and resilience of the demand environment. Just wondering if there's any more color you can add around what you're seeing from public sector customers currently and how the RFP volumes you're referencing compare to what you're used to generally seeing this time of the year?\nLynn Moore: Yes, sure, Michael. I mean it's -- the last few years have been a little bit rocky with COVID and everything else. What we're seeing right now is really a return to pre-COVID levels generally across the board. Our RFPs are up, our demos are up and I'd say the market looks pretty strong. In some parts of our business, the pipeline is growing even beyond those levels. In some parts, it's sort of returned back to sort of pre-COVID levels. So right now, what we're seeing out there in the market, all the leading indicators is budgets are strong and healthy and the demand is there.\nMichael Turrin: That's helpful. Brian, you provided us with a lot of useful detail around segmentation and various splits of the business. In terms of where your focus lies, can you help level set what you view as the True North metric for top line or a couple of metrics as you're working through the transition? Is it backlog, the SaaS ARR metric or something else, I think it would be useful to hear you talk through just given the moving pieces of the model and the macro we're all working through here?\nBrian Miller: Yes. We recognize that our business is maybe a little bit more complicated given the transition from license to the cloud and the addition of NIC and their transaction-based revenue streams and our plans to grow what already is a pretty sizable payments business through NIC to grow that significantly. So we give a lot of metrics and we recognize you probably give too many metrics. But I'd say, if you're looking for kind of the North Star and what's really important is our model evolves, it would be those metrics around ARR and particularly, we do get the breakdown of those different components of ARR, but particularly software subscription ARR and transaction ARR. And we expect that maintenance will kind of flat right now, will start to decline as more of those customers flip to the cloud. So really, the things that probably the most important metric would be around those recurring ARs from subscriptions and transactions.\nOperator: The next question is from Joshua Reilly with Needham. Your line is open.\nJoshua Reilly: How should we think about the seasonality, if any, around the payments business now, including NIC, both from the portal revenues from core Tyler and NIC?\nBrian Miller: Yes. Typically, the fourth quarter is lighter there, less activity through the portals, less maybe slightly less in terms of payment volumes that are often associated with those portal transactions. So around the holidays and as people get to the end of the year, there's just a little bit lower activity there. The other thing that we talked about last quarter which is sort of new to us is in the Florida contract with the revenues around the payments for the Department of State and their corporate licensing activity, which is almost all in the first quarter, a little bit of it lags into the second quarter. And I think they were around $6 million of revenues associated with that that's seasonally towards the beginning of the year. But other than that, it's primarily a fourth quarter slowdown around the payments.\nJoshua Reilly: That's helpful.\nLynn Moore: I think too, Josh, was as we continue to grow that payments business and we were -- as you know, we're already growing it within Tyler and as you extend it beyond just some of the NIC things around outdoor activities and stuff. As we look out several years, I think you'll see that as the volume gets bigger and it's across a larger base and it's across using more products and more constituents, you'll see that, I think, over time, flatten out, but that will take some time.\nJoshua Reilly: Got it. And then just one other follow-up on the NIC business. What are you seeing in terms of the driver history record hold revenue that was from that segment? Is that recovering as you would have expected? And how much could that potentially positively impact revenue throughout the rest of the year?\nLynn Moore: Yes, I'd say the DHR right now, it's kind of on our internal plan for the year, which is really essentially sort of flat with very little growth. And I think that's one of the areas in our business when we talk about being recession resistant. It's an area where I think we're seeing a little bit of impact in the DHR business. At the same time, DHR used to be -- if you go back several years, it was a very big substantial piece of the NIC businesses as we're starting to grow these other streams. I'm expecting the impact of DHR and the percentage of that business to somewhat decrease within that business unit. I think right now, it's about 17% of their total revenues, maybe 19% outside of COVID, and I think that's trending towards maybe down in the 15% range as we're starting to grow some of these other state interactive government services revenues, payments revenues and some more products going through their systems.\nBrian Miller: Yes. So typically, this quarter, they were down about 2%. So they're recovering a bit, but still softness there. And that's one also that we believe is affected indirectly by supply chain and some of that's tied to new vehicle sales. And those are a broader economy. There's no cars out there.\nOperator: The next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Congrats on a really nice bookings quarter. Lynn, I was wondering could you just talk a little bit about what's your discussions like with customers today in terms of consolidating the number of vendors they're working with. I was just kind of curious you all obviously have a much more expansive product portfolio than you did 10 years ago. How much is the ability to sort of take wallet share a bigger part of the story today than it was say, 5, 10 years ago? And is that accelerating? Is that conversation accelerating? I'm just sort of wondering about thinking about you all more in sort of a net revenue retention basis, meaning the ability to expand sort of cross and upsell versus just be as reliant as you were on sort of net new, say, again, 5, 10 years ago?\nLynn Moore: Yes, sure, Kirk. Good question. I think part of our strategy has always been to have a comprehensive suite and compete that way and sell our products as a suite as opposed to single point solutions. I still think that's a significant competitive advantage. There are some consultants and things out there that are sometimes suggesting to go the other way. I'm not really quite sure why because having to do a bunch of extra integrations, trying to get multiple vendors, just seems to me to be more of a headache rather than going to a single vendor. And you're right. I think one of our help it takes decades to develop. And so when you look at cross-selling and upselling back into that base, that's also a big strategic driver for us going forward. Every quarter, the reports I'm seeing were -- our inside sales channels are continuing to outdo themselves each and every quarter. And as we continue to do tuck-in acquisitions and broaden our portfolio, I think you're going to continue to see that. And I do think it's one of our competitive advantages in the market.\nKirk Materne: And Brian, just on the ramp in sort of your services business and bring out more billable or more headcount on that side. How should we think about that sort of impacting margins as we think a little bit ahead to 23%. I realize you guys are expecting margins maybe start picking up again in '24, not next year. But is there anything we should be aware of, meaning maybe a little bit heavier weight on the first half of the year next year as people get ramped up versus the back half? Any just color on that would be helpful.\nBrian Miller: Yes. I think the margin impact is more of what we're seeing this year because you bring those people on, obviously, you're paying them there in your expenses, but it's maybe kind of a six months ramp-up to become fully billable. So initially, you get a margin hit from having the cost without the revenues associated with it. And then so from a negative impact, you will see that more this year. And then as they become billable and they're starting to generate revenues, and help us deliver that backlog, then you see a positive impact. Services aren't a high-margin business for us as it is. But -- so I would expect that as you get into the early part of next year through the middle of next year, you'll start to see a positive impact from those employees being productive. And we hired, as Linda, a pretty big class or classes cumulatively pretty large across Q2 and have pretty strong hiring plans in the second half of the year. So assuming we can execute on those and turnover seems to be settling down a bit. Then we'll have those resources billable in the first part of next year.\nOperator: The next question is from Charles Strauzer with CJS Securities. Your line is open.\nCharles Strauzer: Just picking up on that last question about the labor hiring looking at the gross margin on a percentage basis in Q2, it was down pretty significantly year-over-year and down a touch sequentially while SG&A was lower. Was that kind of the main driver behind that?\nLynn Moore: Yes. I think the margin, there's a combination of professional services is part of that, as I just described. We're certainly seeing as we talked about as we headed into the year with our guidance, a return of some of the, I'd say, COVID cost savings. Some of those are in the SG&A lines. Some of those are in cost of sales, particularly billable travel. So while we still currently and expect in the future to deliver a significant amount of services remotely as we did during COVID, there is billable travel returning across some segments of our business. And so that's having an impact from margins, which we expected. And then we've talked about some of the transaction cost, the bubble costs associated with our cloud transition and specifically with the move from our proprietary data centers to AWS. And so those things are generally in line with what we expected. We did have also a bit higher revenue stream from the COVID-related revenues at NIC. Those have typically a bit lower margin than Tyler's overall margin. So the sort of over-performance in those revenues had a negative margin impact. And as we've said, we expect those to -- the last of those to go away at the end in the third quarter. So that will be a positive from a margin perspective.\nCharles Strauzer: That's helpful. And just staying on the AWS transition there, where do you think you are in terms of the -- your expectations for that transition? And are you tracking ahead behind on schedule, that kind of thing.\nLynn Moore: Yes. I think, Charlie, we're on track with our internal plans, both in terms of where we are with our product investments, what we've outlined for plans to exit our data centers. And when we talk about sort of getting the other side of the bubble costs. So right now, internally, I'm pleased with where we're sitting.\nOperator: Next question is from Rob Oliver with Baird. Your line is open.\nRob Oliver: There hasn't been a lot of commentary on public safety on the call. So then I thought I'd ask about that. It was a bit of a focus in Indianapolis. And over the last couple of years, you guys certainly have begun to see some nice success in cross-sell of public safety into your core. So just curious to know how you characterize that market right now? And when you look at the components of that RFP activity and pipeline, how does public safety fare in their win rates and then how it sets up for that sort of all-important back half for the year in Q4?\nLynn Moore: Yes, sure, Rob. I appreciate that comment. I'd say public safety right now, the market has moved back to sort of pretty much back to normal. Our competitive landscape. I like our position. There's a couple of strong competitors. We've talked about them before. We've also know that there's some competitors out there that are in that space that are carrying a lot of debt, which I think are probably with the change in rates might be impacting their ability to execute. We've seen some reports on some smaller competitors who may be going through a little bit more difficult time and seen some layoffs and things like that. But right now, we're pretty pleased with where we sit. We made a big investment years ago into things like mobility. And that continues to be a significant competitive edge for us, along with, as you mentioned, leveraging a lot of these other acquisitions we've done in our Tyler Alliance story. I mentioned in my opening comments, the contract with Lima County, Ohio, which was principally -- we sold our Enterprise Courts & Justice product and some things on the C&J side, but also the public safety side and that Alliance story really resonated with the client. So we're starting to see good things there. The market is still, I think, somewhat resistant to the cloud, but we're starting to get some SaaS deals done. We're looking at potentially getting our first beta client in the AWS Cloud, maybe later this year or early next year. So there's some exciting things going on in that market.\nRob Oliver: Great. Okay. That's really good color. And then, Brian, just a quick one for you, just on the CapEx reduction, and I apologize if I missed it. If you could just talk a little bit about what the components were of that.\nBrian Miller: On the CapEx? Nothing really significant. It's just some tweaking of the timing of some of the things, particularly around our -- some of our facilities and NIC, for example, is moving into a new facility in the Kansas City area and the timing of some of those things has just shifted around a bit. So I don't think there's anything early notable in our CapEx right now relative to what we thought at the beginning of the year. A little bit minor changes too in our capitalization around some of our internal software development efforts, most of that being associated with the cloud optimization of some of our products. So sometimes there's a little bit of a difference of how we originally estimated it will fall in how the accounting rules ultimately end up with what we capitalize and what runs through expense.\nOperator: The next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Just maybe a few for me. It sounds -- a lot of this has been asked, but it sounds like the bookings were really strong this quarter. And particularly, if you adjust for the duration of the contracts, it's even better. What -- if you think about the headwind to SaaS revenues, particularly that you're seeing from that services hiring challenge that you talked about what would it be -- what would -- is it possible to know like where SaaS revenues would be if you didn't have that challenge? And then I've got a few more.\nBrian Miller: Yes, I'm not exactly sure how we would translate that. I think the lag in the start is pretty modest, but I think we would be seeing a little bit higher level, but I don't know that it's sort of a double-digit effect. I think it's pretty modest now. And like I said, we have pretty aggressive hiring plans for the rest of the year to get our teams up to full strength. And so I think it's a relatively short-term impact. We'll see how it plays out through the balance of the year. It could create some softness on that services side. But I think at this point, it's not a big impediment to growth in the subscription revenues, but certainly is some sort of a factor there.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. And then the other question is, I mean, with all the headlines around inflation and software companies raising price, can you remind us what are kind of the inflation adjustments or pricing vectors that you have in your model with customers. And particularly, I know that annual maintenance upticks are part of that. So as you see more customers converting to SaaS, how do you make sure that you continue to capture those unit economics on the subscription contracts -- on the SaaS contracts.\nLynn Moore: Yes, sure, Alex. So -- and you're right, most of our maintenance contracts are annual agreements. We do have a few multiyear ones. A small percentage of those have built-in escalators, but generally, most of them have the ability to adjust pricing on an annual basis. Some of those are tied to CPI, but I think that's probably not the majority. But there is some flexibility there. And we took a look at that this spring. Still a majority of our maintenance contracts are on the sort of the June 30, July 1 cycle, and it's something that we talked about internally back in March and April before we went out. As it relates to SaaS contracts, similar things. I mean we -- these are -- after you get through the initial engagement, you do have the ability to start putting in price increases. A lot of our initial SaaS deals are multiyear terms. Some of them are they may be built-in escalators, but the way the revenue recognition has worked historically is that we actually have been recognizing them on more of a flat rate. So there can be a little bit of a declining margin. It's one of the reasons why we've tried really hard to shorten the length of those initial contracts, but we're also looking at doing some things with contract terms so that we will be able to get those built-in escalators. We do price them in. So we're getting the cash in those agreements. And then as they roll off and we move into their annual renewals, we'll have the ability to change that pricing even more. But there are obviously some existing agreements that are out there that had pricing that was built in a year or two ago that we're -- we can't adjust at this point.\nBrian Miller: And in some of our products, we did implement sort of our above-normal maintenance increases this year. And we've also taken a look at our professional services billing rates and in some cases, adjustments there to account for inflation.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. And then I guess on the topic of cash in the door, if you actually look at your guys' model, every two years, your free cash flow seasonality in the first half jumps around. It goes from like 23% to 24% of the total year to 10% to 12% of the total year. So first of all, just help us understand the -- it looks like we're in one of those years where it could be more like the 20-plus percent year, but I just want to understand the seasonality from a free cash flow perspective as we look at the second half, specifically and the full year? And then just tie that in with capital allocation. You talked about wanting to pay down the debt, which makes perfect sense given the raising interest rate expenses and environment. But also maybe comment given where the stock is, given where the fundamentals are around your -- the possibility of an increased buyback.\nBrian Miller: I'll take the first part of that. Yes, the cash flow does -- typically the third quarter, and I think that's every year is the strongest quarter, primarily because of those maintenance billings. We have close to $470 million a year in maintenance. Not all of it, but the biggest chunk of that is renewed as of July 1. They typically build late in the second quarter and collected in the third quarter. Those they are typically don't age. So those are paid relatively promptly. So that drives that third quarter cash flow growth. I think some of -- there was a little bit of an anomaly last year in the second quarter around NIC shortly with -- because they were only in for part of the quarter. And there was some sort of unusual dynamics around the timing just when we acquired them, they happen to have a fair amount of, I guess, what I'd describe as customer cash that's sort of passing through that from their transaction-based revenue streams that was on their balance sheet that then was paid out, remitted on to the customers after acquisition. So it created sort of an anomaly there. This year, it's sort of the normal full quarter and NIC's cash flow is more consistent across the year given the transaction-based nature of most of their revenues. So I think you'll see that start to even out a little bit more. But I still think, yes, you probably see certainly more than half and more in the kind of 2/3 of our cash flow for the year in the second half of the year. But I think there was that sort of unusual situation last year.\nLynn Moore: Yes. And on the second question around use of cash, you're right. Our priority still is debt pay downs. But we're still actively looking at acquisitions. We're not -- it's not like we've closed the door. We're not answering calls. We've been actively looking. We've participated in a couple of processes this year. Obviously, we purchased USD Direct early in the year. But we need something compelling and something that's really at a reasonable valuation. What we've seen in the acquisition front, at least even recently, even as the broader markets have gone through a little bit of turbulence in the last few months. The expectations for some of these private companies has not changed. And in fact, in some cases, has almost exceeded. I mean if people pitch deals where they tell me that I need to be paying higher valuations than Tyler. And that's a little bit hard for me to understand. It's a bit of a head scratcher. Our debt right now is our blended rate is about -- after we make this payment this month. It will be about 2%. But that's really a function of the fact that we've paid so much debt down. when we first took out our debt, I think our convertible was about 34% of our total debt. After this payment this month. It will be more just over 50%. So as we continue to pay our term down, we won't be as impacted by interest rates as we look out over the next year, which is nice. As it relates to share repurchases, I think right now, I agree with you as I look out five years, seven years from now, the stock could look pretty attractive. But I think unless we're really wanting to do a significant move, I'd rather just pay down the debt in the near term.\nOperator: The next question is from Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nTerry Tillman: In Brian, I feel like I should follow the 10 because we're going past an hour, but I can't help myself since I have you, I'm going to ask a couple of questions. First, I do want to use some fringe because of the Montreal deal for Bongor I guess the first question just relates to -- we talked to one court system. They had a 25-year plus old case management system. I know you've talked about your high-end ERP business, your ERP Pro business and then somebody asked about -- Matt asked about public safety. How is case management opportunities right now in terms of how would that stack rank versus some of these other kind of cloud replacement opportunities? And then a quick.\nBrian Miller: Case management. Yes. Case Management is one of our most I'd say probably our most dominant products in the marketplace, probably one of our biggest market shares. So our enterprise case management formerly Odyssey is I think north of 55% of the courts in the U.S. use that solution. I think it's 8 of the 10 largest counties in the country something like 17 state-wide implementation. So it's a very strong product for us. But it also can be somewhat of a lumpy business, particularly with respect to those really big contracts because it is not unusual for us to see 20, think we've replaced a couple of 40-plus year old case management systems that were custom written in the 70s in some of these large counties. And so there's sort of some long-term activity in the backdrop. We see more of the kind of mid-range deals that are more currently active in the pipeline, but I don't think there are any big statewide deals that are sort of currently actively in the market. But we do have a very high success rate as those come along. And then as we've been able to build on that really very strong position we have in the case management space, where most of our growth in courts is coming from now is from those products that we have in that suite around it. So we mentioned on the call today, one of our bigger deals, Dallas County. Dallas County has been a long time. It's a top 10 county been a longtime case management customer -- but now we were able to add our jail solution to the products that they use. So building on that relationship, and we've done a number of acquisitions in that space, probation, jury, prosecutor, process service solutions that broaden our offerings there and enable us to grow there. But I'd say it's certainly a solid business, and we still have a very strong competitive position. But right now, not as much new activity. But as it comes along, we're well positioned.\nLynn Moore: Yes. And just to add to that, Jonathan, that last point that Brian said, I think is worth emphasizing. Using -- leveraging our strong position in -- it's still an anchor. It's still the gateway and the ability to take some of these other investments we've done, whether it's around corrections like the Dallas County Jail deal, but even supervision, if you remember a few years ago, I think it was about four years ago, we did an acquisition of a company called CaseloadPRO. And we won this -- we signed this in Q2, L.A. County, for enterprise supervision, supervision. That's pre trial. We talked about the different areas and even in supervision, whether it's juvenile adult and things like that. And we think we're going to be adding those additional solutions to L.A. County, which is the largest coronal justice departments and counties in the United States. So.\nTerry Tillman: That's great. Congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: The next question is from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is open.\nJonathan Ho: I'll keep it to one question. With the upcoming quarter, can you remind us of whether there are any large deals in terms of maybe some tougher bookings comparisons? SP1.\nBrian Miller: A second. Yes. Last year, in Q3, we didn't really have any mega deals. Our biggest SaaS deal was about a $5 million contract value with Lawrence, Kansas, and we had a handful of license deals, the biggest of which was less than $3 million. So I think it's a pretty normal comp coming up.\nOperator: The next question is from Keith Housum with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Housum: I'll keep mine to one question while I know we're running late here. Brian, maybe you just touch on the NIC acquisition, your ability to retain employees over the past year and how that affects the business going forward.\nBrian Miller: Yes, it's been really solid, both at the senior management level and the staff level I think we've had very solid retention, I think, for all the reasons that the acquisition made a ton of sense created great opportunities for growth at NIC as well as Tyler. And I think their teams have recognized that. I think it's been -- as we look back over the last year, a smooth integration for a deal of that size, particularly one that was completed while we were still almost all remote during COVID. We've got some new, not new to NIC, but people in new senior leadership roles there, particularly Lizabeth the President and Thomas, the COO and they've done a great job of managing that team and working with the integration. So I think we're very happy with the retention and the opportunities that it's created across NIC and Tyler. Their payments team, for example, our Tyler Payments team has joined with the NIC Payments team, and they've taken the leadership there. So yes, we're really pleased with the retention there.\nLynn Moore: Yes. I think the excitement that we see in the cross opportunities and the things that we can do together, that just naturally flows up and down the organization, and I think that helps with retention.\nOperator: Our final question is from Clarke Jeffries with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nClarke Jeffries: I'll keep it brief. I just wanted to get a sense of what your rough range of organic or core growth expectations are for NIC, the considerations in terms of how the revenues are being driven today and sort of how the macro is impacting that. So from the 8% today, what's the general range you expect going forward?\nBrian Miller: Yes. I mean historically, NIC was about an 8% grower on average, looking back over several years, sort of pre-covid around the, what they call, state growth. So sort of a proxy for organic growth. And so that, I think, is sort of our baseline. We've seen pretty strong growth over the last couple of years with all the shift towards citizens and businesses doing more business with government digitally and so higher transaction volumes. So they're really growing off of this 8% growth, we think, is really pretty impressive this quarter, given that it's off of a very strong base that was established over the last couple of years. But I'd say that's kind of the baseline and that as we continue to drive more cross-selling and so more opportunities particularly in the payment space. And through things like the USC Direct acquisition, which is now a part of NIC, that there's certainly an opportunity to move up into the even into the low double-digit range. But for right now, I think this 8% is kind of a good baseline and all of our initiatives around the combination with Tyler should ultimately drive that higher?\nLynn Moore: Yes. I think, Clarke, obviously, taking out the near-term growth headwind of COVID, which I assume that, that was part of your -- you've taken that out. But as we go forward, it's like a lot of acquisitions. I mean they're a big stand-alone division within Tyler. But to Brian's point, a lot of the cross-sell opportunities whether or not internally, we recognize those on a different division P&L versus NIC's P&L. I think as you go over time, we don't really report on specific organic growth within our business units. And you'll see some of that just the opportunities are there. And as payments grows, some of that payments business may go to our ERP because it's going to their client base, but I see played a significant hand just like the vend engine deal in Arkansas, Kentucky, that revenue really doesn't happen without NIC yet it's sitting on the books over in our Courts & Justice division. So I think as we go forward, you'll probably see us less comment on their specific revenues and growth as they just become more integrated with NIC. We've kind of thought it was appropriate, really for the first year or so, but it will be like the rest of our other divisions because there's so much as we talked about, a lot of our opportunities are through cross-sells and how we leverage each other. And so to us, at one point, it just becomes all Tyler.\nOperator: At this time, there proves to be no more questions. Mr. Moore, I'll turn the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nLynn Moore: Okay. Great. Thanks, Chris, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any more questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2022. In our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab, schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $468.7 million, up 16%, including NIC and our other acquisitions from the last 12 months. Organic revenue growth, excluding COVID-related revenues was 6.2% on a GAAP basis and 5.8% on a non-GAAP basis. NIC's COVID-related revenues for the quarter exceeded our expectations at $15.2 million. Revenues from the TourHealth initiatives concluded in the second quarter and the Virginia rent relief program is expected to be completed in the third quarter with about $8 million of revenues anticipated in the quarter. As expected, license revenues declined 14.7% as our new software contract mix continued to shift to SaaS. Software revenues rose 18.3% -- service revenues rose 18.3% but on an organic basis were essentially flat with last year. Services revenues were impacted by delays in hiring new professional services staff in the current labor market. While we hired a large class of implementers during the quarter, there is an onboarding period of several months before they will be fully billable. We intend to continue to grow our implementation team during the second half of the year to support delivery of our growing backlog and pipeline, but we'll likely continue to see some pressure on services revenues in the short term as those teams ramp up. Subscription revenues rose 28.2% with strong organic growth of 14.1%. We added 167 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a new high of 96 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $115 million in total contract value. In Q2 of last year, we added 170 new subscription-based arrangements and had 62 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $73 million in total contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the second quarter added $27.6 million in new ARR. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 74% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 65% in Q2 of last year. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.7 years compared to 4.1 years last year. Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $154.4 million, up 29.1%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 17.5%. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $18.5 million, up 14%. For the second quarter, our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $1.49 billion, up 16.3%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was approximately $405.6 million, up 24.9%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $617.7 million, up 29.1% and non-GAAP maintenance ARR was down 2.3% at approximately $467.3 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was a new high of $1.85 billion, up 13.9%. Bookings in the quarter were very strong at approximately $562 million, up 21%, including transaction-based revenues. On an organic basis, bookings were also quite robust at approximately $423 million, up 16.3%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $2 billion, up 53.2% on an organic basis were approximately $1.5 billion up 21.1%. If our weighted average contract terms for new SaaS contracts had been the same as last year, organic bookings growth would have been 18.3%. As Lynn mentioned earlier, both cash flows from operations and free cash flow reached new highs for a second quarter. Cash flows from operations were $76.7 million and free cash flow rose to $60 million from negative $33.5 million last year. We continue to strengthen our already solid balance sheet. During the quarter, we repaid $60 million of our term debt. And since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $475 million of term debt. We will also pay down an additional $100 million in term debt at the end of this month. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.275 billion and cash and investments of $314 million. As a reminder, $600 million of our debt is in the form of convertible debt with an interest rate of 0.25% and the remainder is in prepayable term debt due in 2024 and 2026. We also have an undrawn $500 million revolver. Our net leverage at June 30 was approximately 2.07x trailing 12 months pro forma EBITDA and our leverage should be under 2x at the end of July. Interest rate hikes thus far this year and projected for the remainder of the year have resulted in significantly higher projected interest expense for the year than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. In addition, we have debt discounts and issuance costs related to our term debt that are being amortized as noncash interest expense. And as we prepay term debt, we are required to accelerate the amortization of those costs. Accordingly, we have adjusted our earnings guidance for the full year to reflect those changes in assumptions around interest. Our current guidance for the full year interest expense of $30 million represents an increase of about $7 million or approximately $0.12 per share for both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS compared to our previous guidance. The $7 million increase includes about $4 million of cash interest on term debt and $3 million of additional noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. It's important to note that our revenue guidance has not changed, and our expectations for operating margins are generally consistent with our previous outlook. Our updated 2022 guidance is as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.835 billion and $1.870 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 9%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $44 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and pandemic rent relief services. Revenues from TourHealth concluded in the second quarter, while revenues from the rent relief program are expected to wind down in the third quarter. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.60 and $3.76 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.36 and $7.52. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $30 million, including approximately $7.5 million of noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn. And I'd just add a couple of things. Clearly, on the larger contracts, typically do have a longer sales cycle and some of these very large ones, sales cycles can be sometimes measured in years from the time we start talking to someone about a solution and the timing of when those actually show up in a signed contract can be somewhat unpredictable. And I'd say that's the case with a couple of these larger deals, the Montreal deal and the Dallas deal that we talked about, both had pretty long cycles, but we're pretty persistent. In terms of the timing of how something makes it into the bookings, that can also vary quite a bit. Some jurisdictions will start the process of acquiring a solution before they have it budgeted, knowing that it's a mission-critical solution and replacing it is somewhat nondiscretionary. So they may start the sales process or the buying process well in advance of that actually showing up in a budget and be prepared then when it's funded to sign a contract and move forward pretty quickly. Others may get it in a budget and then start a process or really accelerate a process. So it can take place in a variety of ways, but -- so the fact that new budgets are rising doesn't immediately result in sort of a flood of new pipeline activity that don't always perfectly match up. And I'd just add that specifically on hunting and fishing, we're still integrating US eDirect with the NIC outdoor recreation platform, but really a significant increase in our capabilities there. But I'd say we're in the very early stages of being able to drive that down more broadly, both within local government and at the state and federal levels. But that is one of the product areas that on a combined basis, we've got a lot of strength in and that we're looking for big things out of... Well, I think on the second part of the question, the conversion to revenue is just that more of it is SaaS or -- and so you don't necessarily get a revenue hit. In fact, you typically don't get a revenue hit immediately. Often, it's a quarter or two after the signing before their environment stood up and we start to recognize revenues. So even with the SaaS customer, there's a lag. And then, of course, you've got a recurring revenue stream that you're starting to grow. So it may start in the third month of the quarter and so you get a month's worth of revenues, and the next quarter you get a quarter's worth and so forth. And so that ongoing change in the mix has been a part of that with less licenses, which are typically recognized mostly upfront. We talked about a little bit of the service pressure as well. So that also is with our -- a little bit below plan headcount there, we're, I think, not ramping up those new signings as quickly as we might once we're sort of fully staffed with our billable implementation teams. So I think that's the biggest thing. I think in terms of just driving higher bookings, we've always said bookings can be somewhat lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, especially around those big deals. In this quarter, a couple of those big deals that did have long sales cycles got to contract. But generally, I'd say it's sort of a combination of those factors we pointed out, pretty strong economic backdrop in budget situation around governments. It's certainly aided by the ARPA funds, the federal stimulus that's available to them. As we've talked about on prior calls, sometimes it's not clearly identifiable that a deal was funded with ARPA funds. Sometimes it is, and there are some of those in this quarter. Other times ARPA funds are used for something else, but it frees up money that helps perhaps make an incremental purchase or an add-on sales. We're seeing real strength in our inside sales selling additional products to existing customers, and we believe some of that is driven by the federal stimulus. But as we've said in the past, that's sort of a long-term tailwind they've got until the end of 2024 really to commit those funds and through 2026 to spend those. And we saw a study by Brookings that indicated that at least as of the end of 2021, only about 40% of the stimulus funds had been committed yet by cities and counties. So we think there's sort of an ongoing tailwind there. So strength in the market and then our competitive position is really strong. I mean, we continue to invest at a high level. We've got multiple products that we've added through acquisitions and internal builds. So our average sales are often bigger than they would have been in the past because we've got more products that are bundled together, things like our data and insight solution that's often bundled in a new sale, a number of our public safety products that now are often in a new sale that make that bigger. So there are a number of factors contributing to that. But yes, there is typically a lag from bookings growth to revenue growth. Yes. We recognize that our business is maybe a little bit more complicated given the transition from license to the cloud and the addition of NIC and their transaction-based revenue streams and our plans to grow what already is a pretty sizable payments business through NIC to grow that significantly. So we give a lot of metrics and we recognize you probably give too many metrics. But I'd say, if you're looking for kind of the North Star and what's really important is our model evolves, it would be those metrics around ARR and particularly, we do get the breakdown of those different components of ARR, but particularly software subscription ARR and transaction ARR. And we expect that maintenance will kind of flat right now, will start to decline as more of those customers flip to the cloud. So really, the things that probably the most important metric would be around those recurring ARs from subscriptions and transactions. Yes. Typically, the fourth quarter is lighter there, less activity through the portals, less maybe slightly less in terms of payment volumes that are often associated with those portal transactions. So around the holidays and as people get to the end of the year, there's just a little bit lower activity there. The other thing that we talked about last quarter which is sort of new to us is in the Florida contract with the revenues around the payments for the Department of State and their corporate licensing activity, which is almost all in the first quarter, a little bit of it lags into the second quarter. And I think they were around $6 million of revenues associated with that that's seasonally towards the beginning of the year. But other than that, it's primarily a fourth quarter slowdown around the payments. Yes. So typically, this quarter, they were down about 2%. So they're recovering a bit, but still softness there. And that's one also that we believe is affected indirectly by supply chain and some of that's tied to new vehicle sales. And those are a broader economy. There's no cars out there. Yes. I think the margin impact is more of what we're seeing this year because you bring those people on, obviously, you're paying them there in your expenses, but it's maybe kind of a six months ramp-up to become fully billable. So initially, you get a margin hit from having the cost without the revenues associated with it. And then so from a negative impact, you will see that more this year. And then as they become billable and they're starting to generate revenues, and help us deliver that backlog, then you see a positive impact. Services aren't a high-margin business for us as it is. But -- so I would expect that as you get into the early part of next year through the middle of next year, you'll start to see a positive impact from those employees being productive. And we hired, as Linda, a pretty big class or classes cumulatively pretty large across Q2 and have pretty strong hiring plans in the second half of the year. So assuming we can execute on those and turnover seems to be settling down a bit. Then we'll have those resources billable in the first part of next year. On the CapEx? Nothing really significant. It's just some tweaking of the timing of some of the things, particularly around our -- some of our facilities and NIC, for example, is moving into a new facility in the Kansas City area and the timing of some of those things has just shifted around a bit. So I don't think there's anything early notable in our CapEx right now relative to what we thought at the beginning of the year. A little bit minor changes too in our capitalization around some of our internal software development efforts, most of that being associated with the cloud optimization of some of our products. So sometimes there's a little bit of a difference of how we originally estimated it will fall in how the accounting rules ultimately end up with what we capitalize and what runs through expense. Yes, I'm not exactly sure how we would translate that. I think the lag in the start is pretty modest, but I think we would be seeing a little bit higher level, but I don't know that it's sort of a double-digit effect. I think it's pretty modest now. And like I said, we have pretty aggressive hiring plans for the rest of the year to get our teams up to full strength. And so I think it's a relatively short-term impact. We'll see how it plays out through the balance of the year. It could create some softness on that services side. But I think at this point, it's not a big impediment to growth in the subscription revenues, but certainly is some sort of a factor there. And in some of our products, we did implement sort of our above-normal maintenance increases this year. And we've also taken a look at our professional services billing rates and in some cases, adjustments there to account for inflation. I'll take the first part of that. Yes, the cash flow does -- typically the third quarter, and I think that's every year is the strongest quarter, primarily because of those maintenance billings. We have close to $470 million a year in maintenance. Not all of it, but the biggest chunk of that is renewed as of July 1. They typically build late in the second quarter and collected in the third quarter. Those they are typically don't age. So those are paid relatively promptly. So that drives that third quarter cash flow growth. I think some of -- there was a little bit of an anomaly last year in the second quarter around NIC shortly with -- because they were only in for part of the quarter. And there was some sort of unusual dynamics around the timing just when we acquired them, they happen to have a fair amount of, I guess, what I'd describe as customer cash that's sort of passing through that from their transaction-based revenue streams that was on their balance sheet that then was paid out, remitted on to the customers after acquisition. So it created sort of an anomaly there. This year, it's sort of the normal full quarter and NIC's cash flow is more consistent across the year given the transaction-based nature of most of their revenues. So I think you'll see that start to even out a little bit more. But I still think, yes, you probably see certainly more than half and more in the kind of 2/3 of our cash flow for the year in the second half of the year. But I think there was that sort of unusual situation last year. Case management. Yes. Case Management is one of our most I'd say probably our most dominant products in the marketplace, probably one of our biggest market shares. So our enterprise case management formerly Odyssey is I think north of 55% of the courts in the U.S. use that solution. I think it's 8 of the 10 largest counties in the country something like 17 state-wide implementation. So it's a very strong product for us. But it also can be somewhat of a lumpy business, particularly with respect to those really big contracts because it is not unusual for us to see 20, think we've replaced a couple of 40-plus year old case management systems that were custom written in the 70s in some of these large counties. And so there's sort of some long-term activity in the backdrop. We see more of the kind of mid-range deals that are more currently active in the pipeline, but I don't think there are any big statewide deals that are sort of currently actively in the market. But we do have a very high success rate as those come along. And then as we've been able to build on that really very strong position we have in the case management space, where most of our growth in courts is coming from now is from those products that we have in that suite around it. So we mentioned on the call today, one of our bigger deals, Dallas County. Dallas County has been a long time. It's a top 10 county been a longtime case management customer -- but now we were able to add our jail solution to the products that they use. So building on that relationship, and we've done a number of acquisitions in that space, probation, jury, prosecutor, process service solutions that broaden our offerings there and enable us to grow there. But I'd say it's certainly a solid business, and we still have a very strong competitive position. But right now, not as much new activity. But as it comes along, we're well positioned. A second. Yes. Last year, in Q3, we didn't really have any mega deals. Our biggest SaaS deal was about a $5 million contract value with Lawrence, Kansas, and we had a handful of license deals, the biggest of which was less than $3 million. So I think it's a pretty normal comp coming up. Yes, it's been really solid, both at the senior management level and the staff level I think we've had very solid retention, I think, for all the reasons that the acquisition made a ton of sense created great opportunities for growth at NIC as well as Tyler. And I think their teams have recognized that. I think it's been -- as we look back over the last year, a smooth integration for a deal of that size, particularly one that was completed while we were still almost all remote during COVID. We've got some new, not new to NIC, but people in new senior leadership roles there, particularly Lizabeth the President and Thomas, the COO and they've done a great job of managing that team and working with the integration. So I think we're very happy with the retention and the opportunities that it's created across NIC and Tyler. Their payments team, for example, our Tyler Payments team has joined with the NIC Payments team, and they've taken the leadership there. So yes, we're really pleased with the retention there. Yes. I mean historically, NIC was about an 8% grower on average, looking back over several years, sort of pre-covid around the, what they call, state growth. So sort of a proxy for organic growth. And so that, I think, is sort of our baseline. We've seen pretty strong growth over the last couple of years with all the shift towards citizens and businesses doing more business with government digitally and so higher transaction volumes. So they're really growing off of this 8% growth, we think, is really pretty impressive this quarter, given that it's off of a very strong base that was established over the last couple of years. But I'd say that's kind of the baseline and that as we continue to drive more cross-selling and so more opportunities particularly in the payment space. And through things like the USC Direct acquisition, which is now a part of NIC, that there's certainly an opportunity to move up into the even into the low double-digit range. But for right now, I think this 8% is kind of a good baseline and all of our initiatives around the combination with Tyler should ultimately drive that higher?"

            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and welcome to our call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, I'll have some comments on our quarter, and then Brian will review the details of our results. I'll end with some additional comments, and then we'll take questions. Brian? Thanks, Brian. We're pleased with our second quarter results as the public sector market environment remains strong and RFP and demo activities continue to trend positively. We leveraged successful multi-suite wins and cross-selling efforts to deliver a solid quarter, and our strong competitive position, coupled with an active public sector market, drove a 21% increase in bookings. Overall, we see the challenging broader macro environment as an opportunity to support our clients by replacing aging mission-critical systems and adding advanced digital services to serve the public more efficiently. Total revenues grew approximately 16% with organic growth of 6.2%. Services revenues were flat on an organic basis, exhibiting some softness due to labor market challenges affecting our hiring of implementation resources. Recurring revenues comprised 79.5% of our quarterly revenues and were led by 28% growth in subscription revenues. On an organic basis, excluding COVID-related revenues, subscription revenues grew 14%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth in transaction-based revenues. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 58 of the last 66 quarters. We achieved solid revenue growth even as the shift in new software contract mix accelerates to SaaS from licenses. In Q2, 74% of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 65% in Q2 last year. As expected, margins compressed, reflecting the increase in our SaaS new business mix and the associated decline in license revenues as well as costs related to the cloud transition. Along with bookings performance, cash flow was a high point of the quarter as both cash flows from operations and free cash flow achieved new highs for a second quarter. April 21 marked the first anniversary of our NIC acquisition, and we continue to be excited about their performance and the growing pipeline of joint opportunities for both Tyler and NIC. NIC's core organic revenue growth was 8%. During the second quarter, we successfully extended our enterprise contracts in West Virginia, Vermont, Kansas and Kentucky. NIC also signed our largest ARR contract for the quarter, a new four-year arrangement with the state of New Jersey for digital motor vehicle titling solution, which we estimate will generate transaction-based revenues of approximately $5 million per year. In addition, NIC signed a new SaaS agreement for our cannabis solution with the states of Alabama and Illinois, which are both state enterprise clients. We continue to build momentum with our joint and cross-sell opportunities with NIC. Our active cross-sell pipeline doubled in value from Q1, and we closed three new deals with NIC clients, including the state of Utah for our Entellitrak Veterans Benefit System and the state of Kentucky for our VendEngine Resident Resources Solution. In other Tyler divisions, we signed four additional notable SaaS deals, each for different product suites and each with a total contract value greater than $3.8 million. Those include Maricopa County, Arizona, for our enterprise permitting and licensing solution; Lancaster, California for our enterprise ERP solution; Lima, Ohio for our enterprise justice and supervision solutions as well as our full suite of public safety applications; and Orange County, Florida for our enterprise assessment and tax solution. In addition, we signed six SaaS deals in the quarter with contract values between $2 million and $3 million each and 14 SaaS deals with contract values between $1 million and $2 million each. During the second quarter, we also amended our e-filing agreement with the state of Washington from a transaction-based volume arrangement to a fixed fee contract. The deal spans nine years for approximately $27 million. However, due to certain contract terms, the majority of this contract was not included in backlog or bookings this quarter. The deal adds approximately $2.8 million in ARR, expanding to over $3 million in ARR in the latter half of the agreement. Our largest new software contract in the quarter was a license deal with Montreal, Quebec for our enterprise assessment and tax solution valued at approximately $13 million. We also signed a second deal in Canada for the same solution with the Yukon territory worth approximately $2 million. In addition, we signed a significant license deal with Dallas County, Texas for our enterprise correction solution valued at approximately $4.5 million. Dallas County, which currently uses our enterprise case management solution, has the ninth largest jail system in the U.S., making it our largest jail client. Other significant license arrangements signed in the quarter, each with a total contract value of greater than $1 million include Charlotte County, Florida and Huntington Park, California for enterprise ERP solution; Fort Worth, Texas for our enforcement mobile solution; and Owasso, Oklahoma for our enterprise public safety, enforcement mobile and data and insight solutions. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2022. Thanks, Brian. Against the backdrop of generally strong public sector budgets supplemented by federal stimulus funds, we're experiencing a very active market. With our leading competitive position and ongoing investments in strategic initiatives, we are well positioned to take advantage of the continued strength in our market. The acquisitions we've made over the last 18 months, including NIC, VendEngine and US eDirect, are performing well and contributing to our strong competitive position, helping us create more cross-sell and upsell opportunities with both new and existing clients. In particular, our enthusiasm around the cross-sell opportunities through NIC continues to grow, with recent wins across multiple Tyler products and a rapidly growing pipeline of opportunities. We're also pleased with our progress around our combined payments business. as we begin to execute our go-to-market strategy to pursue a tremendous public sector payments TAM. We believe Tyler is uniquely qualified to deliver government-focused payment solutions, leveraging the strength of NIC's payment platform, analytics and reporting and deep domain expertise together with Tyler's broad software portfolio and extensive client base, and we look forward to reporting our progress in the coming quarters. Even as we face an uncertain economic macro environment with rising inflation and interest rates, we have a great deal of confidence in our ability to continue to generate solid financial results and to grow cash flow. There are a number of factors that make Tyler's business resilient and relatively defensive compared to many software peers. The public sector market is more stable than many segments of the private sector. We provide solutions that power essential government services often replacing mission-critical systems that are end of life, and our clients don't go out of business or get acquired. Recurring revenues comprised approximately 80% and growing of our total revenues, generating highly reliable cash flow. In addition, the public sector is increasingly focused on moving into the cloud, which we support with our cloud-first model. Our experience during the recession more than a decade ago supports our confidence and Tyler is clearly in a much stronger position today to succeed during an economic downturn. We also have the advantage of a very strong balance sheet and reliable cash flow, which enables us to continue to invest strategically in growth even if some competitors may be constrained. While we have term and convertible debt associated with the NIC acquisition and have been impacted by rising interest rates, we are modestly leveraged at approximately 2x adjusted EBITDA, and we expect to continue to delever. Accordingly, in the near term, we are prioritizing using our cash flow to reduce debt while retaining the flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments that provide long-term value. Finally, I'm happy to report that we remain on track with our major strategic initiatives, including projects related to optimizing our products for efficient deployment of the cloud, moving from our proprietary data centers to AWS, and ultimately accelerating the migration of our on-premise clients to the cloud and driving long-term margin expansion. With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A. Yes, sure, Sami, it's Lynn. I'll start and I'll let Brian jump in. I think right now, our sales cycles are pretty normal. I think we've experienced times if you go back to the recession in '08, '09, that's where you started seeing things push out and get delayed. We saw a little bit of that during COVID. But I think the key is we continually talk about the fact that what we provide is essential functionality and the software that we do provide are things that are needed and they're often replacing out of date or systems. And so right now, the market looks good. The sales cycles are pretty typical for a normal healthy time, even with respect to those large deals. Sales cycles will vary a little bit across our different divisions. Some have longer than others. And sometimes the larger deals do take a little bit longer. But I think across the board, across our different product suites, I'd say sales cycles are pretty much on track. When you talk about state and local government spending environment, what we're seeing right now really is it's pretty healthy. I agree their budgets are in good shape. I've made comments before that I think coming out of COVID, they were not hit nearly as hard as a lot of people anticipated some of the journal reports and other things that we've read. Also with the infusion of some stimulus. And I know Brian's got some numbers and thoughts around ARPA. But I think right now, what we're seeing in our pipeline, all our leading indicators around RFPs and demos, things like that, you're seeing it a little bit in some of our bookings this quarter is that things are well right now in the state and local government. Sure. Thanks, Matthew. And I guess I would just say that the labor market challenges that are out there, we talk about a lot of things in our business where we may be a little bit immune to some of the external macro factors. But the challenges in the labor market, we're not unique there. And so we've been experiencing this for some time. It has been a challenge, both in terms of hiring and recruiting, and we're also seeing it with a little bit higher early retirements and things like that. The impact is -- we're seeing it right now, and we've got a lot of business we want to execute on and deliver on, but our services revenues are off a little bit. And I'd probably expect some of that to carry through throughout the year. We do generally make sort of large hiring classes. You take, for example, our enterprise ERP group. They hired a very large class back in February. I think we're looking at hiring another very large class in the next few weeks. But even when you hire those large classes, it takes time for them to get up to speed and get to a point where they can go out and become fully billable on client implementation. So it can take four, five, six months. So there's a little bit of delay there. So there's a little bit of impact that will happen even as our margins as we bring these people on, but it takes a little time for them to start becoming billable. As it relates to external partners, I think historically, we've always wanted to keep our services in-house. It's certainly not a big margin advantage to have them in-house, but we think from a professional and competitive and client ownership advantage, it really has been -- has played out and been a lot of value to us really for the last 25 years. The thought of always having the touch point from initially from our sales, handing it off to our implementation team, handing it off to our support team, I think that client relationship and client experience is part of what drives our success in the market. And so as of right now, we're not really looking to do that. It's such a unique business that I think we just want to keep these things in-house, at least for the time being. Yes, Matthew. I think I made the comment on the last call that we're probably in the first inning of our -- what we can do with NIC and maybe even just the top of the first inning. I wouldn't say that -- they did -- the reality is they didn't really have some of the local relationships. We're still learning about each other. The fact that this soon, we've already done the number of deals that we've done, I think we've closed 15 deals already. Our active pipeline is around 100 deals, north of $30 million. That's pretty exciting in such a short period of time while we're still doing just our normal integrations with NIC. We've won some pretty significant contracts. I think, last quarter, we talked about VendEngine won a contract with the Arkansas Department of Corrections, mentioned in my comments earlier, another VendEngine contract with Kentucky, our Entellitrak Veterans Benefits contract with Utah. That's pretty exciting stuff, particularly with -- when I mentioned a deal between NIC and VendEngine and something I've said internally is these are both acquisitions that we've brought on in the last year and in different parts of the business and to see that coordination already and to be able to leverage the relationships that NIC has got those deep state relationships as well as those enterprise contracts, it's pretty exciting stuff. I apologize, Matthew, if you're asking about hunting, I heard state, we call those understanding. Yes, sure, Saket. Thanks for the question. It's a good question. I think right now, probably the primary areas where we're seeing the most flips is in our ERP side of the -- suite of the business. So both our enterprise ERP and our ERP Pro solutions. We had -- and coincidentally, those are the areas where we actually have the most customers. That's our largest customer base. I think at our top end, our enterprise ERP, we're already well ahead of our plan for the year in flips. We're about 35% ahead through the first half. The lower end in our ERP Pro solution, which is our formerly our Incode solution, we plan to do about 180 a year down in that product suite. We're obviously seeing it in other businesses, but that's probably our highest volume. And as we continue to move forward, you're going to see that increase not only there, but across all of our product suites. As we model out and look forward, we're starting to do some internal modeling around what we call Tyler 2030. And a big part of our growth strategy is converting that very high customer base from on-prem over into the SaaS world. I'm not prepared today to sort of give you a projection of how many per year and how much that's going to grow. But I would expect over the next five to seven years, you're going to continue to see momentum and increased movement in that area. Yes, sure, Michael. I mean it's -- the last few years have been a little bit rocky with COVID and everything else. What we're seeing right now is really a return to pre-COVID levels generally across the board. Our RFPs are up, our demos are up and I'd say the market looks pretty strong. In some parts of our business, the pipeline is growing even beyond those levels. In some parts, it's sort of returned back to sort of pre-COVID levels. So right now, what we're seeing out there in the market, all the leading indicators is budgets are strong and healthy and the demand is there. I think too, Josh, was as we continue to grow that payments business and we were -- as you know, we're already growing it within Tyler and as you extend it beyond just some of the NIC things around outdoor activities and stuff. As we look out several years, I think you'll see that as the volume gets bigger and it's across a larger base and it's across using more products and more constituents, you'll see that, I think, over time, flatten out, but that will take some time. Yes, I'd say the DHR right now, it's kind of on our internal plan for the year, which is really essentially sort of flat with very little growth. And I think that's one of the areas in our business when we talk about being recession resistant. It's an area where I think we're seeing a little bit of impact in the DHR business. At the same time, DHR used to be -- if you go back several years, it was a very big substantial piece of the NIC businesses as we're starting to grow these other streams. I'm expecting the impact of DHR and the percentage of that business to somewhat decrease within that business unit. I think right now, it's about 17% of their total revenues, maybe 19% outside of COVID, and I think that's trending towards maybe down in the 15% range as we're starting to grow some of these other state interactive government services revenues, payments revenues and some more products going through their systems. Yes, sure, Kirk. Good question. I think part of our strategy has always been to have a comprehensive suite and compete that way and sell our products as a suite as opposed to single point solutions. I still think that's a significant competitive advantage. There are some consultants and things out there that are sometimes suggesting to go the other way. I'm not really quite sure why because having to do a bunch of extra integrations, trying to get multiple vendors, just seems to me to be more of a headache rather than going to a single vendor. And you're right. I think one of our help it takes decades to develop. And so when you look at cross-selling and upselling back into that base, that's also a big strategic driver for us going forward. Every quarter, the reports I'm seeing were -- our inside sales channels are continuing to outdo themselves each and every quarter. And as we continue to do tuck-in acquisitions and broaden our portfolio, I think you're going to continue to see that. And I do think it's one of our competitive advantages in the market. Yes. I think the margin, there's a combination of professional services is part of that, as I just described. We're certainly seeing as we talked about as we headed into the year with our guidance, a return of some of the, I'd say, COVID cost savings. Some of those are in the SG&A lines. Some of those are in cost of sales, particularly billable travel. So while we still currently and expect in the future to deliver a significant amount of services remotely as we did during COVID, there is billable travel returning across some segments of our business. And so that's having an impact from margins, which we expected. And then we've talked about some of the transaction cost, the bubble costs associated with our cloud transition and specifically with the move from our proprietary data centers to AWS. And so those things are generally in line with what we expected. We did have also a bit higher revenue stream from the COVID-related revenues at NIC. Those have typically a bit lower margin than Tyler's overall margin. So the sort of over-performance in those revenues had a negative margin impact. And as we've said, we expect those to -- the last of those to go away at the end in the third quarter. So that will be a positive from a margin perspective. Yes. I think, Charlie, we're on track with our internal plans, both in terms of where we are with our product investments, what we've outlined for plans to exit our data centers. And when we talk about sort of getting the other side of the bubble costs. So right now, internally, I'm pleased with where we're sitting. Yes, sure, Rob. I appreciate that comment. I'd say public safety right now, the market has moved back to sort of pretty much back to normal. Our competitive landscape. I like our position. There's a couple of strong competitors. We've talked about them before. We've also know that there's some competitors out there that are in that space that are carrying a lot of debt, which I think are probably with the change in rates might be impacting their ability to execute. We've seen some reports on some smaller competitors who may be going through a little bit more difficult time and seen some layoffs and things like that. But right now, we're pretty pleased with where we sit. We made a big investment years ago into things like mobility. And that continues to be a significant competitive edge for us, along with, as you mentioned, leveraging a lot of these other acquisitions we've done in our Tyler Alliance story. I mentioned in my opening comments, the contract with Lima County, Ohio, which was principally -- we sold our Enterprise Courts & Justice product and some things on the C&J side, but also the public safety side and that Alliance story really resonated with the client. So we're starting to see good things there. The market is still, I think, somewhat resistant to the cloud, but we're starting to get some SaaS deals done. We're looking at potentially getting our first beta client in the AWS Cloud, maybe later this year or early next year. So there's some exciting things going on in that market. Yes, sure, Alex. So -- and you're right, most of our maintenance contracts are annual agreements. We do have a few multiyear ones. A small percentage of those have built-in escalators, but generally, most of them have the ability to adjust pricing on an annual basis. Some of those are tied to CPI, but I think that's probably not the majority. But there is some flexibility there. And we took a look at that this spring. Still a majority of our maintenance contracts are on the sort of the June 30, July 1 cycle, and it's something that we talked about internally back in March and April before we went out. As it relates to SaaS contracts, similar things. I mean we -- these are -- after you get through the initial engagement, you do have the ability to start putting in price increases. A lot of our initial SaaS deals are multiyear terms. Some of them are they may be built-in escalators, but the way the revenue recognition has worked historically is that we actually have been recognizing them on more of a flat rate. So there can be a little bit of a declining margin. It's one of the reasons why we've tried really hard to shorten the length of those initial contracts, but we're also looking at doing some things with contract terms so that we will be able to get those built-in escalators. We do price them in. So we're getting the cash in those agreements. And then as they roll off and we move into their annual renewals, we'll have the ability to change that pricing even more. But there are obviously some existing agreements that are out there that had pricing that was built in a year or two ago that we're -- we can't adjust at this point. Yes. And on the second question around use of cash, you're right. Our priority still is debt pay downs. But we're still actively looking at acquisitions. We're not -- it's not like we've closed the door. We're not answering calls. We've been actively looking. We've participated in a couple of processes this year. Obviously, we purchased USD Direct early in the year. But we need something compelling and something that's really at a reasonable valuation. What we've seen in the acquisition front, at least even recently, even as the broader markets have gone through a little bit of turbulence in the last few months. The expectations for some of these private companies has not changed. And in fact, in some cases, has almost exceeded. I mean if people pitch deals where they tell me that I need to be paying higher valuations than Tyler. And that's a little bit hard for me to understand. It's a bit of a head scratcher. Our debt right now is our blended rate is about -- after we make this payment this month. It will be about 2%. But that's really a function of the fact that we've paid so much debt down. when we first took out our debt, I think our convertible was about 34% of our total debt. After this payment this month. It will be more just over 50%. So as we continue to pay our term down, we won't be as impacted by interest rates as we look out over the next year, which is nice. As it relates to share repurchases, I think right now, I agree with you as I look out five years, seven years from now, the stock could look pretty attractive. But I think unless we're really wanting to do a significant move, I'd rather just pay down the debt in the near term. Yes. And just to add to that, Jonathan, that last point that Brian said, I think is worth emphasizing. Using -- leveraging our strong position in -- it's still an anchor. It's still the gateway and the ability to take some of these other investments we've done, whether it's around corrections like the Dallas County Jail deal, but even supervision, if you remember a few years ago, I think it was about four years ago, we did an acquisition of a company called CaseloadPRO. And we won this -- we signed this in Q2, L.A. County, for enterprise supervision, supervision. That's pre trial. We talked about the different areas and even in supervision, whether it's juvenile adult and things like that. And we think we're going to be adding those additional solutions to L.A. County, which is the largest coronal justice departments and counties in the United States. So. Yes. I think the excitement that we see in the cross opportunities and the things that we can do together, that just naturally flows up and down the organization, and I think that helps with retention. Yes. I think, Clarke, obviously, taking out the near-term growth headwind of COVID, which I assume that, that was part of your -- you've taken that out. But as we go forward, it's like a lot of acquisitions. I mean they're a big stand-alone division within Tyler. But to Brian's point, a lot of the cross-sell opportunities whether or not internally, we recognize those on a different division P&L versus NIC's P&L. I think as you go over time, we don't really report on specific organic growth within our business units. And you'll see some of that just the opportunities are there. And as payments grows, some of that payments business may go to our ERP because it's going to their client base, but I see played a significant hand just like the vend engine deal in Arkansas, Kentucky, that revenue really doesn't happen without NIC yet it's sitting on the books over in our Courts & Justice division. So I think as we go forward, you'll probably see us less comment on their specific revenues and growth as they just become more integrated with NIC. We've kind of thought it was appropriate, really for the first year or so, but it will be like the rest of our other divisions because there's so much as we talked about, a lot of our opportunities are through cross-sells and how we leverage each other. And so to us, at one point, it just becomes all Tyler. Okay. Great. Thanks, Chris, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any more questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day."

Our first quarter results surpassed our expectations and provided a very strong start to 2022. Total revenues grew approximately 55% with robust organic growth of 12.8%, the highest in 20 quarters. NIC continued to perform well in the first quarter, with core revenue growth of 13%, excluding COVID-related revenues. NIC's growth was boosted by revenues under the new statewide payments contract in Florida and in particular, by revenues associated with corporate filings with the Department of State that are concentrated in the first quarter. NIC's COVID-related revenues were in line with our expectations at $20.6 million. Recurring revenues comprised 79.5% of our quarterly revenues and were led by 140% growth in subscription revenues. On an organic basis, subscription revenues grew a robust 33.8%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth in transaction-based revenues. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 57 of the last 65 quarters. We're particularly pleased with our strong revenue growth even as we saw an acceleration of the shift in our new software contract mix from licenses to SaaS. In Q1, 80% of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 66% in Q1 last year. As we outlined on our last earnings call, while our move to the cloud builds long-term value, margins compressed in Q1, reflecting the new business mix shift, the inclusion of NIC and in particular, their COVID-related revenues, as well as expenses related to the cloud transition. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 250 basis points year-over-year to 24.3% but increased 70 basis points sequentially from Q4 of 2021. We continue to be very pleased with NIC's performance and with the growing pipeline of joint opportunities for Tyler and NIC. During the first quarter, NIC successfully extended our enterprise contract in Alabama. And in April, we extended our enterprise agreement with New Jersey. NIC also signed a new 5-year SaaS deal with the State of Mississippi to provide our NIC cannabis licensing platform valued at approximately $4.3 million. We continue to experience success with sell-through deals of Tyler products through NIC's state relationships. In Q1, those deals included sales of our data and insights platform to the state of Vermont and our entellitrak platform for Veterans Affairs in Alabama. We also signed agreements for NIC's payments platform with existing Tyler clients in Hillsboro County, Florida; Montgomery County, Maryland; and Glendale, California. Our largest new deal in the quarter was a SaaS arrangement with the San Diego Association of Governments for Enterprise ERP powered by Munis solution, along with our data and insight solution valued at approximately $4.9 million, win five notable SaaS deals, each with a total contract value greater than $2 million with Glen County, Georgia for our enterprise assessment and tax powered by IAS World Solution; the cities of Rialto, California and Alamagordo, New Mexico for our enterprise ERP powered by Munis; and enterprise permitting and licensing powered by EnerGov; and the cities of Mansfield and Burson in Texas for our enterprise ERP powered by Munis solution. Our largest license deal in Q1 was a $2.7 million agreement with the Utah Department of Public Safety, our first public safety deployment in the state of Utah. The deal includes enterprise law enforcement records, mobile, field mobile, enforcement mobile and public safety analytics.  We also signed four other notable license arrangements in the quarter, each with a total contract value -- than $1 million with the St. Johns County property appraiser in Florida for our enterprise assessment and tax powered by IAS World; the city of Elmhurst, Illinois for our enterprise ERP powered by Munis solution, St. Mary's County government in Maryland for our enterprise public safety, powered by New World and Data and insight solutions, and the city of Virginia Beach, Virginia for our enforcement mobile powered by Brazeau solution. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our updated guidance for 2022.\nBrian Miller : Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022. In our earnings release, we've included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $456.1 million, up 54.7% with the inclusion of NIC and our other acquisitions from the last 12 months. Organic revenue growth was the highest since Q4 of 2016 at 12.8%. Software licenses and services grew 24.7% or 3.7%, excluding NIC. Subscription revenues rose 139.5% with very strong organic growth of 33.8%. We added 149 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a new high of 88 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $76 million in total contract value. In Q1 of last year, we added 84 new subscription-based arrangements and had 39 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $52 million in total contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the first quarter added $16.2 million in new ARR. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 80% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 66% in Q1 of last year, reflecting our ongoing shift to a cloud-first approach to sales and increasing client preferences for cloud-based solutions. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.4 years compared to 4.0 years last year. Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $150.9 million, up 461%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 9.8%. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $18.2 million, up 16.9%. For the first quarter, our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $1.45 billion, up 63.6%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was approximately $378.1 million, up 25.1%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $603.7 million, up 461%. And non-GAAP maintenance ARR was down slightly at approximately $468.1 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.76 billion, up 13.8%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction-based, their backlog at quarter end was only $26.3 million. Excluding the addition of NIC, Tyler's backlog grew 12.1%. Bookings in the quarter were strong at approximately $419 million, up 70.1% including the transaction-based revenues at NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were also quite robust at approximately $283 million, up 14.7%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.9 billion, up 65% and on an organic basis, were approximately $1.4 billion, up 21.7%. If our weighted average contract term for new SaaS contracts has been the same as last year, organic bookings growth would have been 17.1%. Cash from operations declined this quarter by 25.3% to $53.5 million, mainly due to changes in working capital related to higher payments of accrued incentive compensation and cash tax payments related to stock-based compensation. Free cash flow declined by 33.5% to $41 million due to the decrease in cash from operations and somewhat higher capital spending this quarter. Our balance sheet remains very strong. During the quarter, we repaid $20 million of our term debt. And since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $415 million of term debt. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.32 billion and cash and investments of $322.6 million and net leverage of approximately 2.1x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. As Lynn mentioned earlier, we're off to a great start in 2022, resulting in an improvement in our outlook for the full year. As a result, we have raised our 2022 annual revenue and earnings guidance as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.835 billion and $1.87 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic revenue growth of approximately 9.5%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $40 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and pandemic rent relief services. The TourHealth revenues are currently expected to continue through the second quarter of 2022 while revenues from the rent relief program are expected to continue through the third quarter. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.92 and $4.08 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.48 and $7.64. Based on updated assumptions regarding additional interest rate hikes this year, we have increased our estimated -- expense for the year by $3.4 million to $23 million, with an impact on non-GAAP diluted EPS of approximately $0.06 a share. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. Finally, before I turn the call back to Lynn, I'd like to announce that Hala Elsherbini, will be joining Tyler as Senior Director of Investor Relations, effective May 9. Many of you have worked with Hala in the past, and we're very excited to have an IR professional with Hala's experience and knowledge of Tyler join our team. Lynn?\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. I'm very pleased with our first quarter performance and our outlook for the year. Activity in our public sector market continues to trend positively, and we are well positioned to take advantage of the continued strength in our market. We remain on track with our strategic initiatives, including our development projects to optimize our products for more efficient deployment in the cloud and our cloud-first approach to sales, which we believe will create significant long-term value for clients and shareholders alike. Our balance sheet and cash flow remained very strong and we continue to be opportunistic with regard to capital allocation. We're excited about the acquisition of US eDirect in February, which significantly expands our outdoor recreation portfolio, allowing us to offer an extensive all-in-one outdoor recreation solution that will seamlessly integrate with our NIC payments platform. While we continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities, we are heavily focused on the integration and execution around the acquisitions we've completed over the last 2 years, making the bar on new acquisitions at this time relatively high. Last Thursday marked the 1-year anniversary of our landmark acquisition of NIC. As I reflect on the acquisition and all that we have accomplished as a -- entity over the last 12 months, I can truly say that it has exceeded our expectations, which were already high. Our teams have come together as one unified organization and our collective excitement about the opportunities that the combination unlocks has continued to grow. We've integrated our payments teams and have refined our strategy to pursue what we believe is a huge TAM in government payments. As we've discussed, we're winning new business with sell-throughs into our respective client bases. In this quarter, we doubled the number of sell-through opportunities in our pipeline. We look forward to continuing to report on our progress in the second year of our combination. The challenges of today's labor market continue to be an area of significant focus for us. While we added 195 new team members in the first quarter, we currently have a higher-than-normal number of open positions. Although our open positions have a short-term positive impact on margins, we have aggressive hiring plans for the balance of the year to support our growth. Finally, we're extremely excited to host clients live and in person at Connect, our annual user conference, which will take place in Indianapolis for May 15 through May 18. With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question from Jonathan Ho from William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: Congratulations on the strong quarter. I just wanted to maybe start out with your thoughts around just the win rates that you're seeing and potentially whether the investments that you've made over the past few years are now starting to have an impact as you start to look at the state of competition?\nLynn Moore: Yes. Sure, Jonathan. And I think that's right. The markets right now are really strong. I'd say they're probably about as strong as I can remember. And our competitive position is really high, really across the board. You're right, we pre-COVID, we went through a significant period of elevated investments, and I think that's really paying off right now across all of our lines of business. Our win rates are strong. Our final rates are strong. It's really setting us up well for the next few years. And so I appreciate that comment.\nJonathan Ho: Got it. Got it. And then just as a follow-up, how should we think about sort of the pace of integration that we're seeing with AWS? And maybe what customers, when you've had some discussions with them, what's that reception been like in terms of potentially shifting from Tyler hosted to AWS?\nLynn Moore: Yes, I think that's going real well, Jonathan. AWS is going to be a great long-term partner for us. We're already starting to move customers into the AWS cloud. We're working on plans right now to exit the Tyler data centers over the next couple of years and move them into AWS. They're a great partner. Where we're going with our cloud initiative lines up well, our cultures line up well. And our clients see that. Our clients see the benefits. They see the future road map that we've laid out and our clients are excited about it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Pete Heckmann from D.A. Davidson.\nPete Heckmann: Just two questions on the annual guidance. Your very strong organic subscription growth of the first quarter seems to argue that, at least the way I look at my model, I have something more in the mid- to high teens embedded for organic growth for subscription revenue for the rest of the year, and I'm getting into the top end of your revenue guidance. Are there some other considerations we should think about why subscription revenue growth wouldn't continue to run at this elevated rate for the rest of the year?\nBrian Miller : Well, Pete, I think the biggest factor there, and we mentioned it in the remarks, is there is some seasonality around some of the transaction-based revenues around payments. There's, I think, two things around that. One, as we pointed out, the Florida contract for statewide payments with NIC, which is a new contract, is ramping up, but there were some revenues in Q1 that are specific to Q1 around filings -- revenues associated with corporate filings with the Department of State in Florida. And that added, I think, roughly close to $6.5 million of revenue in subscriptions in Q1. And so actually accounted for a couple hundred basis points of overall growth in the quarter that really aren't expected to be there throughout the year. And then seasonally, in Q4, some of the transaction-based revenues around the portals tend to be a little lighter as well. So I think those are the biggest factors. But certainly, we have an opportunity to continue to broaden our subscription revenues as we move through the year. But I keep those seasonality factors in mind.\nLynn Moore: Yes. I think, Pete, I'd just add that the thing about the Secretary State filings in Florida is it was a little bit somewhat unexpected as we entered the year. And I think it shows the potential of not just the Florida payment contracts and extending it beyond what I think probably NIC's original expectations were before they joined Tyler, but really the things that we can do across the country. And so while there's some seasonality to that, to me, it's an exciting indicator things that we can achieve down the road.\nPete Heckmann: Great. Great. And that helps. I missed the significance of that. And then just in terms of the expense ramp we talked about last quarter that's embedded in your annual guidance, you talked about maybe hiring running behind schedule. But generally, would you say that the expense levels in the first quarter were at your expectations? A little bit below? I'm just trying to figure out if that contributed to the upside, at least from our forecast to the earnings number in the quarter.\nLynn Moore: Yes. I'd say as it relates to headcount, Pete, is probably a little bit below, and that's been really the case for probably at least a year or so. And my sense is that's the case generally across all industries right now. There's certainly a lot of labor market challenges. It certainly helps with margins in the short term. We want to be a little more aggressive, and we are aggressive. We are -- our HR department is working hard but -- so that we can deliver on a lot of the sales, the good sales activity that we've had over the long run, being able to get these installations deployed, continuing to keep our customers happy is going to require getting some of those heads in.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Josh Reilly from Needham.\nJosh Reilly : Congrats on the strong quarter here. How would you characterize the impact of the stimulus funds benefiting the 13% organic growth rate in the quarter? And how much of a tailwind can this be over the next couple of years? Is it closer to a 1- to 2-point benefit? Or could it be up to a 5-point benefit to sales?\nLynn Moore: Yes, Josh, it's a good question. It's, at times -- it's hard to sometimes to isolate. I think what I would say -- I'd go back to my comment to Jonathan's question about the budgets overall. From what I'm seeing right now, our clients' budgets are as healthy as they've ever been. Leading up 2018, 2019, the economy was really good. The budgets were really strong. There was an anticipation of negative COVID impact that prediction really didn't come through. And since then, as you mentioned, we've lumped on a lot of stimulus money. In addition to that, and I think I mentioned on the last call, perhaps we all see what's going on out there in the real estate market and the boom that's going on there, which is driving appraisals and valuations up, which further than drives up assessments and property taxes, which is a big funder of a lot of our -- particularly with our local government clients. We're seeing the impact. It's sometimes hard to track individual deals. But we're certainly seeing the impact and the fact that I think it's a very robust market right now. You got something?\nBrian Miller : Yes. All I would add is that the stimulus money is available through the end of 2024 for them to make commitments around spending that. And so I'd say we're still -- we believe a lot of governments haven't -- certainly haven't fully spent their funds or still in the process of determining where those will be spent. So we believe it's a a potential tailwind through the next 2 or 3 years. But I'd say right now, it's probably -- if there's an impact there, it's probably fairly modest. It's not 5 points of growth. But it's certainly part of that very active market we're seeing.\nJosh Reilly : Got it. That's helpful. And then just curious on the US eDirect acquisition, is there anything specific in terms of the functionality that you acquired there that's different than what you had internally for parks and recreation?\nLynn Moore: Yes, sure. And I'd say the answer to that is yes, we're really good complement. I mean, the outdoor market is something that we believe is a good growth opportunity. We believe the TAM is there. There is demand for this sort of all-in-one solution. And really what NIC brought was really a first-in-class solution around hunting and fishing licenses and US eDirect really was a leading outdoor reservation platform. So it sort of combines that into creating, as we said, sort of an all-in-one opportunity. We've seen the pipeline already just this year grow significantly in that space. And I think one of the things that we're excited about is not just combining the NIC technology with US eDirect, which is also, by the way, deployed in AWS, but our ability to go out and sell it. So it's a solution -- when you talk about outdoor reservations and stuff, it's not just going in the states, which will be through NIC sales channels, but we also have the ability to go sell it more locally through some of Tyler's sales channels.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Terry Tillman from Truist Securities.\nTerry Tillman: And -- the congrats on the first quarter results. Maybe a couple of questions for me. And one is a follow-up to a prior question on the stimulus dollars. What about on the enterprise ERP business side? So those are longer sales cycle type deals, big transformation projects. I think maybe you mentioned San Diego. But how is that sales pipeline playing out? And do you see like a quarter where -- if the pipeline is building, where you see a lot of conversions? Or do you think that's going to be more smooth over the next couple of years -- 2 or 3 years on the enterprise ERP side?\nLynn Moore: Yes. I think, generally speaking, what we're seeing on enterprise ERP is the market is, and the deals that we're signing each quarter, really reflects sort of pre-COVID levels. So that's very encouraging. We have identified a handful of deals that are specific -- that can be tied specifically to the ARPA funding and things like that. But again, sometimes it's hard to know specifically where a jurisdiction, how they allocate those funds. We don't normally sort of get that 1:1 rate. Our growth -- our deal volume is enterprise ERP is good. We're really focusing on expanding payments through that customer base. As you mentioned, we're focusing on expanding our flips, which are continuing to increase at a faster rate quarter-by-quarter. Our installed client sales continue to be really strong there. So it's a very healthy business that's continuing to grow, and we're pretty pleased with the outlook.\nTerry Tillman: Got it. And on the state of Utah, that was great to see that state-wide public safety deal. Maybe, and maybe easier said than done, but it seems like a great rinse and repeat opportunity across the broader NIC customer base with all these public safety solutions you have. Not trying to put you on the spot, but could we see more, and more quickly, with a repeat of what we saw with State Utah on the public safety side?\nLynn Moore: Well, we're -- I guess I'd step back and just say, yes, we're excited about all of our cross-sell opportunities through the NIC base. The Utah deal was a great win for our public safety team. Very large contract. I think it's early to say that -- I mean, obviously, part of our sales plan is to repeat these types of wins. That's part of our playbook. It may be -- to say that those can happen relatively quickly. Sales cycles still sort of take a life of their own, but we're excited the way our teams are working together across all of our products and the potential with NIC.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt VanVliet from BTIG.\nMatt VanVliet: Nice job on the quarter. Lynn, I wanted to follow up on something you mentioned at the end of your prepared remarks, and maybe it's a bit of a follow-up to Terry's last question there. But you mentioned that the pipeline for sell-through opportunities has doubled. Curious if you look at the assessment of kind of all of the NIC customer portfolio, how far along are you in terms of kind of following up with those potential sell-through opportunities? Have you doubled that? Have you sort of gotten to all of those customers? Or is there still more that could be added to the pipeline in the near term?\nLynn Moore: Yes, I would say we're a year now into the NIC acquisition. Standing here a year later, I'm more than pleasantly surprised at how the teams are working and the number of opportunities that have already surfaced. Stepping back, looking at maybe a 20,000-foot level, we may still be in the first inning of this deal. We've got a long way to go. We're still learning about each other. We're still learning -- while we spent a lot of time last year educating both teams on products and sales channels and the ways to go about addressing the market, I think we're just barely scratching the surface of what we can achieve together.\nMatt VanVliet: All right. Very helpful. And then I guess maybe thinking about the stimulus and the ARPA funds from a little different angle. Have you seen sales cycles shorten at all? Or do you feel like some deals have gotten pushed through maybe a little more quickly because there's more budget dollars available? And would you allocate some of that rationale to having more of the stimulus funds out there? Or has there not been any kind of consistency across the time to contract?\nLynn Moore: Yes. I would say that on one level, it's -- I've talked about the robust market. I think my comment there would be, some of it is still just release of pent-up demand during COVID. I do think we're seeing a little bit maybe quicker sales cycles in some of our inside sales and that may be a little bit more directly tied to some ARPA funding. But we're also -- one thing I didn't mention earlier is one of the things that we're doing across Tyler is we're being pretty proactive about marketing the availability of the ARPA funds and how our clients can use them. We've done several webinars and podcasts and blogs and e-mails to sort of help stimulate that use and hopefully direct some of it to Tyler.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Saket Kalia from Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Appreciate you having me on the call. Maybe first for you, Brian, actually, just to maybe mix it up. It felt like software and services bookings were maybe stronger than what we've seen historically and SaaS was maybe a little bit more in line. And again, that's on a bookings perspective. Part of that, I think, you called out is rightfully duration. But curious if you saw anything in mix or preference for on-prem versus SaaS? And how are you sort of thinking about that for the rest of the year?\nBrian Miller : Yes. I think it was an interesting quarter from a new business perspective because even though SaaS, as a percentage of the new deal volume increased pretty significantly over last year from 66% to 80%. And we also saw growth in license revenues and had several pretty decent sized, not super large, but several decent-sized license deals, including the Utah Public Safety deal and some ERP deals. So we saw a little bit of both. On a broad basis, our expectation for the year is around 80 to the low 80s percentage of our new contract volume coming in, in SaaS. So we're generally on line with that, but we would expect that we continue to see an ongoing shift towards that preference for new customers to come through the cloud. And as we talked about at year-end, part of that is -- reflects the change in our approach to sales and including a number of significant products that are now only available through the cloud that are no longer being offered in a license model in new proposals. So yes, we'd expect that trend to continue through the year.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Got it. Lynn, maybe that's a good segue for a question I have for you. We've talked about some tools that were offered both on-prem and SaaS but might phase out on-prem this year. I think we've talked about maybe 1 or 2 of the ERP products as an example. Can you just recap that for us? And then without preannouncing anything, of course, but are there other products where that might make sense to do as well in terms of leading with SaaS and maybe not even offering on-prem anymore? Does that make sense?\nLynn Moore: Yes. No, I understand your question, and you're right. So coming into this year, and we announced, I think maybe in Q3 of last year, certainly on the Q4 call, our enterprise ERP powered by Munis solutions are now really just being offered in a SaaS model. I have made the comment that you should expect to see more of our core flagship products move in that direction including probably one later this year and moving into next year. I'm a little hesitant to outline some of that right now because we haven't even notified all of our customers yet of our future strategy. Our clients generally know that we are going cloud first. That's not a surprise to anyone. But in terms of specific time lines, I'd rather sort of keep that messaging within us right now until we're ready to do that. But that's our strategic direction. It's not a surprise to anyone. We're making progress on our cloud initiatives, and we will reach the point generally across our portfolio with perhaps the exception of parts of public safety, which will be a little bit -- which will be market driven. And then we talked before, they've been a little bit slower to move to the cloud.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is David [Unger] filling in for Michael Turrin. I just wanted to focus on free cash flow margin. Brian, I know you mentioned there were some things that happened this quarter. You mentioned cash taxes and working capital. But I just wanted to get a sense for -- I mean, historically, you do like 22% free cash flow margin over the past 5 years. So I just wanted to get an understanding of the seasonality of that and how that will work itself out over the course of the year?\nBrian Miller : Yes. I generally expect that our free cash flow margins, there's a lot of puts and takes there. But generally, as we move through this year, probably in line with that historical number. Very seasonal in terms of being weighted towards the third quarter. A lot of that has to do with the vast majority of our maintenance renewals, which are around $470 million a year of maintenance revenues. The vast majority of those renew as of July 1. And so we typically bill those in Q2 and collect them in Q3. So that drives really strong growth in our cash flow in our cash flow in Q3. And other than that transaction revenues, we've talked about some seasonality around those being a little lighter in Q4. But as we continue to expand the subscription business, that tends to smooth out the cash flow. So Q3 -- Q1 is typically the lightest. Q3 is very much the strongest, but I think the margins, you can expect to be fairly consistent.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And I know there are several questions asked about the fiscal stimulus, and this is -- sorry to beat the dead horse on this, but I think it's maybe a couple of quarters ago, you mentioned the couple dozen or so deals that are in the pipeline that are sourced from fiscal stimulus. Is that still roughly a similar type number? Just trying to get a sense of that.\nBrian Miller : Yes, it's probably similar. But as Lynn said, it becomes harder and harder to identify deals that are specifically funded by stimulus. And there are certainly some of those. But in a lot of cases, the stimulus may be used for something else, but frees up funds that are then used to move forward with something they're purchasing from us. So it's not exactly a science trying to pin down that number. But I'd say it's probably a fairly consistent number of deals that we're seeing, which is consistent with what we're saying that we expect this not to be a big flood of new business at one time, but to be somewhat of a tailwind over the next, call it, 3 years.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Charles Strauzer from CJS Securities.\nCharles Strauzer: Brian, maybe you can help me with this on. Looking at Q2, other than the continuation of the COVID revenue, what are the factors should we think about when we build out our model for Q2?\nBrian Miller : This -- I don't think there's anything particularly unusual to think about in Q2. We would expect, I think, licenses to likely be at a fairly similar level to what we saw in Q1. Subscriptions should continue to grow. I think maintenance, as we've said in the past, for the year is likely to be flat to down low single digits, and I think we'll continue to see that trend as we have more and more on-prem clients move to subscription. But I think those broad ranges of growth that we talked about on the year-end call are still generally true. When we talk about -- we don't give quarterly guidance, but when we talk about the full year, I think licenses will likely see a mid-single-digit decline. Services are likely to be around the mid-teens kind of growth. Subscriptions, expect to remain really solid growth in the 25% to 30% range for the year. Maintenance, as I said, flat to down low single digits. Appraisal is seeing a nice resurgence in activity after some slowdowns during COVID and expect to see high teens growth there. And hardware is a much smaller piece of our business. But with Connect coming back in person this year, those revenues fall there. So we expect to see kind of mid-30% growth on a relatively small base of revenues in hardware and other.\nLynn Moore: Yes. And then I'd probably add to that, Charlie, I think we mentioned earlier, the COVID -- the TourHealth revenues out of NIC should -- our expectation is those pretty much wind down in Q2.\nCharles Strauzer: Great. That's very helpful. And then just lastly for me on the cash flow side, is debt pay down is still kind of your top priority for use of cash?\nLynn Moore: I'm sorry -- yes. So yes, Charlie, I think right now, our priority is to pay down the debt, particularly as interest rates have continued to increase. We already talked about readjusting our plan for the higher rates and it costs us an extra $0.06. So that's our priority. We're continuing to do everything else we've always done, which is be opportunistic, look at our internal R&D. We continue to look at acquisitions. With the softness in the market, we'll continue to evaluate repurchase opportunities versus the paying down the debt. But I'd say right now, that's our priority. Just as a reminder, as Brian mentioned, we paid down $415 million of the debt. And of our outstanding debt, about $600 million is sitting in a convertible, which right now is about 45%, and that's at a fixed rate 25 basis points that's not maturing until '26. I'd like to see us get some of that bank debt paid down. But again, if opportunities present themselves, we'll probably move on those as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Lynn, when you look at the sort of organic Tyler business and you think across ERP and Munis, Courts & Justice, Public Safety, my sense listening to you is that the pipeline is pretty balanced and you're seeing a nice sort of rebound or growth in all of those areas. Are there any sort of points of strength versus maybe not as strong yet? I was just kind of curious how we should think about that if there's any one product that kind of leads you out of a downturn or if they're all pretty balanced right now?\nLynn Moore: I'd say generally, they're pretty balanced. Like I mentioned earlier, our reprise ERP, powered by Munis solution, that market is -- we're seeing the deal volume that's similar to pre-COVID. Really, at the lower end, we continue to see deal volume and growth higher than pre-COVID, which is great. And that's our ERP Pro, our old [incode] solution. If you look at our appraisal and tax solutions, we started to see some increasing sales momentum late last year, and we're seeing that start to continue. You look at Courts & Justice, we've made a number of acquisitions in the last couple of years, and we're pretty bullish on expanding those markets, whether it's our vend engine, our corrections. There's a lot of opportunity there. We're seeing that. We're also -- I think we sort of referenced it, our e-filing is back to prepandemic levels, which is good to see. And public safety continues to do the things that we expected to do with out of these investments. They signed another large deal. Their competitive position is strong. They've done a good job with their clients on some of these new products, getting them live, getting them settle, getting referenceable. So across the board, it's pretty good across the board, maybe it's a few places a little bit better than others, but generally speaking, I'd say it's pretty healthy.\nKirk Materne: That's helpful. And Brian, with 80 -- around 80% of the sort of booked software in the quarter being more subscription-based. If it continues at this rate, does the overhang on margins in terms of the conversion essentially start to drop off a little bit? I'm just trying to get a sense on how much of sort of the overhang on margins that we're looking ahead is just on sort of the business model conversion versus more discrete items?\nBrian Miller : Yes. I think that kind of fits in with what we talked about at year-end as kind of what we expect to see with margins over the next couple of years, and we talked about the pressure on margins from not just the bubble costs associated with the cloud transition and moving from Tyler data centers to AWS. But the impact on margins and revenue from sort of the runoff of the licenses and as those -- as that business continues to shift towards a higher percentage coming in the SaaS. And we said, really, by the end of -- both of those have impacts over the next couple of years. But we think that sort of that inflection point where licenses or the runoff of the remaining licenses or the shift of those into SaaS model no longer has a negative impact on margins because we have built up that run rate of subscription revenues, and we really believe that 2023 is sort of the trough on margins. And that after that -- and part of that is the lessening of the impact of the mix shift. So what we're seeing this year is pretty much in line with how we looked at the estimated mix going in. But we do expect that percentage at 80% to continue to grow.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: So I guess I want to drill into a figure that you're -- that you give us in the supplemental disclosures, and that's calculated SaaS net new ARR. I'm trying to square the commentary around the strength of the subscription business as a percentage -- or of SaaS contracts as a percentage of the total going up year-over-year. But then when I look at net new ARR of $6 million, it's down pretty substantially year-over-year and sequentially. And I know that's a very volatile seasonal metric. But just help us understand why that is? Also, if you think about the year in terms of the mix between new core Tyler business license versus SaaS, how are we thinking about that? Meaning -- like what type of net new ARR growth should we kind of think about this year versus the kind of license decline? Or is license going to be flat? I think that would be a good thing to just explore.\nBrian Miller : Yes. There is some lumpiness in the growth in ARR around -- as there is with our license and our bookings. We do expect for the full year licenses to decline and to be down likely sort of in the mid-single digits. And we expect subscription revenues to grow in the 25% to 30% range. And we would expect that new ARR would also grow in that 25% to 30% range.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. Okay. And so I guess, from a -- is there anything that was just different seasonally from a deal construction standpoint this quarter versus maybe previous last year's Q1 or anything to read into?\nBrian Miller : Not that I'm aware of. I think it's just a little bit of the lumpiness of the structure of the contracts, but not aware of anything that's particularly notable in terms of a difference from the prior year.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. And then I guess, are the -- do you feel like -- it sounds like you were a little surprised at the strength of the license business in Q1. Is there -- do you feel like those changes -- it's going to be the changes in the incentive structures or in the product that's going to drive that change in mix in the second half? Or I guess, what -- where could you be wrong with respect to that?\nLynn Moore: I'd say there that for the year, I think our licenses are sort of on track with our plan. They were a little higher in Q1 than our expectations. Some of that comes through our robust inside sales. Some of those -- or tend to be -- have trended to be more license than our expectation. Our new business generally is in line with our expectation. I think our licenses outlook for the year is in line, but it was higher in Q1, which obviously helped with our organic growth number.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. And then just the last one on cash flow. I guess, Brian, if you think about it as we progress through the year given those -- given some of those mix shift dynamics, what's the right way to think about the free cash flow progression through the year?\nBrian Miller : Yes, I still think that, again, we still have a big base of maintenance, that a lot of that cash flow comes in Q3. So still expect that the progression will probably be similar to what we saw last year that Q3 would be, by far, the peak of cash flow, but Q4 should be relatively strong as well. But I think we still sort of follow the historical seasonality of cash flow. Our CapEx should be fairly consistent across the year. And the -- obviously, the recurring revenues with a much bigger base of transaction-based revenues helped smooth out the seasonality around that piece of our revenues.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Housum from Northcoast Research.\nKeith Housum: Just following up on the last question actually. I was going to ask the same thing but more from a booking standpoint. Bookings in the quarter of $419 million were the lowest of the past 4 quarters. Is it just a matter of more timing in terms of either the pipeline is healthy, but the deals haven't closed just given some the optimism we're hearing here? Or is duration playing a part of it where that durations attributing to, I guess, lower bookings amount this quarter than what we see in the past 3?\nBrian Miller : Yes. Duration is certainly a part of it. This quarter with the 3.4 years duration of our new subscription deals is much closer to what we're trying to drive to with sort of a standard of 3 years on most of our new subscription deals. So that certainly played a part in it. It's down from 4 years last year. And I think that also would be the lowest average duration we've seen over, call it, the last year or so. So I think that's playing a part in it. Bookings growth on an organic basis was still pretty solid at north of -- I think, the number was 14%. So duration certainly would be one of the factors there. But we feel pretty good about bookings growth actually being on an organic basis being ahead of where revenue growth currently is.\nKeith Housum: Okay. I appreciate that. And in terms of the --\nBrian Miller : Again on maintenance because those bookings come in when those renewals happen in Q2. Q2 typically is a stronger seasonal bookings quarter just because of where the maintenance falls and Q1 is pretty light there. So it's -- the subscription bookings were certainly the strongest point of the bookings growth this quarter, which is what we like to see.\nKeith Housum: Okay. I appreciate that. And just in terms of the employees, and I appreciate the commentary that there's some more hiring that needs to be done. But can you speak a little bit about, I guess, turnover and inflationary cost pressures? Obviously, it's been a very dynamic quarter in terms of inflationary pressures. But as the year is developing, is it worse than you expected in terms of what you guys are pulling up for new employees? Or just any commentary on that matter?\nLynn Moore: Yes. So there's a lot there, Keith, to talk about. We mentioned, I think, in our last earnings call that part of our OP pressure this year was the fact that we were generally increasing our budget for employee compensation a little higher than we had traditionally. The labor market challenges are out there. Our turnover is higher than historic. But from what we see and the studies that we look at, we still believe it's lower than most in the tech industry. The competition is stuff out there right now. I sometimes look at it, however, in terms of -- when I think about external factors, be it inflation or recession concerns or the labor market is what do we do within Tyler? How does it impact us versus our competitors? And people like to come to work here. We've got a good culture. I like to think that -- some of these things may disproportionately affect some of our maybe perhaps smaller competitors as it relates to inflation and pricing. As you know, most of our agreements or annual agreements or multiyear agreements with some the ability with escalators. We have the ability to adjust those -- adjust pricing on our services that we send out there. So I think we're in a position where we can attack inflation -- inflationary pressures. Our people are working hard to staff and hire. We've got -- we've done a lot of business in the last year, and we need to go execute on some of it. And that's part of it is we need to get some people in here to go execute on some of these deals we've sold.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler.\nBrent Bracelin: Lynn, I wanted to double-click into the payment business, in particular, just revisiting the upside in the quarter from the Florida statewide contract. Pretty meaningful contribution, that begs the question, how many other states are you active in discussions with replicating what you did in Florida today? And then could you maybe talk about the 5-year opportunity? Do you think this is an opportunity where you could get a dozen states that potentially could look more like that Florida contract? Or is it a bigger opportunity than that?\nLynn Moore: Yes. So with the Florida upside in the first quarter around the Secretary of State filings, we anticipated to have the Secretary of State filings, the manner in which the revenue model turned out to be a little bit different than we had anticipated, and we were able to go with the convenience fee as opposed to a per click per payment percentage, and that drove significantly higher dollars to us. My comments are really about the fact that the extension of what we can do with Tyler, we've talked about being able to be in the local markets in Florida. Our ability because of our robust payment engine to be able to do things that certain other payment providers can't do that are in our focus on the government space drives that as you look out towards other states and other localities. But payments is one of our big future growth drivers. It's something that all of our divisions are focusing on. And I think it's something that you're going to see drive growth over time. It's going to -- like a lot of our long-term growth drivers, it will ramp up over time. And if you say, where are we out 5 years from now, we think the market's pretty big. The TAM for payments is, I think, well north of $500 million and we're positioned and are targeting to go get a vast majority of that.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful of color. And then, Brian, just as a follow-up on the maintenance side of the business. Certainly encouraged to see the SaaS mix increasing. Sounding like 80% of new contract volumes are going to be SaaS related. The flip side of that is maintenance. Maintenance, I would expect, at some point, would decline at a steeper pace with that mix shift, but it hasn't yet. I mean -- a slow decline. What's the offset there? What -- is there annual price escalators that are helping insulate maintenance? And again, I understand it's a slow decline here, but what's the offset that maybe we might see a steeper decline and -- or not preventing a steeper decline in maintenance?\nBrian Miller : The offset really is the annual increases. I mean most of our maintenance agreements, the vast majority of them are annual agreements, so renewable annually with pricing adjustments annually. And historically, I'd say, across most of our customers, we're typically in the 4% to 5% annual increase on a pretty consistent basis over a number of years, and that hasn't changed. So yes, on the base, we typically get that, at least low single-digit annual increase. We, as you know, have very, very low attrition in terms of customers leaving us. In terms of dollars, probably around 1%. And then certainly, as fewer new customers come to us in a license model with maintenance that there's smaller and smaller number of new adds, but we have that 20% of our new business that is coming in license does generate new maintenance. And then the bigger impact that is likely to accelerate over the coming years is the flips or the migrations of those on-premise customers that are currently paying us maintenance moving into the cloud and shifting to subscription. So it's a change in what revenue line they come on, but does typically, rough numbers, double what they're paying us over maintenance. So while we lose maintenance revenues, we gain close to 2x that on the subscription line.\nLynn Moore: And I'd add there, Brent, that while we talk about our flips and our flips continue to increase quarter by quarter, I think our flips are year-over-year, up maybe about 125%. Much like my comment on NIC, we're still in the very, very early innings on flips. That's a long road map and a long tailwind. And as our products continue to get more cloud efficient, more cloud optimized, as we as we develop more systems to make that a little bit more of an efficient process, that's something that will be a tailwind for the next several years.\nBrent Bracelin: Great to hear. It looks like that cloud first strategy is resonating out there. So sounds good.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be ending today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Moore, I'll turning the call back over to you for closing remarks.\nLynn Moore: Great. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to myself or Brian Miller. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll be concluding today's conference call. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2022. In our earnings release, we've included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financial Reports tab schedules with supplemental information provided on this call, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. Both GAAP and non-GAAP revenues for the quarter were $456.1 million, up 54.7% with the inclusion of NIC and our other acquisitions from the last 12 months. Organic revenue growth was the highest since Q4 of 2016 at 12.8%. Software licenses and services grew 24.7% or 3.7%, excluding NIC. Subscription revenues rose 139.5% with very strong organic growth of 33.8%. We added 149 new subscription-based arrangements and converted a new high of 88 existing on-premises clients, representing approximately $76 million in total contract value. In Q1 of last year, we added 84 new subscription-based arrangements and had 39 on-premises conversions, representing approximately $52 million in total contract value. Our software subscription bookings in the first quarter added $16.2 million in new ARR. Subscription contract value comprised approximately 80% of the total new software contract value signed this quarter compared to 66% in Q1 of last year, reflecting our ongoing shift to a cloud-first approach to sales and increasing client preferences for cloud-based solutions. The value weighted average term of new SaaS contracts this quarter was 3.4 years compared to 4.0 years last year. Transaction-based revenues, which include NIC portal, payment processing and e-filing revenues and are included in subscriptions, were $150.9 million, up 461%. Excluding NIC, Tyler's transaction-based revenues grew 9.8%. E-filing revenues reached a new high of $18.2 million, up 16.9%. For the first quarter, our non-GAAP ARR was approximately $1.45 billion, up 63.6%. Non-GAAP ARR for SaaS software arrangements was approximately $378.1 million, up 25.1%. Transaction-based ARR was approximately $603.7 million, up 461%. And non-GAAP maintenance ARR was down slightly at approximately $468.1 million due to the continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $1.76 billion, up 13.8%. Because the vast majority of NIC's revenues are transaction-based, their backlog at quarter end was only $26.3 million. Excluding the addition of NIC, Tyler's backlog grew 12.1%. Bookings in the quarter were strong at approximately $419 million, up 70.1% including the transaction-based revenues at NIC. On an organic basis, bookings were also quite robust at approximately $283 million, up 14.7%. For the trailing 12 months, bookings were approximately $1.9 billion, up 65% and on an organic basis, were approximately $1.4 billion, up 21.7%. If our weighted average contract term for new SaaS contracts has been the same as last year, organic bookings growth would have been 17.1%. Cash from operations declined this quarter by 25.3% to $53.5 million, mainly due to changes in working capital related to higher payments of accrued incentive compensation and cash tax payments related to stock-based compensation. Free cash flow declined by 33.5% to $41 million due to the decrease in cash from operations and somewhat higher capital spending this quarter. Our balance sheet remains very strong. During the quarter, we repaid $20 million of our term debt. And since completing the NIC acquisition, we have paid down $415 million of term debt. We ended the quarter with total outstanding debt of $1.32 billion and cash and investments of $322.6 million and net leverage of approximately 2.1x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. As Lynn mentioned earlier, we're off to a great start in 2022, resulting in an improvement in our outlook for the full year. As a result, we have raised our 2022 annual revenue and earnings guidance as follows. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP total revenues will be between $1.835 billion and $1.87 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic revenue growth of approximately 9.5%. We expect total revenues will include approximately $40 million of COVID-related revenues from NIC's TourHealth and pandemic rent relief services. The TourHealth revenues are currently expected to continue through the second quarter of 2022 while revenues from the rent relief program are expected to continue through the third quarter. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.92 and $4.08 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock incentive awards on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.48 and $7.64. Based on updated assumptions regarding additional interest rate hikes this year, we have increased our estimated -- expense for the year by $3.4 million to $23 million, with an impact on non-GAAP diluted EPS of approximately $0.06 a share. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. Finally, before I turn the call back to Lynn, I'd like to announce that Hala Elsherbini, will be joining Tyler as Senior Director of Investor Relations, effective May 9. Many of you have worked with Hala in the past, and we're very excited to have an IR professional with Hala's experience and knowledge of Tyler join our team. Lynn? Well, Pete, I think the biggest factor there, and we mentioned it in the remarks, is there is some seasonality around some of the transaction-based revenues around payments. There's, I think, two things around that. One, as we pointed out, the Florida contract for statewide payments with NIC, which is a new contract, is ramping up, but there were some revenues in Q1 that are specific to Q1 around filings -- revenues associated with corporate filings with the Department of State in Florida. And that added, I think, roughly close to $6.5 million of revenue in subscriptions in Q1. And so actually accounted for a couple hundred basis points of overall growth in the quarter that really aren't expected to be there throughout the year. And then seasonally, in Q4, some of the transaction-based revenues around the portals tend to be a little lighter as well. So I think those are the biggest factors. But certainly, we have an opportunity to continue to broaden our subscription revenues as we move through the year. But I keep those seasonality factors in mind. Yes. All I would add is that the stimulus money is available through the end of 2024 for them to make commitments around spending that. And so I'd say we're still -- we believe a lot of governments haven't -- certainly haven't fully spent their funds or still in the process of determining where those will be spent. So we believe it's a a potential tailwind through the next 2 or 3 years. But I'd say right now, it's probably -- if there's an impact there, it's probably fairly modest. It's not 5 points of growth. But it's certainly part of that very active market we're seeing. Yes. I think it was an interesting quarter from a new business perspective because even though SaaS, as a percentage of the new deal volume increased pretty significantly over last year from 66% to 80%. And we also saw growth in license revenues and had several pretty decent sized, not super large, but several decent-sized license deals, including the Utah Public Safety deal and some ERP deals. So we saw a little bit of both. On a broad basis, our expectation for the year is around 80 to the low 80s percentage of our new contract volume coming in, in SaaS. So we're generally on line with that, but we would expect that we continue to see an ongoing shift towards that preference for new customers to come through the cloud. And as we talked about at year-end, part of that is -- reflects the change in our approach to sales and including a number of significant products that are now only available through the cloud that are no longer being offered in a license model in new proposals. So yes, we'd expect that trend to continue through the year. Yes. I generally expect that our free cash flow margins, there's a lot of puts and takes there. But generally, as we move through this year, probably in line with that historical number. Very seasonal in terms of being weighted towards the third quarter. A lot of that has to do with the vast majority of our maintenance renewals, which are around $470 million a year of maintenance revenues. The vast majority of those renew as of July 1. And so we typically bill those in Q2 and collect them in Q3. So that drives really strong growth in our cash flow in our cash flow in Q3. And other than that transaction revenues, we've talked about some seasonality around those being a little lighter in Q4. But as we continue to expand the subscription business, that tends to smooth out the cash flow. So Q3 -- Q1 is typically the lightest. Q3 is very much the strongest, but I think the margins, you can expect to be fairly consistent. Yes, it's probably similar. But as Lynn said, it becomes harder and harder to identify deals that are specifically funded by stimulus. And there are certainly some of those. But in a lot of cases, the stimulus may be used for something else, but frees up funds that are then used to move forward with something they're purchasing from us. So it's not exactly a science trying to pin down that number. But I'd say it's probably a fairly consistent number of deals that we're seeing, which is consistent with what we're saying that we expect this not to be a big flood of new business at one time, but to be somewhat of a tailwind over the next, call it, 3 years. This -- I don't think there's anything particularly unusual to think about in Q2. We would expect, I think, licenses to likely be at a fairly similar level to what we saw in Q1. Subscriptions should continue to grow. I think maintenance, as we've said in the past, for the year is likely to be flat to down low single digits, and I think we'll continue to see that trend as we have more and more on-prem clients move to subscription. But I think those broad ranges of growth that we talked about on the year-end call are still generally true. When we talk about -- we don't give quarterly guidance, but when we talk about the full year, I think licenses will likely see a mid-single-digit decline. Services are likely to be around the mid-teens kind of growth. Subscriptions, expect to remain really solid growth in the 25% to 30% range for the year. Maintenance, as I said, flat to down low single digits. Appraisal is seeing a nice resurgence in activity after some slowdowns during COVID and expect to see high teens growth there. And hardware is a much smaller piece of our business. But with Connect coming back in person this year, those revenues fall there. So we expect to see kind of mid-30% growth on a relatively small base of revenues in hardware and other. Yes. I think that kind of fits in with what we talked about at year-end as kind of what we expect to see with margins over the next couple of years, and we talked about the pressure on margins from not just the bubble costs associated with the cloud transition and moving from Tyler data centers to AWS. But the impact on margins and revenue from sort of the runoff of the licenses and as those -- as that business continues to shift towards a higher percentage coming in the SaaS. And we said, really, by the end of -- both of those have impacts over the next couple of years. But we think that sort of that inflection point where licenses or the runoff of the remaining licenses or the shift of those into SaaS model no longer has a negative impact on margins because we have built up that run rate of subscription revenues, and we really believe that 2023 is sort of the trough on margins. And that after that -- and part of that is the lessening of the impact of the mix shift. So what we're seeing this year is pretty much in line with how we looked at the estimated mix going in. But we do expect that percentage at 80% to continue to grow. Yes. There is some lumpiness in the growth in ARR around -- as there is with our license and our bookings. We do expect for the full year licenses to decline and to be down likely sort of in the mid-single digits. And we expect subscription revenues to grow in the 25% to 30% range. And we would expect that new ARR would also grow in that 25% to 30% range. Not that I'm aware of. I think it's just a little bit of the lumpiness of the structure of the contracts, but not aware of anything that's particularly notable in terms of a difference from the prior year. Yes, I still think that, again, we still have a big base of maintenance, that a lot of that cash flow comes in Q3. So still expect that the progression will probably be similar to what we saw last year that Q3 would be, by far, the peak of cash flow, but Q4 should be relatively strong as well. But I think we still sort of follow the historical seasonality of cash flow. Our CapEx should be fairly consistent across the year. And the -- obviously, the recurring revenues with a much bigger base of transaction-based revenues helped smooth out the seasonality around that piece of our revenues. Yes. Duration is certainly a part of it. This quarter with the 3.4 years duration of our new subscription deals is much closer to what we're trying to drive to with sort of a standard of 3 years on most of our new subscription deals. So that certainly played a part in it. It's down from 4 years last year. And I think that also would be the lowest average duration we've seen over, call it, the last year or so. So I think that's playing a part in it. Bookings growth on an organic basis was still pretty solid at north of -- I think, the number was 14%. So duration certainly would be one of the factors there. But we feel pretty good about bookings growth actually being on an organic basis being ahead of where revenue growth currently is. Again on maintenance because those bookings come in when those renewals happen in Q2. Q2 typically is a stronger seasonal bookings quarter just because of where the maintenance falls and Q1 is pretty light there. So it's -- the subscription bookings were certainly the strongest point of the bookings growth this quarter, which is what we like to see. The offset really is the annual increases. I mean most of our maintenance agreements, the vast majority of them are annual agreements, so renewable annually with pricing adjustments annually. And historically, I'd say, across most of our customers, we're typically in the 4% to 5% annual increase on a pretty consistent basis over a number of years, and that hasn't changed. So yes, on the base, we typically get that, at least low single-digit annual increase. We, as you know, have very, very low attrition in terms of customers leaving us. In terms of dollars, probably around 1%. And then certainly, as fewer new customers come to us in a license model with maintenance that there's smaller and smaller number of new adds, but we have that 20% of our new business that is coming in license does generate new maintenance. And then the bigger impact that is likely to accelerate over the coming years is the flips or the migrations of those on-premise customers that are currently paying us maintenance moving into the cloud and shifting to subscription. So it's a change in what revenue line they come on, but does typically, rough numbers, double what they're paying us over maintenance. So while we lose maintenance revenues, we gain close to 2x that on the subscription line."

            "content": "Thank you, Jamie, and welcome to our call. With me today is Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. First, I'd like for Brian to give the safe harbor statement. Next, I'll have some comments on our quarter, and then Brian will review the details of our results. I'll end with some additional comments, and then we'll take questions. Brian? Thanks, Brian. Our first quarter results surpassed our expectations and provided a very strong start to 2022. Total revenues grew approximately 55% with robust organic growth of 12.8%, the highest in 20 quarters. NIC continued to perform well in the first quarter, with core revenue growth of 13%, excluding COVID-related revenues. NIC's growth was boosted by revenues under the new statewide payments contract in Florida and in particular, by revenues associated with corporate filings with the Department of State that are concentrated in the first quarter. NIC's COVID-related revenues were in line with our expectations at $20.6 million. Recurring revenues comprised 79.5% of our quarterly revenues and were led by 140% growth in subscription revenues. On an organic basis, subscription revenues grew a robust 33.8%, reflecting both our accelerating shift to the cloud and growth in transaction-based revenues. We have now achieved greater than 20% subscription revenue growth in 57 of the last 65 quarters. We're particularly pleased with our strong revenue growth even as we saw an acceleration of the shift in our new software contract mix from licenses to SaaS. In Q1, 80% of our new software contract value was SaaS compared to 66% in Q1 last year. As we outlined on our last earnings call, while our move to the cloud builds long-term value, margins compressed in Q1, reflecting the new business mix shift, the inclusion of NIC and in particular, their COVID-related revenues, as well as expenses related to the cloud transition. As a result, our non-GAAP operating margin declined 250 basis points year-over-year to 24.3% but increased 70 basis points sequentially from Q4 of 2021. We continue to be very pleased with NIC's performance and with the growing pipeline of joint opportunities for Tyler and NIC. During the first quarter, NIC successfully extended our enterprise contract in Alabama. And in April, we extended our enterprise agreement with New Jersey. NIC also signed a new 5-year SaaS deal with the State of Mississippi to provide our NIC cannabis licensing platform valued at approximately $4.3 million. We continue to experience success with sell-through deals of Tyler products through NIC's state relationships. In Q1, those deals included sales of our data and insights platform to the state of Vermont and our entellitrak platform for Veterans Affairs in Alabama. We also signed agreements for NIC's payments platform with existing Tyler clients in Hillsboro County, Florida; Montgomery County, Maryland; and Glendale, California. Our largest new deal in the quarter was a SaaS arrangement with the San Diego Association of Governments for Enterprise ERP powered by Munis solution, along with our data and insight solution valued at approximately $4.9 million, win five notable SaaS deals, each with a total contract value greater than $2 million with Glen County, Georgia for our enterprise assessment and tax powered by IAS World Solution; the cities of Rialto, California and Alamagordo, New Mexico for our enterprise ERP powered by Munis; and enterprise permitting and licensing powered by EnerGov; and the cities of Mansfield and Burson in Texas for our enterprise ERP powered by Munis solution. Our largest license deal in Q1 was a $2.7 million agreement with the Utah Department of Public Safety, our first public safety deployment in the state of Utah. The deal includes enterprise law enforcement records, mobile, field mobile, enforcement mobile and public safety analytics.  We also signed four other notable license arrangements in the quarter, each with a total contract value -- than $1 million with the St. Johns County property appraiser in Florida for our enterprise assessment and tax powered by IAS World; the city of Elmhurst, Illinois for our enterprise ERP powered by Munis solution, St. Mary's County government in Maryland for our enterprise public safety, powered by New World and Data and insight solutions, and the city of Virginia Beach, Virginia for our enforcement mobile powered by Brazeau solution. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our updated guidance for 2022. Thanks, Brian. I'm very pleased with our first quarter performance and our outlook for the year. Activity in our public sector market continues to trend positively, and we are well positioned to take advantage of the continued strength in our market. We remain on track with our strategic initiatives, including our development projects to optimize our products for more efficient deployment in the cloud and our cloud-first approach to sales, which we believe will create significant long-term value for clients and shareholders alike. Our balance sheet and cash flow remained very strong and we continue to be opportunistic with regard to capital allocation. We're excited about the acquisition of US eDirect in February, which significantly expands our outdoor recreation portfolio, allowing us to offer an extensive all-in-one outdoor recreation solution that will seamlessly integrate with our NIC payments platform. While we continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities, we are heavily focused on the integration and execution around the acquisitions we've completed over the last 2 years, making the bar on new acquisitions at this time relatively high. Last Thursday marked the 1-year anniversary of our landmark acquisition of NIC. As I reflect on the acquisition and all that we have accomplished as a -- entity over the last 12 months, I can truly say that it has exceeded our expectations, which were already high. Our teams have come together as one unified organization and our collective excitement about the opportunities that the combination unlocks has continued to grow. We've integrated our payments teams and have refined our strategy to pursue what we believe is a huge TAM in government payments. As we've discussed, we're winning new business with sell-throughs into our respective client bases. In this quarter, we doubled the number of sell-through opportunities in our pipeline. We look forward to continuing to report on our progress in the second year of our combination. The challenges of today's labor market continue to be an area of significant focus for us. While we added 195 new team members in the first quarter, we currently have a higher-than-normal number of open positions. Although our open positions have a short-term positive impact on margins, we have aggressive hiring plans for the balance of the year to support our growth. Finally, we're extremely excited to host clients live and in person at Connect, our annual user conference, which will take place in Indianapolis for May 15 through May 18. With that, we'd like to open up the line for Q&A. Yes. Sure, Jonathan. And I think that's right. The markets right now are really strong. I'd say they're probably about as strong as I can remember. And our competitive position is really high, really across the board. You're right, we pre-COVID, we went through a significant period of elevated investments, and I think that's really paying off right now across all of our lines of business. Our win rates are strong. Our final rates are strong. It's really setting us up well for the next few years. And so I appreciate that comment. Yes, I think that's going real well, Jonathan. AWS is going to be a great long-term partner for us. We're already starting to move customers into the AWS cloud. We're working on plans right now to exit the Tyler data centers over the next couple of years and move them into AWS. They're a great partner. Where we're going with our cloud initiative lines up well, our cultures line up well. And our clients see that. Our clients see the benefits. They see the future road map that we've laid out and our clients are excited about it. Yes. I think, Pete, I'd just add that the thing about the Secretary State filings in Florida is it was a little bit somewhat unexpected as we entered the year. And I think it shows the potential of not just the Florida payment contracts and extending it beyond what I think probably NIC's original expectations were before they joined Tyler, but really the things that we can do across the country. And so while there's some seasonality to that, to me, it's an exciting indicator things that we can achieve down the road. Yes. I'd say as it relates to headcount, Pete, is probably a little bit below, and that's been really the case for probably at least a year or so. And my sense is that's the case generally across all industries right now. There's certainly a lot of labor market challenges. It certainly helps with margins in the short term. We want to be a little more aggressive, and we are aggressive. We are -- our HR department is working hard but -- so that we can deliver on a lot of the sales, the good sales activity that we've had over the long run, being able to get these installations deployed, continuing to keep our customers happy is going to require getting some of those heads in. Yes, Josh, it's a good question. It's, at times -- it's hard to sometimes to isolate. I think what I would say -- I'd go back to my comment to Jonathan's question about the budgets overall. From what I'm seeing right now, our clients' budgets are as healthy as they've ever been. Leading up 2018, 2019, the economy was really good. The budgets were really strong. There was an anticipation of negative COVID impact that prediction really didn't come through. And since then, as you mentioned, we've lumped on a lot of stimulus money. In addition to that, and I think I mentioned on the last call, perhaps we all see what's going on out there in the real estate market and the boom that's going on there, which is driving appraisals and valuations up, which further than drives up assessments and property taxes, which is a big funder of a lot of our -- particularly with our local government clients. We're seeing the impact. It's sometimes hard to track individual deals. But we're certainly seeing the impact and the fact that I think it's a very robust market right now. You got something? Yes, sure. And I'd say the answer to that is yes, we're really good complement. I mean, the outdoor market is something that we believe is a good growth opportunity. We believe the TAM is there. There is demand for this sort of all-in-one solution. And really what NIC brought was really a first-in-class solution around hunting and fishing licenses and US eDirect really was a leading outdoor reservation platform. So it sort of combines that into creating, as we said, sort of an all-in-one opportunity. We've seen the pipeline already just this year grow significantly in that space. And I think one of the things that we're excited about is not just combining the NIC technology with US eDirect, which is also, by the way, deployed in AWS, but our ability to go out and sell it. So it's a solution -- when you talk about outdoor reservations and stuff, it's not just going in the states, which will be through NIC sales channels, but we also have the ability to go sell it more locally through some of Tyler's sales channels. Yes. I think, generally speaking, what we're seeing on enterprise ERP is the market is, and the deals that we're signing each quarter, really reflects sort of pre-COVID levels. So that's very encouraging. We have identified a handful of deals that are specific -- that can be tied specifically to the ARPA funding and things like that. But again, sometimes it's hard to know specifically where a jurisdiction, how they allocate those funds. We don't normally sort of get that 1:1 rate. Our growth -- our deal volume is enterprise ERP is good. We're really focusing on expanding payments through that customer base. As you mentioned, we're focusing on expanding our flips, which are continuing to increase at a faster rate quarter-by-quarter. Our installed client sales continue to be really strong there. So it's a very healthy business that's continuing to grow, and we're pretty pleased with the outlook. Well, we're -- I guess I'd step back and just say, yes, we're excited about all of our cross-sell opportunities through the NIC base. The Utah deal was a great win for our public safety team. Very large contract. I think it's early to say that -- I mean, obviously, part of our sales plan is to repeat these types of wins. That's part of our playbook. It may be -- to say that those can happen relatively quickly. Sales cycles still sort of take a life of their own, but we're excited the way our teams are working together across all of our products and the potential with NIC. Yes, I would say we're a year now into the NIC acquisition. Standing here a year later, I'm more than pleasantly surprised at how the teams are working and the number of opportunities that have already surfaced. Stepping back, looking at maybe a 20,000-foot level, we may still be in the first inning of this deal. We've got a long way to go. We're still learning about each other. We're still learning -- while we spent a lot of time last year educating both teams on products and sales channels and the ways to go about addressing the market, I think we're just barely scratching the surface of what we can achieve together. Yes. I would say that on one level, it's -- I've talked about the robust market. I think my comment there would be, some of it is still just release of pent-up demand during COVID. I do think we're seeing a little bit maybe quicker sales cycles in some of our inside sales and that may be a little bit more directly tied to some ARPA funding. But we're also -- one thing I didn't mention earlier is one of the things that we're doing across Tyler is we're being pretty proactive about marketing the availability of the ARPA funds and how our clients can use them. We've done several webinars and podcasts and blogs and e-mails to sort of help stimulate that use and hopefully direct some of it to Tyler. Yes. No, I understand your question, and you're right. So coming into this year, and we announced, I think maybe in Q3 of last year, certainly on the Q4 call, our enterprise ERP powered by Munis solutions are now really just being offered in a SaaS model. I have made the comment that you should expect to see more of our core flagship products move in that direction including probably one later this year and moving into next year. I'm a little hesitant to outline some of that right now because we haven't even notified all of our customers yet of our future strategy. Our clients generally know that we are going cloud first. That's not a surprise to anyone. But in terms of specific time lines, I'd rather sort of keep that messaging within us right now until we're ready to do that. But that's our strategic direction. It's not a surprise to anyone. We're making progress on our cloud initiatives, and we will reach the point generally across our portfolio with perhaps the exception of parts of public safety, which will be a little bit -- which will be market driven. And then we talked before, they've been a little bit slower to move to the cloud. Yes. And then I'd probably add to that, Charlie, I think we mentioned earlier, the COVID -- the TourHealth revenues out of NIC should -- our expectation is those pretty much wind down in Q2. I'm sorry -- yes. So yes, Charlie, I think right now, our priority is to pay down the debt, particularly as interest rates have continued to increase. We already talked about readjusting our plan for the higher rates and it costs us an extra $0.06. So that's our priority. We're continuing to do everything else we've always done, which is be opportunistic, look at our internal R&D. We continue to look at acquisitions. With the softness in the market, we'll continue to evaluate repurchase opportunities versus the paying down the debt. But I'd say right now, that's our priority. Just as a reminder, as Brian mentioned, we paid down $415 million of the debt. And of our outstanding debt, about $600 million is sitting in a convertible, which right now is about 45%, and that's at a fixed rate 25 basis points that's not maturing until '26. I'd like to see us get some of that bank debt paid down. But again, if opportunities present themselves, we'll probably move on those as well. I'd say generally, they're pretty balanced. Like I mentioned earlier, our reprise ERP, powered by Munis solution, that market is -- we're seeing the deal volume that's similar to pre-COVID. Really, at the lower end, we continue to see deal volume and growth higher than pre-COVID, which is great. And that's our ERP Pro, our old [incode] solution. If you look at our appraisal and tax solutions, we started to see some increasing sales momentum late last year, and we're seeing that start to continue. You look at Courts & Justice, we've made a number of acquisitions in the last couple of years, and we're pretty bullish on expanding those markets, whether it's our vend engine, our corrections. There's a lot of opportunity there. We're seeing that. We're also -- I think we sort of referenced it, our e-filing is back to prepandemic levels, which is good to see. And public safety continues to do the things that we expected to do with out of these investments. They signed another large deal. Their competitive position is strong. They've done a good job with their clients on some of these new products, getting them live, getting them settle, getting referenceable. So across the board, it's pretty good across the board, maybe it's a few places a little bit better than others, but generally speaking, I'd say it's pretty healthy. I'd say there that for the year, I think our licenses are sort of on track with our plan. They were a little higher in Q1 than our expectations. Some of that comes through our robust inside sales. Some of those -- or tend to be -- have trended to be more license than our expectation. Our new business generally is in line with our expectation. I think our licenses outlook for the year is in line, but it was higher in Q1, which obviously helped with our organic growth number. Yes. So there's a lot there, Keith, to talk about. We mentioned, I think, in our last earnings call that part of our OP pressure this year was the fact that we were generally increasing our budget for employee compensation a little higher than we had traditionally. The labor market challenges are out there. Our turnover is higher than historic. But from what we see and the studies that we look at, we still believe it's lower than most in the tech industry. The competition is stuff out there right now. I sometimes look at it, however, in terms of -- when I think about external factors, be it inflation or recession concerns or the labor market is what do we do within Tyler? How does it impact us versus our competitors? And people like to come to work here. We've got a good culture. I like to think that -- some of these things may disproportionately affect some of our maybe perhaps smaller competitors as it relates to inflation and pricing. As you know, most of our agreements or annual agreements or multiyear agreements with some the ability with escalators. We have the ability to adjust those -- adjust pricing on our services that we send out there. So I think we're in a position where we can attack inflation -- inflationary pressures. Our people are working hard to staff and hire. We've got -- we've done a lot of business in the last year, and we need to go execute on some of it. And that's part of it is we need to get some people in here to go execute on some of these deals we've sold. Yes. So with the Florida upside in the first quarter around the Secretary of State filings, we anticipated to have the Secretary of State filings, the manner in which the revenue model turned out to be a little bit different than we had anticipated, and we were able to go with the convenience fee as opposed to a per click per payment percentage, and that drove significantly higher dollars to us. My comments are really about the fact that the extension of what we can do with Tyler, we've talked about being able to be in the local markets in Florida. Our ability because of our robust payment engine to be able to do things that certain other payment providers can't do that are in our focus on the government space drives that as you look out towards other states and other localities. But payments is one of our big future growth drivers. It's something that all of our divisions are focusing on. And I think it's something that you're going to see drive growth over time. It's going to -- like a lot of our long-term growth drivers, it will ramp up over time. And if you say, where are we out 5 years from now, we think the market's pretty big. The TAM for payments is, I think, well north of $500 million and we're positioned and are targeting to go get a vast majority of that. And I'd add there, Brent, that while we talk about our flips and our flips continue to increase quarter by quarter, I think our flips are year-over-year, up maybe about 125%. Much like my comment on NIC, we're still in the very, very early innings on flips. That's a long road map and a long tailwind. And as our products continue to get more cloud efficient, more cloud optimized, as we as we develop more systems to make that a little bit more of an efficient process, that's something that will be a tailwind for the next several years. Great. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to myself or Brian Miller. Have a great day."

Fourth quarter results reflected a strong finish to a pivotal year in our cloud transition and return to year-over-year operating margin expansion. We achieved our key objectives for the year, and earnings and cash flow surpassed our expectations with free cash flow representing a new high for a fourth quarter. Recurring revenues grew 8% and comprised 84% of our total revenues. Our SaaS mix continued to accelerate and comprised 89% of Q4 new software contract value. The quarter was also highlighted by SaaS revenue growth of 21.7% and represented our 12th consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more, exceeding our near term growth expectations of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025. Transaction based revenues were impacted by seasonal trends and contractual changes in one of our state enterprise agreements that included a change from a gross to a net revenue model for payments. I want to remind you of the significance of pass through merchant fees in our payments business and how they impact both revenue growth and margins. The majority of our payment processing arrangements are accounted for under a gross model where we charge a fixed percentage of the transaction and are responsible for the merchant and interchange fees. Under this model, merchant fees are reflected in both revenues and expenses with the resulting drag on margins. In a smaller number of arrangements, the client is responsible for paying merchant fees directly and we record revenues on a net basis. We do not control which model the client chooses, although, we expect that the majority of payment processing contracts will continue to be under the gross model. Throughout the year and during the fourth quarter, we continued to make solid progress with key initiatives around our cloud transition. We started to realize the benefits of our cloud optimization efforts as we released cloud efficient versions of many of our products and began to experience hosting cost improvements as we scaled our deployments at AWS. These efficiencies related to our cloud operations contributed significantly to our year-over-year operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter. Cloud adoption with both new and existing on premises clients continued at an accelerated pace across our product portfolio. In the fourth quarter, the number of on premises migrations or flips signed was a new fourth quarter high at 92. The increased SaaS adoption in 2023 was particularly notable in the public safety market where we have seen a significant increase in SaaS adoption with new clients as well as signing our first flips. We also signed an expanded multiyear strategic collaboration agreement with Amazon Web Services to further enable the growing demand for our clients and public sector agencies to move to the cloud. Under the expanded agreement, we will jointly expand our framework and share programs to streamline migrations from on premises solutions to our next generation cloud applications. This is another major step forward in making the cloud accessible for our clients, further improving business continuity, continuous delivery and enhanced security. It also supports our Tyler 2030 vision to complete our transition to the cloud. The public sector market remains very healthy as evidenced by our elevated levels of RFPs and sales demo activity. Our pipeline reflects the benefits of a heightened level of sales collaboration across our division, driving strong upsell, cross sell and multi-suite deal momentum. Additionally, we continue to build sales synergies across Tyler with our integrated payments team as we execute our unified payment strategy. I'd like to highlight some of our significant fourth quarter wins. Our new transaction based contracts included a landmark win with the California Department of Parks and Recreation for our integrated outdoor recreation platform. This transaction based eight year contract is the largest transaction based arrangement in Tyler's history. This self funded contract, which is provided at no cost to California taxpayers, is valued at an estimated $175 million and includes two one year renewal options. It extends our existing relationship under our 2016 agreement, formerly as US eDirect, with enhanced functionality to add Tyler's end to end payment solution, enabling everything from reservations booking to payment processing. We are honored to be chosen to have such a key role in managing the nation's largest state park system. We also added to our growing footprint in outdoor recreation with a multiyear transaction based contract with the Wyoming State Parks and a SaaS arrangement with the City of Miami, Florida. We continue to execute on cross sell opportunities through our digital solutions, formerly NIC, state enterprise agreements that enable enhanced resident engagement across multiple public sector services. We signed two contracts under our state enterprise agreement in Mississippi as part of our newly launched resident engagement platform using Tyler's MyCivic platform. Working with the Mississippi Attorney General, we launched the Mississippi Access to Maternal Assistance mobile app, which includes the program's Web site and MyCivic platform to bridge access to public and private services across the state. We also signed an agreement with the Mississippi Department of Mental Health to develop a mobile application on our MyCivic platform that will allow the agency to provide useful mental health information to Mississippians affected by mental illness. We continue to build momentum in the public safety market with strong fourth quarter contract activity. Significant contracts included several competitive wins against a key competitors, making 2023 our most successful new business year in public safety since we acquired New World Systems in 2015. We also experienced a significant increase in SaaS adoption of our public safety solutions with SaaS comprising 46% of our fourth quarter public safety deals. Existing on premises public safety clients are also showing heightened interest in moving to the cloud, and three public safety clients signed contracts in the fourth quarter to flip to the cloud. The City of Klamath Falls, Oregon embraced the cloud first strategy signing a contract for a SaaS deployment for integrated enterprise public safety suite, which includes the full suite of our public safety solutions, including Enterprise Records Management, Jail Manager, Fire, electronic patient care reporting, civil process, e-citations and analytics. Our recent contract signed in Q2 with the Oregon State Patrol serve as a strong reference for this competitive win. Other notable public safety deals included a SaaS contract with Santa Rosa County, Florida and on-premises contracts with Rensselaer County and Wayne County both in New York. We also had a significant cross sell win under our state enterprise agreement in Arkansas for a public safety solution for Pulaski County, Arkansas. In the court space, we signed our first SaaS flip of a statewide court system with the Idaho Supreme Court. This five year agreement includes migrating the court's 44 counties and 200 courtrooms from on premises deployments to our SaaS offering. Our largest new SaaS deal in the quarter was with the state of North Carolina where we extended the term of our existing court SaaS agreement for five years and expanded the agreement to add our solution for appellate courts. We also achieved key operational milestones in Courts & Justice during the quarter, including the successful go live of our Enterprise Justice solution with the LA County Criminal Courts. This completed the countywide rollout across 35 court locations in the nation's largest court. With our application platform, we secured a key SaaS win with the Virginia Department of Education to upgrade its enterprise state regulatory system and modernize its citizen portal. The system will support the management of Virginia's child daycare programs, which are transitioning from the Department of Social Services to the DOE. During the fourth quarter, we also signed 172 new payments deals, bringing the total to 600 for the year. We also signed a new state enterprise contract in Maryland following a competitive rebid of our expiring contract as well as an extension of our Oklahoma enterprise agreement. Finally, as noted on our last call, we completed the acquisitions of ARInspect and ResourceX in October for a combined purchase price of approximately $37 million in cash and stock. We're pleased to see multiple early wins for application platform leveraging field operations and inspection capabilities that came to us through ARInspect. Now, I'd like Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2024.\nBrian Miller: Thanks Lynn. Total revenues for the quarter were $480.9 million, up 6.3%. Organic revenue growth, which also excludes COVID related revenues in 2022, was 6.1%. The fourth quarter of 2022 included $3.5 million of revenues from COVID related initiatives at our Digital Solutions division, all of which ended in 2022. Subscription revenues increased 11.4% and organically rose 10.8%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew 21.7% to $141 million and grew organically 21.2%, which is consistent with our near term growth expectations of 20% CAGR and SaaS revenues through 2025. Keep in mind that there is often a lag from the signing of a new SaaS deal or a flip to the start of revenue recognition that can vary from one to several quarters. Because of this as well as the timing of SaaS renewals and related price increases, SaaS revenue growth, both year-over-year and sequentially, may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Transaction revenues grew 3% to $145.1 million and were up 2.1% on an organic basis. The lower growth rate in transaction revenues reflects in part the change from gross to net revenue recognition for payments under one of our state enterprise agreements. Just a reminder here about the seasonality of our transaction revenues. Our seasonality is really driven by two primary factors; State determined deadlines, such as corporate filing deadlines or hunting seasons; and the number of business days. Even with online transactions, we see a decline in volumes over the holidays. Q2 is typically our highest volume quarter with peak outdoor seasons along with tax season deadlines followed by Q1 due to the high volume of corporate filing services with Q1 deadlines. Q4 will always lag with the holiday seasons, which lead to fewer business days. While the smaller impact revenues from driver history records are also stronger in the first half of the year. The sequential decline in transaction revenues this quarter reflects that typical seasonality. SaaS deals comprised approximately 89% of our Q4 new software contract value compared to 86% last year. Professional services revenue declined 3.7% due to the absence of COVID related revenues and was flat organically. As Lynn noted earlier, public sector demand remains healthy and we're pleased with the strength of our new contract signings in Q4. During the quarter, we added 156 new SaaS arrangements and converted 92 existing on premises clients to SaaS with the total contract value of approximately $137 million, an increase of 39% over last year. In Q4 of last year, we added 140 new SaaS arrangements and hit 82 on premises conversions with a total contract value of approximately $99 million. Also note that while the contract with the California State Parks includes our SaaS solution for outdoor recreation, it is not included in the new SaaS contract value, because it is funded completely from transaction fees. Overall, our pace of on premises conversions to SaaS continued at a steady pace with 338 flips in 2023. More importantly, the total contract value associated with flips increased to $92 million compared to $76 million last year. As we've discussed, conversions are a significant growth driver over the next several years as we accelerate the pace of flips. Including transaction revenues, expansions with existing clients and professional services, total bookings increased 21.2% on an organic basis. Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.61 billion, up 7.9% and organically grew 7.1%. Operating margins were better than expected despite pressure from our ongoing cloud transition. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 22.3%, up 70 basis points from Q4 last year. As Lynn discussed earlier, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins as they are passed through to clients and are included in both revenues and cost of revenues. We paid merchant fees of approximately $35 million in Q4 and approximately $157 million for the full year of 2023. Both cash flows from operations and free cash flow reached new highs for our fourth quarter at $147.4 million and $134.4 million respectively. Cash flow in the quarter was impacted by approximately $15 million of incremental cash taxes due to Section 174. And for the full year, those incremental cash taxes were approximately $127 million. We continue to prioritize repayment of term debt as a use of our cash flow. And in Q4, we reduced our term debt by $90 million, bringing our total repayments for the year to $345 million. We ended Q4 with total outstanding debt of $650 million and cash and investments of approximately $183 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 0.97 times trailing 12 month pro forma EBITDA. Our 2024 guidance is as follows. We expect total revenues will be between $2.095 billion and $2.135 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8%. We also expect that merchant fees will be down slightly and that implied growth, excluding merchant fees, would be approximately 90 basis points higher. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.17 and $5.37 and may vary significantly due to the impact of discrete tax items on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $8.90 and $9.10. We expect our free cash flow margin will be between 17% and 19%, including the impact of incremental cash taxes related to Section 174 of approximately $50 million. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q4 earnings deck posted on our Web site. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. We entered 2024 with tremendous optimism and confidence in the year ahead and beyond as we execute our mid to long term strategy supporting our Tyler 2030 vision. We expect to return to a trajectory of consistent operating margin expansion in 2024 as we increasingly realize the benefits of our cloud optimization initiatives and execute our planned exits from our two proprietary data centers in 2024 and 2025. We continue to leverage our competitive strengths and demonstrate the value of our deep domain expertise across the broadest, most integrated offerings that are uniquely focused on the public sector, while empowering our clients who serve the public through Tyler's next generation cloud applications. Finally, we are proud to be recognized by Government Technology Magazine as a GovTech 100 company for 2024. This marks our 8th consecutive year being recognized for our work in making a difference for government through technology.  Now, we'd like to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Wong of Oppenheimer and Co.\nKen Wong: I wanted to maybe just touch on the accelerating pace of flips going into '24. On one hand, like I think that's a fantastic initiative. You guys are also dialing back or at least decelerating the pace of sales and marketing growth or SG&A, I guess, I'm modeling maybe mid single digits. I guess, what's the confidence in being able to accelerate that pace while also maybe not leaning in as aggressively on the sales and marketing side?\nBrian Miller: Well, really, a lot of the movement in flip is -- doesn't require a lot of sales and marketing efforts. A lot of that is done through our inside sales organization through our existing client relationship managers, and it doesn't require a great deal of increase in sales and marketing expenses. And generally, we feel like that sort of mid single digit growth in sales and marketing like a lot of [Technical Difficulty] more cross selling [Technical Difficulty] more synergies across our sales organization, put more products in the same sales rep bags. So those two factors don't really conflict with each other. But we believe the resources we have in place really are sufficient to drive the pace of flips we expect to see over the next several years.\nLynn Moore: Just a follow-up on that. I mean when we outlined our Tyler 2030 vision, we obviously -- we've got some goals around flips over the next six, seven years. And we also have goals on on some of our G&A initiatives. So I think those are both tracking right now in line and with our expectations going forward.\nKen Wong : And then just a quick follow-up in terms of the hosting efficiencies. I guess would you say we've peaked in terms of kind of extracting the efficiencies there or is there still a little room to go?\nLynn Moore: I think there's still room to go and there's a lot that goes into that. We're continuing to optimize our products and find ways for them to run more efficiently. On the other side of it, we're also seeing -- continuing to make strides in our version consolidation, particularly with our major product lines. We've seen, over the last 12 months, significant version consolidation in two of our larger flagship products, and that will continue to contribute efficiencies as we go forward, as well as with some of our other products that are out there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Lynn, maybe for you, just along those lines. I was wondering if you could just go one level deeper into the latest agreement with AWS. And maybe the question is, how does the new agreement maybe change what you had previously and how can that sort of continue to support the profitability growth that we're clearly seeing?\nLynn Moore: As you know, we signed an extension that now runs through the end of 31, which runs through our Tyler 2030 initiative, which is great. It obviously just further deepen those relationships. We've made certain commitments to AWS around migrating our existing Tyler clients, our net new clients into AWS. AWS has also made commitments back to us around certain pricing commitments, innovation, marketing, things like that. I'm not really at liberty to go into the specifics of what those details and those commitments and pricing concessions are. But what I can say is that AWS has been a great partner for us. I couldn't be more happy with the relationship that we started in the fall of 2019. And this extension, I think, further embraces that. They're very collaborative with us and are eager to work with us to help us find ways to lower our costs. So they are a true partner. Similarly, we view our clients in the public sector as partners, that's why they view us. And I think part of the difference also in our relationship now is it's more mature. And we're a lot farther along in our cloud journey than we were when we first signed it. If you remember when we first signed the agreement, we were still trying to figure out how our products would really operate in AWS, and we spent a long time trying to just figure out the cost of just moving simply lift and shift. And now we've transformed and we've done all that and it's how can we make them run even more efficiently in the public cloud. So great partner, excited that they're on this journey with us for the next at least eight years.\nSaket Kalia: That sounds like a win-win for everybody. I'll stick to the one follow-up and Brian, maybe it's for you. Great to see Tyler reach the 17% to 19% free cash flow target. I think one year ahead of schedule, and you correct me there if I'm wrong. I know we're not speaking to 2025 necessarily on this call, but maybe conceptually, how do you sort of think about free cash flow margin expansion versus EBIT margin expansion? Should those two things move largely in the same range or is there any reason to think that one should expand faster than the other? Does that make sense?\nBrian Miller: Yes. I think in the near term, they likely expand in the same range. And particularly, I think you see that in 2024, most likely, especially because we still, although, it's lessening and lessens over the next several years, there still is an impact of the Section 174 change. It was $127 million impact on our free cash flow in 2023. It's about a $50 million impact in 2024 and it will decline again over the next four years after that until it sort of reaches equilibrium. But I think in the longer term, we would expect that free cash flow growth would be higher, especially if you take out that Section 174 impact, because of a couple of things. We've continued to get leverage out of CapEx and especially as we exit our data centers where a significant amount of our CapEx has been focused in recent years as we continue to become more efficient around how we manage office facilities and our other CapEx associated with our business. And actually, you'll see we have lower expectation for CapEx around software development going forward as well. But most importantly, the cash flow characteristics of the recurring revenues, the SaaS revenues paid in advance and create deferred revenue, the transaction revenue is generally getting paid at the time of the transaction. So there aren't big receivables associated with those. So as those businesses grow, those revenue streams grow, they should have the impact of causing our cash flow to grow faster than the EBIT.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Reilly from Needham.\nJoshua Reilly: Overall, the demand environment seems very strong, but the initial revenue guidance for 2024 was a bit below the Street at the midpoint, and implies a little greater acceleration in 2025 to hit the midterm target for revenue of $2.35 billion. How are you thinking about the progression to hit this 2025 target now, given the initial revenue guidance for the year?\nLynn Moore: Josh, right now, I would say I'm confident in both our 2025 and our 2030 projections just from overall what I'm seeing in the business. As Brian remarked or pointed out in the opening remarks, a couple of things impact revenue growth this year, and one really is the flat to slightly declining merchant fee growth. So when you pull out merchant fees, our growth is really more in the closer to mid-9s, probably 93%, 94%, it's about 90 basis points and those tend to fluctuate. And part of that is, as Brian mentioned, due to one of our large state enterprise contracts flipping from the gross to net model. Overall, as you pointed out, I mean, what we're seeing in the markets right now, the demand, the number of new business deals we're signing, our competitive position, wins against really some key large Tier 1 competitors are the things that really give me a lot of confidence. We recently had our national sales meeting really dive deep into sales forecast, not only for the next 12, 24 months, but even beyond. And right now, things look pretty good.\nJoshua Reilly: And then just a quick follow-up. The Idaho Courts deal, that seems like an important deal in terms of being the first. I believe it's the first state to migrate out of the 16 or 17 that you have on-premise case management installations. Do you think this is a tipping point or do you think that the others 16 or 17 states are still a couple of years away from migrating?\nLynn Moore: Yes, I think it's hard to say, Joshua. All of our global submarket\u2019s a little bit different and the courts market, for sure, it's an area where people may be a little reluctant to go first. So getting Idaho there and going, eyes are going to be on it. And I think as we successfully pull off that deal, I do think it will trigger more throughout the courts community. As you know, everything we do is reference business. But particularly in these larger state wide deals our state corp business, I think all the other states are watching Idaho. So we need to do what we do best, which is go and execute on the business and go make it a great experience. And I do think that will be a domino that will ripple throughout the client base.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terrell Tillman of Truist Securities.\nConnor Passarella: This is Connor Passarella on for Terry. I also just wanted to ask one on the Idaho state court deal. First, could you maybe just break down how we should think about this deal playing out in the model, and maybe what the time line looks like for getting a large court system like this live in terms of the courtrooms and the counties and kind of how it all works with getting to cloud?\nBrian Miller: Yes, it's going to take some time for the full impact of this deal. And I think we're going to recognize probably about 50% of the uplift revenue in 2024 and we'll really see the full impact in 2025. All of our courts\u2019 businesses are large projects. We talked about the L.A. criminal courts go live, probably one of the most successful go-lives we've had in Tyler's history. This will mirror that as it will be our first statewide flip. But from a timing perspective, revenues, uplift, all that, we'll get about 50% of it in 2024, and in 2025, we'll have the full run rate.\nLynn Moore: I think about midyear is -- because that midyear is when we expect to start to bring them up into AWS. And that uplift is included in our guidance for the year, but it's a couple of million dollar uplift from what they were paying in maintenance.\nConnor Passarella: And then just on a follow-up. I just wanted to ask one around transaction revenues. Could you maybe just talk a little more about the impact of payments from customers flipping gross to net in the quarter? I think you mentioned the flip in one of the state enterprise agreements. I was just curious on how that impacted overall revenue in that segment?\nBrian Miller: As we've talked about, one of our state contracts actually midyear changed from gross to net. So we had that impact in the second half of this year and it also impacts us in the first half of next year. I think the overall impact for the second half of the year was in the $9 million to $10 million range. The first half of next year, because is, I believe, somewhere in a similar range. And that was probably split between Q3 and Q4 but probably a little bit more of that impact was in Q3, but there was a several million dollar impact on the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt VanVliet of BTIG.\nMatt VanVliet: I guess on the deal with the California Parks division there, you talked about it being exclusively funded through transaction revenue. Maybe just help us think about kind of I guess, not only maybe what the contractual minimums might be there, what's sort of embedded in guidance? How much potential upside is there to what's embedded in guidance? And then maybe more importantly down the road, do you envision other states trying to take on approach more like this, where there's less contracted SaaS revenue and more funded through the program itself?\nLynn Moore: Matt, I'll start and Brian, you may jump in. There are a couple of things that are really exciting about that California State Parks deal. One obviously is it's the largest transaction deal in Tyler's history. The second thing is, as you pointed out, it validates this sort of self funding model. It's not a surprise. Anybody who reads the journal that California has significant deficits and significant budgetary issues right now. And so going to them with a self funded model on this type of contract is really about the only way they can do it. And so again, it validates that model, that part of our business. Because it's self funded, the impact going forward we will be recognizing a lot more expense in 2024. It's actually a little bit of a drag on margins in 2024. But ramps up significantly in '25 and continues that ramp up with margin expansion all the way through the end of the contract in 2031, assuming we don't get the two one year extensions, which if we execute, we think we would get. Brian, do you have anything more to add?\nBrian Miller: Just to say, your point is good, because it isn't a fixed SaaS fee that the transaction revenues are currently an estimate. And we think we have a pretty good idea of what volumes will be, but they may vary from that. And it will -- currently in the plan for this year, we expect a few million dollars of revenues and then it ramps up to that north of $20 million starting and it will be approaching, we think, $20 million next year and then be north of $20 million beyond that as volumes increase and it becomes fully ramped. But yes, it is subject to variances and subject to seasonality as well unlike a regular SaaS contract that is a pro rata revenue recognition every quarter. This will also have seasonality and it's around those as we do in many of our outdoor transaction revenues.\nMatt VanVliet: And then maybe just one clarification around the AWS extension. As you continue to scale that business, are we still at maybe a subscale type of cost relative to the revenue running through that system? Meaning is there still more leverage that can be achieved over the next couple of years through that contract or are we at a level now where it's kind of a pay as you go as you get more scale?\nLynn Moore: No, I think there's still more leverage. And I think generally going forward, we make certain commitments to AWS, and we're making those commitments based on projections. But we're continuing, as I mentioned earlier, to further optimize our products, further reduce our versions. I think the leverage in our cloud operations still has quite a bit of room to go.\nBrian Miller: And I'd point out one other thing about the California contract. As we mentioned on the call, this is a significant expansion of what is already in an existing agreement we have with California under with US eDirect, which we acquired after we acquired NIC. So there are currently annual revenues under that agreement of a little less than $3 million a year. So it's not all incremental revenues but it's a significant increase in the revenues as that has expanded and especially because it now includes payment processing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Kelly [indiscernible] on for Gabriela. Another question on the number of conversions. Conversions have been in kind of the 70 to 100 range per quarter for the past two years. How should we think about the ramp to converting maybe hundreds of customers a quarter, and are you sharing any expectations for a number of flips in 2024?\nLynn Moore: You're right. Kelly, our flips in Q4 were actually up about 12% over Q4 last year. We're not putting out guidance as far as I know, Brian, on specific foot deal count. There's a lot of things that go into that. And as you look out to 2030, the goals we outlined, clearly, we will be ramping up as over time. There's things that go into the flips and a lot of it is, we have to get our customers on more modern versions. And when I talk about our version collapse efforts that have been going on for several years but some of the strides that we've been making, as we continue to make strides on that, it will make -- it will help accelerate the pace of flips going forward.\nBrian Miller: I just would add that it's also important, I think, to look at the size of the flips and the dollar value. So for example, this quarter with the signing the Idaho State Port deal significantly bigger than most of our typical flips. So even though that only counts as one of the 92, the dollars were pretty meaningfully different. And I think in our prepared remarks, we talked about the the size of the increase in the dollar value of the flip contracts. And so in general, I'd expect that as we go forward over the next few years that we'll see more of our larger clients start to move, and so it has a bigger impact on that uplift on the dollar side. So obviously, each flip is not created equal and in general, we've got more of our large clients that are still to be migrated.\nUnidentified Analyst: A quick follow-up. On that version control point, you mentioned last quarter, you had the goal kind of by the end of 2022 or early 2024 of only supporting two of the most recent versions of each product. Where are you at in kind of achieving that goal?\nLynn Moore: We've made a lot of progress, in particular, if you look at our enterprise ERP product, for example, I think at the end of last year, we only had about 23% of that client base on the more modern version at the end of this year, end of 202,3 that was up to 86%. We've made similar strides with our Enterprise Justice solution. So just generally, across the board, we're tracking on that. I'm not sure if I remember saying at the end of 2025, I think it was more 26%. But I think we're actually ahead of the pace that I was thinking about and discussing maybe 18 months, 24 months ago.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird.\nRob Oliver: Lynn, first question is for you. Just around public safety, it must be gratifying just to see the way the business is working after many years through the New World acquisition and now moving to cloud faster than expected. So my question is, it seems like that would be good for Tyler. I just would be curious to hear your view on any potential shift in the competitive landscape that, that might cause, meaning some of your legacy typical competitors that we know in this space, are they properly cloud enabled and conversely, are you seeing new competitors in the market in public safety as these deals shift more to cloud first? And then I had a quick follow-up for Brian.\nLynn Moore: Rob, it's actually -- it's very interesting and to your point, gratifying to see this shift. And we've been anticipating it, but we just didn't know when it was going to happen. I think we mentioned in the opening remarks, about 46% of our Q4 deals were cloud deals in public safety, that's up from 16% in Q2. And as we look out next year, we think it's going to cross 50% and we're sort of planning on a little north of 50%. We're taking an approach that now with public safety as we see the market receptiveness start to be, it's an approach that we took generally with Tyler going back four, five years, which is, going forward, we really want to be leading to the cloud. We think the market is ready. As it relates to competitors, I'm not going to list all the different competitors in public safety. Obviously, we've had a few pop up in the last couple of years that were more cloud native already. Those have been a little bit smaller competitors and they have had their own set of issues to deal with. I think that we are well positioned with our cloud strategy in public safety to take advantage of this market shift. We have new leadership at public safety. If you've been on our Web site, you might have seen a new division president that came on last year, came from outside of Tyler. He's actually has led -- been a part of leading companies through the cloud transition. So it's exciting to have him there, have him up in Troy with the people and really sort of helping lead those efforts. So I like where we are, like where we sit. And to reiterate your words, it's gratifying to see these early results. But a lot of things I'm going to caution is a lot of things to go execute on in the future, but it is good to see this shift starting to happen in public safety.\nRob Oliver: And then Brian, just a question around the R&D expense guide for the year, implying kind of mid-teens year-over-year growth. Can you just talk about what some of the biggest drivers of that are within that R&D line?\nBrian Miller: I mean, I think it continues to be a lot of development around the cloud and our optimization and efficiency efforts around optimizing our products for the cloud. There is a shift from some R&D that was previously being capitalized, especially around some of the cloud projects that will now be expensed. So a lot of it is the same people but now running through expense as opposed to being capitalized. And that's -- obviously, it doesn't change our cash flow but it changes where it turns up on the income statement. So I think it's important to note that we are expecting to drive margin expansion even as we have a movement away from capitalized software development and to more R&D expense.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Strauzer of CJS Securities, Inc.\nCharles Strauzer: Looking at the guidance, especially as it pertains to the quarters. Are there any abnormalities that we should take into account as we build our models out?\nBrian Miller: I don't think there's anything unusual. What we did point out, I think we and the Street are still getting used to the seasonality of the transaction business. And I see when they were a separate public company, certainly we're well versed in that and people who followed them more. But as that impacts Tyler and as we saw this quarter that seasonality around the transactions is pretty significant. I don't expect that to be meaningfully different in 2024, but I think that's the biggest thing to look out for when you look at the quarters.\nCharles Strauzer: And then just more of a macro question for you, given the impact in Congress related to the spending bill. Are you seeing any changes to the sales cycle, especially in your federal business?\nLynn Moore: Charles, not really, not right now. Q1 is probably -- we talked about the situation -- was talking about seasonality. Q1 is probably a little bit slower time in that business as well. And right now, there's no real change in our outlook.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho of William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: Just one question to start out with in terms of operating leverage. Can you maybe walk through for us some of the levers that you have to pull down on for additional operating leverage and some of the moving parts there as we think about your guidance for 2024.\nBrian Miller: I'd say most of the leverage that we're seeing in the model is coming from cloud operations and the things we've talked about, the impact of our -- moving customers out of our data centers and into ABS and our plan to have that first data center close midyear, the benefits we're getting from both scale and improved costs at AWS as we put our new customers there and move existing hosted customers into AWS. So those unit costs become lower. And I think the new agreement with AWS further helps that pricing and leverage that we get as we scale that business. The version consolidation expenses or benefits that Lynn mentioned as we eliminate multiple versions of software and create efficiencies around both support and development. So those cloud operations are really the biggest things driving our margin leverage and those are the things we pointed to at Investor Day that will continue to drive that margin expansion that we expect to see over the next several years as we [Technical Difficulty] 2030 targets.\nLynn Moore: And Jon, I would just add to -- I mean, we're always looking at levers to help make us more efficient. There's a number of internal initiatives going on where we look around and look up and see opportunities for where we can operate internally more efficiently. And there's a number of those things that we're actively acting on, which is, that really sounds weird, we're progressing on.\nJonathan Ho: Just with regards to use of capital, now that your debt payments have put sort of the interest payments under 1 times EBITDA, how should we think about your plans for capital deployment going forward?\nLynn Moore: I think right now, we're still sort of in the same place we've been for the last couple of years. We're even though we will likely pay off the term debt sometime this spring, we still have that $600 million convert that's due in a little more than two years. So my anticipation would be we will be building some cash reserves to be in a position to pay that off rather than renegotiate that at a high bank rate. But at the same time, just like we've done over the last couple of years, we were going to continue to do M&A, particularly where it makes sense strategically and where it's accretive to Tyler. Last year, we did four deals. I think we spent about $75 million, $76 million in cash and stock. Over the last few years, we've spent several hundred million dollars of deals even as we were prioritizing debt paydown. So we still want to prioritize being in a good position when the convertible is due, but at the same time, we'll make smart acquisitions along the way.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Lynn, can you remind us just when, say, contracts that you signed on a SaaS basis, four or five years ago start to come up for renewal. How much of that is the renewal function, an opportunity for cross-sell, upsell for you? Meaning as Munis or ERP deals or SaaS deals come up, is that an opportunity for the salespeople to start talking about additional products or solutions? Meaning we should start to get into a little bit of a renewal cycle over the next couple of years. Just wondering how that works in terms of the uplift, either on a cross or upsell basis?\nLynn Moore: Well, it certainly is another conversation point with the client. So anytime you use a conversation point, there's opportunities for cross sell, upsell. But we've got installed sales teams across all of our organizations and they're reaching out to clients whether they're halfway through their SaaS contract or at the beginning of the SaaS contract or towards the end of it. So I don't know that that's a specific trigger for signify material uplift, but it's another data point that's a contact point with our clients.\nBrian Miller: Flips provide that same opportunity. So we're having conversations with clients about moving a product to the cloud, it gives us an opportunity to have that conversation around other products, maybe in that same suite that they might have on premises from another provider that aren't Tyler products, and the opportunity to bring together an integrated set of solutions while they're moving to the cloud. And I think that as we continue to accelerate the pace of those that we'll continue to look for those opportunities for greater upsells and cross sells.\nKirk Materne: And then I guess, Brian, speaking of flips, obviously, you're guiding maintenance revenue to come down a little bit, which makes tons of sense as you flip people from on-prem to cloud. Can you just remind us the benefits of the uplift of that change? That plays out over a couple of years, meaning you just used the Idaho example. The reason you're not seeing sort of the SaaS revenue get all the benefit of that flip is you're just not going to see it on the income statement until '25. So is that the way we should think about sort of that 1.7% uplift that plays out over 24 months?\nBrian Miller: Yes, there's always a lag. And sometimes we might sign a flip and it starts next quarter and then we see that uplift then. Other times, whether it's because of things that the client needs to do to get internally to get ready to move, whether it's that they need to upgrade to a current version of the software or they need to do things, they've got other internal priorities around their own resources that caused a delay or -- there are a variety of reasons why there can be a lag of from one to multiple quarters. And sometimes it doesn't all happen at once. So they may be flipping multiple applications with us so that they start -- the uplift starts at different times. So I'd say generally, it's not 24 months, but it could be from one to a few quarters before we see the full impact of those from the time we sign it to when we see the impact on the uplift.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin of Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Maybe just the first one. I think last quarter, you talked about wanting to do about 100-plus flips in Q4. Is the right way to think about it that the dollar value of the flips was in line with your expectations, but maybe not the actual number? And then to the point earlier, did some of those get pushed into '24 and now there is the opportunity for a higher dollar value in '24? Just help us understand a little bit about that dynamic.\nBrian Miller: Well, I'd just say when we talk about the number of flips, it's just not that precise. I mean the timing, for example, the Idaho -- signing the Idaho agreement, I think, it was almost three years in the making that we had discussions with them and planning. As Lynn was talking about, it's very complex to move a statewide court system, a lot of planning on their part, a lot of planning on our part and how that all goes and getting comfortable with that, so what quarter that actually gets signed in. Now not all of them are that complex but there's not that much precision around directionally whether it's 92 or 100 or 103. So I'd say that the number was generally in line and the pace at which they're moving is in line with our expectations. The dollar value probably was a bit ahead of, but we expected. So there was a little bit more larger ones in there and the uplifts were a little better than we expected. But it's really hard to be very precise from quarter-to-quarter about what we expect. But we are saying that we are on track with our long term expectation that the number of clients and the dollar volume that will migrate over the next several years as we drive towards that 75% to 85% of our customer base migrated to the cloud by 2030. But just like with new business signings, the exact quarter it falls in is a bit hard to predict, but we're at least in line with our expectations around flips.\nAlex Zukin: And then maybe just as a follow-up. There's currently legislation out there that could reverse some of the R&D tax payments that you had to make. What would be the impact of -- if that act passed on you guys, like how much and when would you see those dollars return?\nBrian Miller: Yes, it's a little hard to tell exactly. I think the bill that's out there now that I believe is passed the house would actually not resend it, it would delay it until 2026. So the incremental taxes that we would -- if that became effective, we would not have to pay in the incremental taxes, the $50 million that we've talked about for this year and lesser numbers going forward. It's a little unclear exactly how and when we would sort of get back the taxes we paid in and incremental taxes we paid in, in 2023, which were $127 million, presumably, those would either offset our normal tax payments to reduce those tax payments over the next year or two or we would file for a refund, which also takes some time. So it's hard to exactly quantify how that would be. But clearly, we wouldn't have those incremental payments going forward. And in some manner, we would look to recover the incremental taxes we paid in either through refunds or lower estimated payments going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum of Northcoast Research.\nKeith Housum: In terms of the backlog, you obviously had a nice jump this quarter year-over-year. How are we thinking about the duration of that backlog? Is it holding relatively stable or is that getting longer?\nBrian Miller: It's generally stable. The part that's expected to be recognized in the next 12 months, I think, is reasonably stable with where it's been. The term of new SaaS deals, for example, this quarter, I think, was very similar. It was a little under four years average term. So it's fairly consistent with what we've seen in recent quarters. And then, of course, the transaction contracts don't really go into backlog. So they don't really affect that number. But on the software side, I'd say it's -- there aren't any meaningful changes in that duration of backlog.\nKeith Housum: Just as a follow-up. There's obviously been a lot of high-profile cybersecurity issues over the past year with public agencies. Have those issues been with agencies that have been primarily on-prem versus the cloud? And if it's been on-prem, are you seeing that as perhaps 1 of the impetuses for the acceleration of the flips?\nLynn Moore: Yes, absolutely. You're spot on on both. And some of these issues have come with obviously some existing clients of ours and it is an opportunity. The cloud is more stable, more secure. We actually have done some deals where clients who might have been resistant to the cloud have flipped, because of some sort of recent ransomware or other issue.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Alexei Gogolev of JP Morgan.\nAlexei Gogolev: Lynn, I recall comments from last year that roughly 20% of your customers have migrated to the cloud. Can you provide an update of that mix as you move towards that target of 75% by 2030?\nLynn Moore: Yes, I think at Investor Day, we said we were somewhere around 15%. And so obviously, we've made progress since then. I'd say we're probably more around the 20% number now in terms of the -- that we've moved. But as I said earlier, we are -- each of our products has a time line and a road map for how they get to that point that converges on our entire customer base being 75% to 85% of the existing on-prem customers converted by 2030. So each product is starting from a different place with their customer base. We've talked about public safety just getting its first flips this past year. Other products are much further along. So everybody has their own road map that converge on that overall number by 2030. And none of those will happen exactly as planned but we have said that we are collectively on track to achieve those targets by 2030.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries of Piper Sandler.\nClarke Jeffries: Lynn, I wanted to go back to something you said about the California contract and the fact that there will be a drag on margins but margin expansion over multiple years. Wondering if you could help explain that. Does that mean that there will be partial volume that moves to you and then full volume over time? Is that just reflective of services implementation costs in the first year that go away and [Multiple Speakers].\nLynn Moore: Yes, let me clarify that. It's a drag on margin in 2024. It will probably equate roughly to maybe a little bit of margin drag in '25, but it's just the ramp-up of revenues versus expenses. So the expenses are more front loaded to get them up and running. As Brian mentioned, we're going from a contract that was a little under $3 million a year in revenues. I think first year, we're expecting it to just slightly more than double that. But you look out in 2025, it goes to $20 million and we expect it to grow all the way up to close to $30 million by the end of the contract. We do expect positive OP starting next year and ramping up significantly each year over time.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of David Unger of Wells Fargo.\nDavid Unger: So back to the flips again, and the topic [Indiscernible] the call, if I would ask is, how should we think about license TCV as a percentage of total TCV on a normalized quarterly run rate path to both the midterm and long term target?\nBrian Miller: We would expect license revenues to -- well, license revenues, which are mostly recognized upfront. So we actually expect low single digit growth this year. But in terms of the mix for them to continue to decline as part of our overall mix, I don't have that sort of broken out year-by-year or quarter-by-quarter. But we would expect that, that percentage of new business that's now in the high 80s to continue to expand incrementally year-by-year until there's very little license revenue left. We do have some third party licenses. We have some license sales back into existing on-prem customers. But really selling very little, only a couple of products where we really sell any licenses at all in the new business market.\nLynn Moore: And I think part of your question was around total contract value, TCV. So that will obviously vary a little bit depending on the SaaS term that we sign. You could use a rule of thumb of what a license deal and a one year maintenance that might drag on that versus sort of what we would project as a normal SaaS deal. So if the SaaS contract was probably only one or two years, it's probably going to have a lower TCV. If it's north of three years, we get to four years, five years, we'd have probably initial higher TCV.\nOperator: We appear to be no further questions at this time. Mr. Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. I'll turn the call back over to you.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Lavesh, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Lynn. Total revenues for the quarter were $480.9 million, up 6.3%. Organic revenue growth, which also excludes COVID related revenues in 2022, was 6.1%. The fourth quarter of 2022 included $3.5 million of revenues from COVID related initiatives at our Digital Solutions division, all of which ended in 2022. Subscription revenues increased 11.4% and organically rose 10.8%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew 21.7% to $141 million and grew organically 21.2%, which is consistent with our near term growth expectations of 20% CAGR and SaaS revenues through 2025. Keep in mind that there is often a lag from the signing of a new SaaS deal or a flip to the start of revenue recognition that can vary from one to several quarters. Because of this as well as the timing of SaaS renewals and related price increases, SaaS revenue growth, both year-over-year and sequentially, may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Transaction revenues grew 3% to $145.1 million and were up 2.1% on an organic basis. The lower growth rate in transaction revenues reflects in part the change from gross to net revenue recognition for payments under one of our state enterprise agreements. Just a reminder here about the seasonality of our transaction revenues. Our seasonality is really driven by two primary factors; State determined deadlines, such as corporate filing deadlines or hunting seasons; and the number of business days. Even with online transactions, we see a decline in volumes over the holidays. Q2 is typically our highest volume quarter with peak outdoor seasons along with tax season deadlines followed by Q1 due to the high volume of corporate filing services with Q1 deadlines. Q4 will always lag with the holiday seasons, which lead to fewer business days. While the smaller impact revenues from driver history records are also stronger in the first half of the year. The sequential decline in transaction revenues this quarter reflects that typical seasonality. SaaS deals comprised approximately 89% of our Q4 new software contract value compared to 86% last year. Professional services revenue declined 3.7% due to the absence of COVID related revenues and was flat organically. As Lynn noted earlier, public sector demand remains healthy and we're pleased with the strength of our new contract signings in Q4. During the quarter, we added 156 new SaaS arrangements and converted 92 existing on premises clients to SaaS with the total contract value of approximately $137 million, an increase of 39% over last year. In Q4 of last year, we added 140 new SaaS arrangements and hit 82 on premises conversions with a total contract value of approximately $99 million. Also note that while the contract with the California State Parks includes our SaaS solution for outdoor recreation, it is not included in the new SaaS contract value, because it is funded completely from transaction fees. Overall, our pace of on premises conversions to SaaS continued at a steady pace with 338 flips in 2023. More importantly, the total contract value associated with flips increased to $92 million compared to $76 million last year. As we've discussed, conversions are a significant growth driver over the next several years as we accelerate the pace of flips. Including transaction revenues, expansions with existing clients and professional services, total bookings increased 21.2% on an organic basis. Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.61 billion, up 7.9% and organically grew 7.1%. Operating margins were better than expected despite pressure from our ongoing cloud transition. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 22.3%, up 70 basis points from Q4 last year. As Lynn discussed earlier, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins as they are passed through to clients and are included in both revenues and cost of revenues. We paid merchant fees of approximately $35 million in Q4 and approximately $157 million for the full year of 2023. Both cash flows from operations and free cash flow reached new highs for our fourth quarter at $147.4 million and $134.4 million respectively. Cash flow in the quarter was impacted by approximately $15 million of incremental cash taxes due to Section 174. And for the full year, those incremental cash taxes were approximately $127 million. We continue to prioritize repayment of term debt as a use of our cash flow. And in Q4, we reduced our term debt by $90 million, bringing our total repayments for the year to $345 million. We ended Q4 with total outstanding debt of $650 million and cash and investments of approximately $183 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 0.97 times trailing 12 month pro forma EBITDA. Our 2024 guidance is as follows. We expect total revenues will be between $2.095 billion and $2.135 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8%. We also expect that merchant fees will be down slightly and that implied growth, excluding merchant fees, would be approximately 90 basis points higher. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.17 and $5.37 and may vary significantly due to the impact of discrete tax items on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $8.90 and $9.10. We expect our free cash flow margin will be between 17% and 19%, including the impact of incremental cash taxes related to Section 174 of approximately $50 million. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q4 earnings deck posted on our Web site. Now, I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn. Well, really, a lot of the movement in flip is -- doesn't require a lot of sales and marketing efforts. A lot of that is done through our inside sales organization through our existing client relationship managers, and it doesn't require a great deal of increase in sales and marketing expenses. And generally, we feel like that sort of mid single digit growth in sales and marketing like a lot of [Technical Difficulty] more cross selling [Technical Difficulty] more synergies across our sales organization, put more products in the same sales rep bags. So those two factors don't really conflict with each other. But we believe the resources we have in place really are sufficient to drive the pace of flips we expect to see over the next several years. Yes. I think in the near term, they likely expand in the same range. And particularly, I think you see that in 2024, most likely, especially because we still, although, it's lessening and lessens over the next several years, there still is an impact of the Section 174 change. It was $127 million impact on our free cash flow in 2023. It's about a $50 million impact in 2024 and it will decline again over the next four years after that until it sort of reaches equilibrium. But I think in the longer term, we would expect that free cash flow growth would be higher, especially if you take out that Section 174 impact, because of a couple of things. We've continued to get leverage out of CapEx and especially as we exit our data centers where a significant amount of our CapEx has been focused in recent years as we continue to become more efficient around how we manage office facilities and our other CapEx associated with our business. And actually, you'll see we have lower expectation for CapEx around software development going forward as well. But most importantly, the cash flow characteristics of the recurring revenues, the SaaS revenues paid in advance and create deferred revenue, the transaction revenue is generally getting paid at the time of the transaction. So there aren't big receivables associated with those. So as those businesses grow, those revenue streams grow, they should have the impact of causing our cash flow to grow faster than the EBIT. Yes, it's going to take some time for the full impact of this deal. And I think we're going to recognize probably about 50% of the uplift revenue in 2024 and we'll really see the full impact in 2025. All of our courts' businesses are large projects. We talked about the L.A. criminal courts go live, probably one of the most successful go-lives we've had in Tyler's history. This will mirror that as it will be our first statewide flip. But from a timing perspective, revenues, uplift, all that, we'll get about 50% of it in 2024, and in 2025, we'll have the full run rate. As we've talked about, one of our state contracts actually midyear changed from gross to net. So we had that impact in the second half of this year and it also impacts us in the first half of next year. I think the overall impact for the second half of the year was in the $9 million to $10 million range. The first half of next year, because is, I believe, somewhere in a similar range. And that was probably split between Q3 and Q4 but probably a little bit more of that impact was in Q3, but there was a several million dollar impact on the quarter. Just to say, your point is good, because it isn't a fixed SaaS fee that the transaction revenues are currently an estimate. And we think we have a pretty good idea of what volumes will be, but they may vary from that. And it will -- currently in the plan for this year, we expect a few million dollars of revenues and then it ramps up to that north of $20 million starting and it will be approaching, we think, $20 million next year and then be north of $20 million beyond that as volumes increase and it becomes fully ramped. But yes, it is subject to variances and subject to seasonality as well unlike a regular SaaS contract that is a pro rata revenue recognition every quarter. This will also have seasonality and it's around those as we do in many of our outdoor transaction revenues. And I'd point out one other thing about the California contract. As we mentioned on the call, this is a significant expansion of what is already in an existing agreement we have with California under with US eDirect, which we acquired after we acquired NIC. So there are currently annual revenues under that agreement of a little less than $3 million a year. So it's not all incremental revenues but it's a significant increase in the revenues as that has expanded and especially because it now includes payment processing. I just would add that it's also important, I think, to look at the size of the flips and the dollar value. So for example, this quarter with the signing the Idaho State Port deal significantly bigger than most of our typical flips. So even though that only counts as one of the 92, the dollars were pretty meaningfully different. And I think in our prepared remarks, we talked about the the size of the increase in the dollar value of the flip contracts. And so in general, I'd expect that as we go forward over the next few years that we'll see more of our larger clients start to move, and so it has a bigger impact on that uplift on the dollar side. So obviously, each flip is not created equal and in general, we've got more of our large clients that are still to be migrated. I mean, I think it continues to be a lot of development around the cloud and our optimization and efficiency efforts around optimizing our products for the cloud. There is a shift from some R&D that was previously being capitalized, especially around some of the cloud projects that will now be expensed. So a lot of it is the same people but now running through expense as opposed to being capitalized. And that's -- obviously, it doesn't change our cash flow but it changes where it turns up on the income statement. So I think it's important to note that we are expecting to drive margin expansion even as we have a movement away from capitalized software development and to more R&D expense. I don't think there's anything unusual. What we did point out, I think we and the Street are still getting used to the seasonality of the transaction business. And I see when they were a separate public company, certainly we're well versed in that and people who followed them more. But as that impacts Tyler and as we saw this quarter that seasonality around the transactions is pretty significant. I don't expect that to be meaningfully different in 2024, but I think that's the biggest thing to look out for when you look at the quarters. I'd say most of the leverage that we're seeing in the model is coming from cloud operations and the things we've talked about, the impact of our -- moving customers out of our data centers and into ABS and our plan to have that first data center close midyear, the benefits we're getting from both scale and improved costs at AWS as we put our new customers there and move existing hosted customers into AWS. So those unit costs become lower. And I think the new agreement with AWS further helps that pricing and leverage that we get as we scale that business. The version consolidation expenses or benefits that Lynn mentioned as we eliminate multiple versions of software and create efficiencies around both support and development. So those cloud operations are really the biggest things driving our margin leverage and those are the things we pointed to at Investor Day that will continue to drive that margin expansion that we expect to see over the next several years as we [Technical Difficulty] 2030 targets. Flips provide that same opportunity. So we're having conversations with clients about moving a product to the cloud, it gives us an opportunity to have that conversation around other products, maybe in that same suite that they might have on premises from another provider that aren't Tyler products, and the opportunity to bring together an integrated set of solutions while they're moving to the cloud. And I think that as we continue to accelerate the pace of those that we'll continue to look for those opportunities for greater upsells and cross sells. Yes, there's always a lag. And sometimes we might sign a flip and it starts next quarter and then we see that uplift then. Other times, whether it's because of things that the client needs to do to get internally to get ready to move, whether it's that they need to upgrade to a current version of the software or they need to do things, they've got other internal priorities around their own resources that caused a delay or -- there are a variety of reasons why there can be a lag of from one to multiple quarters. And sometimes it doesn't all happen at once. So they may be flipping multiple applications with us so that they start -- the uplift starts at different times. So I'd say generally, it's not 24 months, but it could be from one to a few quarters before we see the full impact of those from the time we sign it to when we see the impact on the uplift. Well, I'd just say when we talk about the number of flips, it's just not that precise. I mean the timing, for example, the Idaho -- signing the Idaho agreement, I think, it was almost three years in the making that we had discussions with them and planning. As Lynn was talking about, it's very complex to move a statewide court system, a lot of planning on their part, a lot of planning on our part and how that all goes and getting comfortable with that, so what quarter that actually gets signed in. Now not all of them are that complex but there's not that much precision around directionally whether it's 92 or 100 or 103. So I'd say that the number was generally in line and the pace at which they're moving is in line with our expectations. The dollar value probably was a bit ahead of, but we expected. So there was a little bit more larger ones in there and the uplifts were a little better than we expected. But it's really hard to be very precise from quarter-to-quarter about what we expect. But we are saying that we are on track with our long term expectation that the number of clients and the dollar volume that will migrate over the next several years as we drive towards that 75% to 85% of our customer base migrated to the cloud by 2030. But just like with new business signings, the exact quarter it falls in is a bit hard to predict, but we're at least in line with our expectations around flips. Yes, it's a little hard to tell exactly. I think the bill that's out there now that I believe is passed the house would actually not resend it, it would delay it until 2026. So the incremental taxes that we would -- if that became effective, we would not have to pay in the incremental taxes, the $50 million that we've talked about for this year and lesser numbers going forward. It's a little unclear exactly how and when we would sort of get back the taxes we paid in and incremental taxes we paid in, in 2023, which were $127 million, presumably, those would either offset our normal tax payments to reduce those tax payments over the next year or two or we would file for a refund, which also takes some time. So it's hard to exactly quantify how that would be. But clearly, we wouldn't have those incremental payments going forward. And in some manner, we would look to recover the incremental taxes we paid in either through refunds or lower estimated payments going forward. It's generally stable. The part that's expected to be recognized in the next 12 months, I think, is reasonably stable with where it's been. The term of new SaaS deals, for example, this quarter, I think, was very similar. It was a little under four years average term. So it's fairly consistent with what we've seen in recent quarters. And then, of course, the transaction contracts don't really go into backlog. So they don't really affect that number. But on the software side, I'd say it's -- there aren't any meaningful changes in that duration of backlog. We would expect license revenues to -- well, license revenues, which are mostly recognized upfront. So we actually expect low single digit growth this year. But in terms of the mix for them to continue to decline as part of our overall mix, I don't have that sort of broken out year-by-year or quarter-by-quarter. But we would expect that, that percentage of new business that's now in the high 80s to continue to expand incrementally year-by-year until there's very little license revenue left. We do have some third party licenses. We have some license sales back into existing on-prem customers. But really selling very little, only a couple of products where we really sell any licenses at all in the new business market."

            "content": "Thanks, Hala. Fourth quarter results reflected a strong finish to a pivotal year in our cloud transition and return to year-over-year operating margin expansion. We achieved our key objectives for the year, and earnings and cash flow surpassed our expectations with free cash flow representing a new high for a fourth quarter. Recurring revenues grew 8% and comprised 84% of our total revenues. Our SaaS mix continued to accelerate and comprised 89% of Q4 new software contract value. The quarter was also highlighted by SaaS revenue growth of 21.7% and represented our 12th consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more, exceeding our near term growth expectations of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025. Transaction based revenues were impacted by seasonal trends and contractual changes in one of our state enterprise agreements that included a change from a gross to a net revenue model for payments. I want to remind you of the significance of pass through merchant fees in our payments business and how they impact both revenue growth and margins. The majority of our payment processing arrangements are accounted for under a gross model where we charge a fixed percentage of the transaction and are responsible for the merchant and interchange fees. Under this model, merchant fees are reflected in both revenues and expenses with the resulting drag on margins. In a smaller number of arrangements, the client is responsible for paying merchant fees directly and we record revenues on a net basis. We do not control which model the client chooses, although, we expect that the majority of payment processing contracts will continue to be under the gross model. Throughout the year and during the fourth quarter, we continued to make solid progress with key initiatives around our cloud transition. We started to realize the benefits of our cloud optimization efforts as we released cloud efficient versions of many of our products and began to experience hosting cost improvements as we scaled our deployments at AWS. These efficiencies related to our cloud operations contributed significantly to our year-over-year operating margin expansion in the fourth quarter. Cloud adoption with both new and existing on premises clients continued at an accelerated pace across our product portfolio. In the fourth quarter, the number of on premises migrations or flips signed was a new fourth quarter high at 92. The increased SaaS adoption in 2023 was particularly notable in the public safety market where we have seen a significant increase in SaaS adoption with new clients as well as signing our first flips. We also signed an expanded multiyear strategic collaboration agreement with Amazon Web Services to further enable the growing demand for our clients and public sector agencies to move to the cloud. Under the expanded agreement, we will jointly expand our framework and share programs to streamline migrations from on premises solutions to our next generation cloud applications. This is another major step forward in making the cloud accessible for our clients, further improving business continuity, continuous delivery and enhanced security. It also supports our Tyler 2030 vision to complete our transition to the cloud. The public sector market remains very healthy as evidenced by our elevated levels of RFPs and sales demo activity. Our pipeline reflects the benefits of a heightened level of sales collaboration across our division, driving strong upsell, cross sell and multi-suite deal momentum. Additionally, we continue to build sales synergies across Tyler with our integrated payments team as we execute our unified payment strategy. I'd like to highlight some of our significant fourth quarter wins. Our new transaction based contracts included a landmark win with the California Department of Parks and Recreation for our integrated outdoor recreation platform. This transaction based eight year contract is the largest transaction based arrangement in Tyler's history. This self funded contract, which is provided at no cost to California taxpayers, is valued at an estimated $175 million and includes two one year renewal options. It extends our existing relationship under our 2016 agreement, formerly as US eDirect, with enhanced functionality to add Tyler's end to end payment solution, enabling everything from reservations booking to payment processing. We are honored to be chosen to have such a key role in managing the nation's largest state park system. We also added to our growing footprint in outdoor recreation with a multiyear transaction based contract with the Wyoming State Parks and a SaaS arrangement with the City of Miami, Florida. We continue to execute on cross sell opportunities through our digital solutions, formerly NIC, state enterprise agreements that enable enhanced resident engagement across multiple public sector services. We signed two contracts under our state enterprise agreement in Mississippi as part of our newly launched resident engagement platform using Tyler's MyCivic platform. Working with the Mississippi Attorney General, we launched the Mississippi Access to Maternal Assistance mobile app, which includes the program's Web site and MyCivic platform to bridge access to public and private services across the state. We also signed an agreement with the Mississippi Department of Mental Health to develop a mobile application on our MyCivic platform that will allow the agency to provide useful mental health information to Mississippians affected by mental illness. We continue to build momentum in the public safety market with strong fourth quarter contract activity. Significant contracts included several competitive wins against a key competitors, making 2023 our most successful new business year in public safety since we acquired New World Systems in 2015. We also experienced a significant increase in SaaS adoption of our public safety solutions with SaaS comprising 46% of our fourth quarter public safety deals. Existing on premises public safety clients are also showing heightened interest in moving to the cloud, and three public safety clients signed contracts in the fourth quarter to flip to the cloud. The City of Klamath Falls, Oregon embraced the cloud first strategy signing a contract for a SaaS deployment for integrated enterprise public safety suite, which includes the full suite of our public safety solutions, including Enterprise Records Management, Jail Manager, Fire, electronic patient care reporting, civil process, e-citations and analytics. Our recent contract signed in Q2 with the Oregon State Patrol serve as a strong reference for this competitive win. Other notable public safety deals included a SaaS contract with Santa Rosa County, Florida and on-premises contracts with Rensselaer County and Wayne County both in New York. We also had a significant cross sell win under our state enterprise agreement in Arkansas for a public safety solution for Pulaski County, Arkansas. In the court space, we signed our first SaaS flip of a statewide court system with the Idaho Supreme Court. This five year agreement includes migrating the court's 44 counties and 200 courtrooms from on premises deployments to our SaaS offering. Our largest new SaaS deal in the quarter was with the state of North Carolina where we extended the term of our existing court SaaS agreement for five years and expanded the agreement to add our solution for appellate courts. We also achieved key operational milestones in Courts & Justice during the quarter, including the successful go live of our Enterprise Justice solution with the LA County Criminal Courts. This completed the countywide rollout across 35 court locations in the nation's largest court. With our application platform, we secured a key SaaS win with the Virginia Department of Education to upgrade its enterprise state regulatory system and modernize its citizen portal. The system will support the management of Virginia's child daycare programs, which are transitioning from the Department of Social Services to the DOE. During the fourth quarter, we also signed 172 new payments deals, bringing the total to 600 for the year. We also signed a new state enterprise contract in Maryland following a competitive rebid of our expiring contract as well as an extension of our Oklahoma enterprise agreement. Finally, as noted on our last call, we completed the acquisitions of ARInspect and ResourceX in October for a combined purchase price of approximately $37 million in cash and stock. We're pleased to see multiple early wins for application platform leveraging field operations and inspection capabilities that came to us through ARInspect. Now, I'd like Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2024. Thanks, Brian. We entered 2024 with tremendous optimism and confidence in the year ahead and beyond as we execute our mid to long term strategy supporting our Tyler 2030 vision. We expect to return to a trajectory of consistent operating margin expansion in 2024 as we increasingly realize the benefits of our cloud optimization initiatives and execute our planned exits from our two proprietary data centers in 2024 and 2025. We continue to leverage our competitive strengths and demonstrate the value of our deep domain expertise across the broadest, most integrated offerings that are uniquely focused on the public sector, while empowering our clients who serve the public through Tyler's next generation cloud applications. Finally, we are proud to be recognized by Government Technology Magazine as a GovTech 100 company for 2024. This marks our 8th consecutive year being recognized for our work in making a difference for government through technology.  Now, we'd like to open the line for Q&A. Just a follow-up on that. I mean when we outlined our Tyler 2030 vision, we obviously -- we've got some goals around flips over the next six, seven years. And we also have goals on on some of our G&A initiatives. So I think those are both tracking right now in line and with our expectations going forward. I think there's still room to go and there's a lot that goes into that. We're continuing to optimize our products and find ways for them to run more efficiently. On the other side of it, we're also seeing -- continuing to make strides in our version consolidation, particularly with our major product lines. We've seen, over the last 12 months, significant version consolidation in two of our larger flagship products, and that will continue to contribute efficiencies as we go forward, as well as with some of our other products that are out there. As you know, we signed an extension that now runs through the end of 31, which runs through our Tyler 2030 initiative, which is great. It obviously just further deepen those relationships. We've made certain commitments to AWS around migrating our existing Tyler clients, our net new clients into AWS. AWS has also made commitments back to us around certain pricing commitments, innovation, marketing, things like that. I'm not really at liberty to go into the specifics of what those details and those commitments and pricing concessions are. But what I can say is that AWS has been a great partner for us. I couldn't be more happy with the relationship that we started in the fall of 2019. And this extension, I think, further embraces that. They're very collaborative with us and are eager to work with us to help us find ways to lower our costs. So they are a true partner. Similarly, we view our clients in the public sector as partners, that's why they view us. And I think part of the difference also in our relationship now is it's more mature. And we're a lot farther along in our cloud journey than we were when we first signed it. If you remember when we first signed the agreement, we were still trying to figure out how our products would really operate in AWS, and we spent a long time trying to just figure out the cost of just moving simply lift and shift. And now we've transformed and we've done all that and it's how can we make them run even more efficiently in the public cloud. So great partner, excited that they're on this journey with us for the next at least eight years. Josh, right now, I would say I'm confident in both our 2025 and our 2030 projections just from overall what I'm seeing in the business. As Brian remarked or pointed out in the opening remarks, a couple of things impact revenue growth this year, and one really is the flat to slightly declining merchant fee growth. So when you pull out merchant fees, our growth is really more in the closer to mid-9s, probably 93%, 94%, it's about 90 basis points and those tend to fluctuate. And part of that is, as Brian mentioned, due to one of our large state enterprise contracts flipping from the gross to net model. Overall, as you pointed out, I mean, what we're seeing in the markets right now, the demand, the number of new business deals we're signing, our competitive position, wins against really some key large Tier 1 competitors are the things that really give me a lot of confidence. We recently had our national sales meeting really dive deep into sales forecast, not only for the next 12, 24 months, but even beyond. And right now, things look pretty good. Yes, I think it's hard to say, Joshua. All of our global submarket's a little bit different and the courts market, for sure, it's an area where people may be a little reluctant to go first. So getting Idaho there and going, eyes are going to be on it. And I think as we successfully pull off that deal, I do think it will trigger more throughout the courts community. As you know, everything we do is reference business. But particularly in these larger state wide deals our state corp business, I think all the other states are watching Idaho. So we need to do what we do best, which is go and execute on the business and go make it a great experience. And I do think that will be a domino that will ripple throughout the client base. I think about midyear is -- because that midyear is when we expect to start to bring them up into AWS. And that uplift is included in our guidance for the year, but it's a couple of million dollar uplift from what they were paying in maintenance. Matt, I'll start and Brian, you may jump in. There are a couple of things that are really exciting about that California State Parks deal. One obviously is it's the largest transaction deal in Tyler's history. The second thing is, as you pointed out, it validates this sort of self funding model. It's not a surprise. Anybody who reads the journal that California has significant deficits and significant budgetary issues right now. And so going to them with a self funded model on this type of contract is really about the only way they can do it. And so again, it validates that model, that part of our business. Because it's self funded, the impact going forward we will be recognizing a lot more expense in 2024. It's actually a little bit of a drag on margins in 2024. But ramps up significantly in '25 and continues that ramp up with margin expansion all the way through the end of the contract in 2031, assuming we don't get the two one year extensions, which if we execute, we think we would get. Brian, do you have anything more to add? No, I think there's still more leverage. And I think generally going forward, we make certain commitments to AWS, and we're making those commitments based on projections. But we're continuing, as I mentioned earlier, to further optimize our products, further reduce our versions. I think the leverage in our cloud operations still has quite a bit of room to go. You're right. Kelly, our flips in Q4 were actually up about 12% over Q4 last year. We're not putting out guidance as far as I know, Brian, on specific foot deal count. There's a lot of things that go into that. And as you look out to 2030, the goals we outlined, clearly, we will be ramping up as over time. There's things that go into the flips and a lot of it is, we have to get our customers on more modern versions. And when I talk about our version collapse efforts that have been going on for several years but some of the strides that we've been making, as we continue to make strides on that, it will make -- it will help accelerate the pace of flips going forward. We've made a lot of progress, in particular, if you look at our enterprise ERP product, for example, I think at the end of last year, we only had about 23% of that client base on the more modern version at the end of this year, end of 202,3 that was up to 86%. We've made similar strides with our Enterprise Justice solution. So just generally, across the board, we're tracking on that. I'm not sure if I remember saying at the end of 2025, I think it was more 26%. But I think we're actually ahead of the pace that I was thinking about and discussing maybe 18 months, 24 months ago. Rob, it's actually -- it's very interesting and to your point, gratifying to see this shift. And we've been anticipating it, but we just didn't know when it was going to happen. I think we mentioned in the opening remarks, about 46% of our Q4 deals were cloud deals in public safety, that's up from 16% in Q2. And as we look out next year, we think it's going to cross 50% and we're sort of planning on a little north of 50%. We're taking an approach that now with public safety as we see the market receptiveness start to be, it's an approach that we took generally with Tyler going back four, five years, which is, going forward, we really want to be leading to the cloud. We think the market is ready. As it relates to competitors, I'm not going to list all the different competitors in public safety. Obviously, we've had a few pop up in the last couple of years that were more cloud native already. Those have been a little bit smaller competitors and they have had their own set of issues to deal with. I think that we are well positioned with our cloud strategy in public safety to take advantage of this market shift. We have new leadership at public safety. If you've been on our Web site, you might have seen a new division president that came on last year, came from outside of Tyler. He's actually has led -- been a part of leading companies through the cloud transition. So it's exciting to have him there, have him up in Troy with the people and really sort of helping lead those efforts. So I like where we are, like where we sit. And to reiterate your words, it's gratifying to see these early results. But a lot of things I'm going to caution is a lot of things to go execute on in the future, but it is good to see this shift starting to happen in public safety. Charles, not really, not right now. Q1 is probably -- we talked about the situation -- was talking about seasonality. Q1 is probably a little bit slower time in that business as well. And right now, there's no real change in our outlook. And Jon, I would just add to -- I mean, we're always looking at levers to help make us more efficient. There's a number of internal initiatives going on where we look around and look up and see opportunities for where we can operate internally more efficiently. And there's a number of those things that we're actively acting on, which is, that really sounds weird, we're progressing on. I think right now, we're still sort of in the same place we've been for the last couple of years. We're even though we will likely pay off the term debt sometime this spring, we still have that $600 million convert that's due in a little more than two years. So my anticipation would be we will be building some cash reserves to be in a position to pay that off rather than renegotiate that at a high bank rate. But at the same time, just like we've done over the last couple of years, we were going to continue to do M&A, particularly where it makes sense strategically and where it's accretive to Tyler. Last year, we did four deals. I think we spent about $75 million, $76 million in cash and stock. Over the last few years, we've spent several hundred million dollars of deals even as we were prioritizing debt paydown. So we still want to prioritize being in a good position when the convertible is due, but at the same time, we'll make smart acquisitions along the way. Well, it certainly is another conversation point with the client. So anytime you use a conversation point, there's opportunities for cross sell, upsell. But we've got installed sales teams across all of our organizations and they're reaching out to clients whether they're halfway through their SaaS contract or at the beginning of the SaaS contract or towards the end of it. So I don't know that that's a specific trigger for signify material uplift, but it's another data point that's a contact point with our clients. Yes, absolutely. You're spot on on both. And some of these issues have come with obviously some existing clients of ours and it is an opportunity. The cloud is more stable, more secure. We actually have done some deals where clients who might have been resistant to the cloud have flipped, because of some sort of recent ransomware or other issue. Yes, I think at Investor Day, we said we were somewhere around 15%. And so obviously, we've made progress since then. I'd say we're probably more around the 20% number now in terms of the -- that we've moved. But as I said earlier, we are -- each of our products has a time line and a road map for how they get to that point that converges on our entire customer base being 75% to 85% of the existing on-prem customers converted by 2030. So each product is starting from a different place with their customer base. We've talked about public safety just getting its first flips this past year. Other products are much further along. So everybody has their own road map that converge on that overall number by 2030. And none of those will happen exactly as planned but we have said that we are collectively on track to achieve those targets by 2030. Yes, let me clarify that. It's a drag on margin in 2024. It will probably equate roughly to maybe a little bit of margin drag in '25, but it's just the ramp-up of revenues versus expenses. So the expenses are more front loaded to get them up and running. As Brian mentioned, we're going from a contract that was a little under $3 million a year in revenues. I think first year, we're expecting it to just slightly more than double that. But you look out in 2025, it goes to $20 million and we expect it to grow all the way up to close to $30 million by the end of the contract. We do expect positive OP starting next year and ramping up significantly each year over time. And I think part of your question was around total contract value, TCV. So that will obviously vary a little bit depending on the SaaS term that we sign. You could use a rule of thumb of what a license deal and a one year maintenance that might drag on that versus sort of what we would project as a normal SaaS deal. So if the SaaS contract was probably only one or two years, it's probably going to have a lower TCV. If it's north of three years, we get to four years, five years, we'd have probably initial higher TCV. Thanks, Lavesh, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks. Have a great day."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. In order to address your questions and stay within the allotted time, please limit your questions to one question per person. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, also, this conference is being recorded today, November 2, 2023. I would like to turn the call over to Hala Elsherbini, Tyler's Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nHala Elsherbini: Thank you, Aaron, and welcome to our call. With me today is Lynn Moore, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. After I give the safe harbor statement, Lynn will have some initial comments on our quarter, and then Brian will review the details of our results and provide an update to our annual guidance. Lynn will end with some additional comments and then we'll take questions. During this call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Also, in our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financials tab schedules with supplemental information, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. Please note, there have been minor re-classes between historical SaaS and transaction-based revenues on the supplemental schedule as a result of the recent transition to our new financial systems. On the Events & Presentations tab, we have posted an earnings summary slide deck to supplement our prepared remarks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Hala. Our third quarter earnings and cash flow surpassed expectations and reflect a continuation of execution at a high level on key operational initiatives. We achieved strong performance across several of our key metrics with double-digit recurring growth and free cash flow growth of more than 40%. Our recurring revenue mix rose to 83.4% of our total revenues with SaaS revenues up 26% organically. This was our 11th consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more and exceeded our near-term growth expectations of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025, as outlined during our June Investor Day. We also achieved solid growth in our transaction-based revenues, which were up 8.5%. While operating margins this quarter declined slightly from last year as expected due to our cloud transition, margins were ahead of plan as a result of our operating efficiencies and expense management, especially around cloud operations. It is encouraging to see margins hold essentially flat with last year even as we made considerable progress in our cloud optimization and cloud transition efforts, establishing a clear road map for operating margin improvement in 2024. The third quarter presented a very difficult comparison for our new software contract value and mix as last year's third quarter included two very large SaaS contracts that totaled $70 million in contract value. As we discuss regularly, the timing of large deals such as the two signed in last year's third quarter can cause significant lumpiness in our new software bookings. We're continuing to see a healthy public sector market environment and our new business pipeline is active. Leading indicators RFPs and sales demos remain strong with deals generally moving through the pipeline at a normal pace, which is often a 12- to 18-month procurement process. Overall, our competitive position and win rates are strong with growing momentum in cross-selling activities, a key value creation lever. Additionally, our transaction business continues to capture higher volumes as we gain traction with our unified payments solution. I'd like to highlight some of our significant third quarter wins, which included a number of cross-sell opportunities. We continue to build momentum with our public safety solutions. Key third quarter wins include the Naperville, Illinois Police Department for integrated public safety suite including CAD, records management and e-citations. Naperville is the fourth largest city in Illinois, a state where we also have a strong presence with our Enterprise Justice solution. We're also pleased to see SaaS adoption growing and acceptance in the market with several cloud contracts signed during the quarter. We continue to gain traction with cross-sell wins under our digital solutions division, formerly NIC, and our state enterprise agreements. Under our state enterprise agreement in Utah, we won a cross-sell opportunity with the Utah Department of Corrections for our enterprise corrections electronic messaging solution. We also added deals for our application platform formerly entellitrak, under our state enterprise agreements in Louisiana and Indiana. In the federal market, we secured a significant license win with the US National Guard Bureau for our turnkey suite of workforce case management applications. This is our largest workforce case management application within the Department of Defense and is another marquee win that spans 54 US states, territories in the District of Columbia that will be hosted in our FedRAMP-certified private cloud. We signed a five-year multi-suite SaaS contract with Port Angeles, Washington, which includes our enterprise ERP, enterprise permitting licensing and cybersecurity solutions as well as payments. In the outdoor accretion space we won a competitive deal for accretion dynamic solutions with the Minnesota State Parks. In our Payments business, we signed a one-year extension for enterprise payment processing under our state enterprise agreement in New Jersey. In Harris County, Texas, the third largest county in the nation, added our digital jury solution, leveraging the disbursements capabilities that came to us through the Rapid Financial acquisition last year. Before I turn the call over to Brian, I want to highlight our recent acquisition activity. As I said at our Investor Day, M&A is part of our DNA. And during the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Computer Systems Innovations for approximately $36 million in cash. CSI brings AI-driven automation and enhanced document processing technology that can be leveraged across many of Tyler's vertical applications. It has primarily served the court technology space for many years, and we're excited about the opportunity to combine expansive footprint with CSI's expertise in AI and machine learning applications to elevate several of our other solutions. Earlier this week, we completed two other tuck-in acquisitions. ARInspect is a leading provider of AI-powered machine learning and data-driven solutions for public sector field operations. ARInspect's advanced AI solution and expertise extends our applications platform with intelligent edge technology that can be leveraged across our state and federal verticals. ResourceX adds priority-based budgeting solutions to our entire ERP portfolio to address key challenges our clients face in their traditional budgeting process. The total purchase price for these two acquisitions was approximately $38 million in cash and stock. We're thrilled to welcome each of these companies and their team members to Tyler. Now I'd like Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2023.\nBrian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Total revenues for the quarter were $494.7 million, up 4.5%. Organic revenue growth, which also excludes COVID-related revenues, was 6.0%. Last year's third quarter included $11.7 million of revenues from COVID-related initiatives at our Digital Solutions division, all of which ended in 2022. Subscriptions revenue increased 16.1% and organically rose 14.7%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew organically 26% and to $138.5 million. It is important to note that as our software contract mix continues to shift towards SaaS, our growth rate may vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the lag in time from contract signing to the start of revenue recognition, but we remain on track with our near-term growth expectations of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025. Transaction revenues grew 8.5% to $156.7 million, up 6% on an organic basis. License revenue declined 47.9% as our software business continues to shift to SaaS. SaaS deals comprised 80% of our Q3 new software contract value compared to 91% last year. As we noted earlier, last year's Q3 included two large SaaS deals totaling $70 million in contract value. Professional services revenue declined 14.9% primarily due to the absence of COVID-related revenues and was flat organically. We added 161 new SaaS arrangements and converted 79 existing on-premises clients to SaaS with a total contract value of approximately $71 million. In Q3 of last year, we added 153 new SaaS arrangements and had 70 on-premises conversions with a total contract value of approximately $149 million. Overall, our pace of on-premises conversions to SaaS continues at a steady pace with 246 slips year-to-date, and we expect Q4 conversions will be 100 or more. More importantly, the total contract value associated with flips has increased year-to-date to $58 million. As we've discussed, conversions are a significant growth driver over the next several years as we accelerate the pace of flips. Including transaction revenues, expansions with existing clients and professional services, total bookings increased 10.3% on an organic basis. Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.65 billion, up 11% and organically grew 9.8%. Operating margins were better than expected despite pressure from our ongoing cloud transition. Our non-GAAP OP margin was 24.8%, down by 10 basis points from Q3 of last year. As we discussed in prior quarters, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins. In Q3, we paid merchant fees of approximately $36 million. If those fees were netted out of both revenues and cost of revenues, our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter would have been approximately 190 basis points higher. Both cash flows from operations and free cash flow were robust this quarter at $177.5 million and $162.7 million, respectively, primarily driven by higher revenue collections. Cash flow in the quarter was impacted by approximately $22 million of incremental due to Section 174. On a pro forma basis, excluding the incremental Section 174 cash taxes of $112 million, our year-to-date free cash flow would be approximately $300 million, up 41% over last year. We continue to prioritize repayment of our term debt as a use of our cash flow. And in Q3, we reduced our term debt by $135 million. We ended Q3 with total outstanding debt of $740 million and cash and investments of approximately $153 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 1.24 times trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. Our updated 2023 guidance is as follows: We expect total revenues will be between $1.942 billion and $1.962 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 7.5%. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.82 and $3.96 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option activity on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.66 and $7.80. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $24 million, including approximately $5 million of non-cash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q3 earnings deck posted on our website. In conjunction with our guidance for the full year, I'd like to remind you of the seasonality around our transaction revenues. While transaction revenues will grow year-over-year, as expected, they declined sequentially in Q3 and will decline sequentially again in Q4. Historically, transaction revenues are driven by two primary factors; state-determined deadlines like corporate filings and hunting seasons and the number of business days. Transaction revenues are typically at the highest in Q2, coinciding with peak outdoor seasons and tax deadlines. Transactions are at a seasonal low in the fourth quarter with fewer business days and less activity around the holidays. As we noted previously, we are also seeing the revenue impact of a midyear contractual changes in one of our state enterprise agreements that include a move from a gross to net model for payments. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. We're making solid progress every quarter to deliver our near and long-term objectives that we discussed in detail at our Investor Day earlier this year. Consistent with our track record, we continue to scale our enterprise while capturing more efficiencies as we transform into a largely pure cloud business, supported by a unified One Tyler strategy. Our strong year-to-date performance, underpinned by our powerful financial algorithm, strong balance sheet and our unique ability to deliver mission-critical software solutions, enabling the public sector's ongoing digital transformation. We're also proud that 11 of our state partners won E-Republic Government Experience Awards. Our clients in Utah, Mississippi, Indiana, Arkansas and Virginia swept the top 5 spots in the GovEx awards. Our momentum continues to build as we complete this pivotal year in our cloud transition. Our team is excited about the tremendous opportunity ahead of us, and we look forward to sharing our continued progress as we finish out 2023. Now we'd like to open the line for Q&A\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from the line of Matthew VanVliet with BTIG. Your line is live.\nMatthew VanVliet: Yeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, when you look at the ongoing portfolio of company -- or of customers that are looking to make cloud migrations and the overall flips there and then some of the net new business, I know you've highlighted public safety in the past as probably being a laggard longer term. But it seems like momentum of cloud deals there is starting to pick up. Do you anticipate that encouraging more of your existing customers to make those flips? How are those conversations going? And ultimately, how much upside do you feel like there's still left on the public safety side as you get more momentum in the cloud there?\nLynn Moore: Yeah, Matt, that's a good question. And you're right. Historically, public safety has been a little bit slower to adopt. We're seeing that change -- I hesitate to say rapidly, but we are starting to see the momentum shift and the pendulum change a little bit. We're seeing it in the deals that we're doing. We're seeing it in the acceptance of our clients. I'd say more so still on the RMS, the record side. Mobility is already there, but you're seeing a little bit of on the CAD side. Just this past quarter, actually, we did a deal with Manassas, Virginia, where they were on-camp -- on-prem CAD RMS client and we flipped them over to SaaS. So I think just like the rest of the businesses, that as the market continues to gain acceptance the momentum will continue to grow. And we're pretty optimistic and look out into 2024 that the number of flips and the number of SaaS deals will continue to grow at a faster pace, albeit still not a majority of the business yet.\nMatthew VanVliet: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks for your question. Our next question is from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Your line is live.\nKirk Materne: Yeah. Thanks very much. Congrats on the quarter, guys. Lynn, can you just give a little bit more color on what you're seeing sort of across some of the product categories in terms of SaaS bookings, meaning activity levels maybe on ERP versus Courts & Justice versus public safety? Just kind of a little bit more color on that might be helpful. Just trying to get a sense of where you're seeing momentum. And any color, I guess, on public safety into the fourth quarter too would also be helpful. Thanks.\nLynn Moore: Yeah. I think, generally speaking, across our entire portfolio, we're either -- with the exception of public safety and probably our platform solutions, but all our other ones are -- we're pretty much leading first with SaaS. Deals -- our budgets around SaaS are high. And ERP I think we're north of 90%. Courts & Justice is high. The two market areas that are a little bit slower still are public safety platform solutions, which is our federal space. But even there, the modernization efforts that are going on at the federal government is really starting to shift that pendulum to SaaS as well. So for the overall majority of our business, we're -- the demand is there and the market receptiveness is there. And it's starting -- the momentum for those other two pieces are starting to go forward. When you look at our licenses, licenses now are about 2% of our total revenues. Most of that -- a lot of those license deals are coming out of those two other divisions even as there still are some licenses, pockets of licenses around the rest of the business.\nKirk Materne: Thanks. I\u2019ll hop back in the queue.\nOperator: Thanks for your question. Our next question is from the line of Joshua Reilly with Needham. Your line is live.\nJoshua Reilly: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Nice job on the quarter here. Our checks indicated that the MicroPact business had a pretty strong pipeline coming into Q3 here, which makes sense with the fiscal year-end for the federal government. Can you just give some more color on how these deals closed and how -- anything to note on the cross-sell into the NIC state contracts that might be adjacent with the MicroPact business? And is there any more of these deals that potentially fell into the fourth quarter? Thank you.\nLynn Moore: Yeah, I'll start. I didn't quite hear all that, Brian. So I'll let you jump in. But yes, so our platform solutions, Q3 is normally their strongest quarter. They had that really strong deal with the National Guard Bureau. There was a fairly significant license deal that slipped and probably got pushed to 2024, and it was really around some uncertainty with the federal government funding as Q3 was coming to a close and the move of some funds to what the Feds consider to be more mission critical. The number of deals that we're doing and the pipeline of deals that we're doing at Federal continues to grow, but there still are some very large deals that can swing quarter-to-quarter. A lot of times, once that sort of window passes in Q3, there's still a volume of deals that happen in Q4, Q1, Q2,-- but the sense of urgency is probably not quite the same as it is as you get into late Q2 and into Q3.\nBrian Miller: Yes. And on the cross-sell, the opportunities with our application platform, the formerly called MicroPact entellitrak product, remains one of the strongest opportunities and one of the areas where we're seeing the most activity in terms of leveraging the digital solutions state contracts to sell that into those states. And we had a couple of deals this quarter that we mentioned in the prepared remarks in different applications. I think in Louisiana and Indiana, where we've seen progress. And we've seen a number of those deals since the acquisition of NIC and that continues to be an opportunity that we're pursuing actively.\nLynn Moore: Yeah. I mean, the synergy between what we do at federal and the state market is really strong. As Brian mentioned, we're seeing more pipeline there. And really because when you think about the state government and what they're doing, a lot of what they're doing is case management. And our application platform really sort of serves those modernization needs. Less expensive, it's nimbler, it's built for government. It's enhanced by our mobility, our D&I, our payments. So we do see that synergy, and I think it's something that's going to become more of a focus for us as we look into 2024 and 2025.\nJoshua Reilly: Thanks guys. Nice job on the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Rob Oliver with Baird.\nRob Oliver: Great. Hi, thanks. Good morning. In the prepared remarks, you called out the Naperville, Illinois win in public safety. And it sounds like that was a cross-sell on Courts & Justice. So just curious if that's a path you guys are -- you called out because you're seeing success there. Obviously, the Tyler One vision, those being tied together would make a lot of sense. But is that a go-to-market play that you see driving increased wins for public safety in the future here? Thank you.\nLynn Moore: I do. I think we talk about it with our Connected Communities vision and sort of the leverage and power we can create between our public safety and our enterprise justice visions. It was a really good win. It was a good win because it was a very competitive deal. As you'd imagine, it was a license deal of over $1 million. So those are always going to be competitive. And I think part to your point as well, we actually did a smaller deal in California this past quarter. That was with Ameriposta County Sheriff's Office out in California, and that was really leveraging the enterprise justice contract to bring Tyler corrections there. Important deal because we hadn't really had a win in California in a little bit of time and leveraging our relationship with -- on the Courts & Justice side and leveraging that contract was something that got us in the door, and I think an opportunity to expand not only in that department, but also in California.\nRob Oliver: Great. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it. \nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Terry Tillman with Truist Securities. Your line is live.\nConnor Passarella: Great. Good morning. This is Connor Passarella on for Terry. Appreciate you taking the question. Just curious on the payments business and how we should be thinking about organic growth going forward in that segment. And then also just on the payment disbursement use cases that have progressed since the acquisition of Rapid Financial last year. Thank you.\nLynn Moore: I'll start with the use cases. Right now, Rapid, when we bought them, they were primarily in the court space, and that's our primary focus right now. We're in the process. We're early in our 2024 budgeting, thinking about the investments and the various other disbursement cases that we want to put our money towards. So I'm not going to give you our R&D time line right now or our priorities, but we're in the process of doing that. We -- as we've talked before, I think the opportunities across the Tyler solutions is pretty expansive on the disbursement side. We've talked before, I think, as big as on the acquiring side. But currently, right now, the focus is primarily still in the courts area.\nA \u2013Brian Miller : Yes. And on the expectations for growth rates around payments, at Investor Day, we broadly talked about an expectation of transaction revenues growing in the 10% to 13% range and expanding margins there over the next several years. As we've said, we're in the very early innings of executing on the cross-sell opportunity of driving payments more deeply into our local government customer base. And so we're still ramping that up, seeing good success in expanding those numbers of new deals each quarter. But generally, that 10% to 13% CAGR for transaction revenues is our expectation over the next few years.\nConnor Passarella: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is live.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe just two quick ones for me. Bookings look like it took a step up this quarter after the last -- particularly over the last couple of quarters. So I wanted to just understand the outperformance there. Is that accomplished year or incremental momentum? And then same question. Obviously, cash flow looked like it meaningfully outperformed, at least our estimates and I think consensus. So just an understanding of was there anything onetime there? And how should we think about it for Q4? And then just any color, Brian, on the specific elements around some of the cloud -- or SaaS statement? This quarter, what drove that? And how should we think about that going forward?\nA \u2013Brian Miller : Yes. So a couple of things there. Cash flow, most of the outperformance was -- you see it in the working capital side and just really strong collections around our revenues driving good performance around our receivables. I think we're continuing to see the impact of more and more recurring revenues and the positive cash flow characteristics around that. Not really any onetime things there. But I think that our expectation for the year has ratcheted up a little bit. I think right now, even after the impact of the Section 174 cash taxes, which the biggest impact was in the first half of the year, I think we said there's a $22 million impact on cash taxes this quarter, back around the $15 million incremental taxes in Q4. But I think our expectation for the full year now is more in the $220 million to $240 million range for free cash flow, which is up from where we thought last quarter. We did make some minor reclasses in the historical data, the split between -- in subscription, so all in the subscription category on the face of our income statement. But in the breakout of those, between transaction revenues and SaaS revenues. As we transition to a new financial system this quarter, we had better clarity on some of the mapping of the revenues, primarily from acquisitions since NIC and reclassified those somewhat between transactions and SaaS. So we've just sort of cleaned up some of those historical numbers. Don't expect any more changes going forward.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. And what about on the bookings side?\nA \u2013Brian Miller : Yes, the booking side, we talked about this, it can be kind of lumpy. But generally, the -- really a reflection of kind of the combination of all the new SaaS business, the new increases in the transaction business, which kind of run through bookings at the same time as they run through revenues. And just the combination of all that led to a stronger quarter this quarter. We didn't have any of the mega deals, but we did have a really solid flow of new SaaS deals, some -- a couple of not super large but meaningful license deals this quarter and then pretty good activity around the expansions with existing customers as well. So it's pretty broad-based, but again not driven by super large contracts, but nice growth across all of our revenue streams.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is live.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey, Lynn. Hey, Brian, thanks for taking my question here. Brian maybe for you. I'd love to dig into the restatements just one level deeper. So can you just walk through what some of the -- one of -- I guess, what some of the items were from the NIC business that are now SaaS versus transaction? And maybe the follow-on is how would your SaaS revenue growth have looked I guess, excluding the restatement? I know that I think it's about 26% year-over-year growth this quarter. What would that have been under the old convention, which is what our model is kind of currently are based on? Does that make sense?\nBrian Miller: Yes. I don't have that number in front of me. They're not restatements. In the financial statements, they were always all in subscription revenues. It's in the...\nSaket Kalia: That\u2019s fair, it\u2019s a reclass. That's fair. It's a reclass not a restatement, Brian.\nBrian Miller: Some of those were -- when we originally acquired NIC and before we basically had almost all their revenues classified in our transaction category. And some of the revenues from a contract can have sort of a blend of some SaaS revenues and transaction revenues around those. So they're providing some software services but getting paid with transaction fees. And so sometimes there's some boring between that. Also, when we acquired the VendEngine acquisition, we initially made an additional judgment from their financials of how those revenues should be spread. And with a deeper understanding of those, we start to map those to our new financial system. We just found that some of those were more appropriately classified a different way. So those are all relatively minor reclassifications as well. So I don't think there's a big change in the trend, but...\nSaket Kalia: But maybe just to maybe understand that a little bit better because 26% growth is quite a bit higher than what we were seeing before. I mean, was that mix -- that the newly added SaaS revenue there, was that growing significantly faster than sort of what I'll call the old SaaS revenue that was in there? Because it is quite a bit higher than what it was before. So I just -- I wanted to make sure I just kind of flesh that out.\nBrian Miller: No, no. There's not a significant change from that. That's not really accelerating it. The 26% growth is actually an acceleration this quarter. But again, we said that will maybe move around from quarter-to-quarter. But generally, we expect this around the 20% CAGR over the next couple of years in SaaS revenue. Some quarters, it may be higher. And as we talked about, some of that variability from quarter-to-quarter has to do with the lag from when we sign a new SaaS deal to when those revenues hit, which can be a quarter or two occasionally longer.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is live.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to better understand sort of the AI opportunity that you're seeing out there and sort of the rationale for making the acquisitions at this time. Just given state and local governments typically adopt technologies a little bit more slowly, how do you think about sort of driving these types of solutions? What does the opportunity look like? Just want to get the broader color. Thank you.\nLynn Moore: Yes, sure, Jonathan. Obviously, it's a pretty rapidly evolving landscape. There's a lot that's in the news, some of it may be a little more hype. But it's real. And we see AI benefits within Tyler, we're kind of looking at it in two different ways. We're looking at it sort of pointing it internally, things that we're doing, how can we make ourselves more efficient by using AI. Because I think one of the biggest benefits around AI really is when you're talking about sort of high-volume repetitive tasks, which there are pieces of our business that do that, whether it's some software coding, it may be some things around some support, things like that. The other side of it is how do we make our products more competitive and differentiate them more? What we've done internally is we've organized a working group that's been in place for several quarters, looking at all the various opportunities. There's pockets of AI going on all around Tyler right now. We want to take -- not surprisingly, what we always do at Tyler is sort of a deliberate targeted approach. Sort of we're in the process of identifying what are the couple of key areas that we want to focus on in both of those scenarios, whether we're pointing it internally around creating more efficiencies or adding more competitiveness to our products. The CSI acquisition is a great example of that. They really started off as a sort of a document redaction sort of extraction leader. Recently, they've added some machine learning and robotic process automation. This is something that all of our core clients need and some of our core clients were already using. Tarrant County, which is here out in Fort Worth, they've utilized the CSI acquisition and what it saved in their personnel costs, this is their numbers not mine. they're saying they've cut their labor costs by 50% by sort of automating some of these more repetitive things around documents which, of course, there's a lot there. So even the CSI acquisition, we were just talking earlier the Rapid acquisition. Initially, it's in the court space, that's where we're pointing it. But we also see a lot of places and leverage it across other platforms in Tyler, whether it's things in our ERP space like invoice processing and things like that. So a lot of applicability. You're right, states and clients are -- they're taking different approaches, and we're going to take that deliberate approach with our clients.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Clarke Jeffries with Piper Sandler. Your line is live.\nClarke Jeffries: Good morning Thank you for taking the question. I apologize, I'm maybe going to beat a dead horse and ask a little bit more questions about the reclass. But specifically, looking at SaaS ARR either pre-reclass or post reclass, been in this mid-single-digit sequential growth paradigm. And what stood out was an acceleration of maybe a high single-digit sequential growth in ARR. And so, Brian, I wanted to ask, is this a reflection of maybe the good bookings you had last year and some of those deals finally reaching the timing where they would be going live in revenue terms? Or was there a change being made in the business, either on a capacity level or a new bookings level that we may not appreciate that contributed to an acceleration in ARR growth? Thank you.\nBrian Miller: Yes. Clarke, I think it's more the latter. So it's more of that timing. So good bookings, it could be as much as a year ago or longer, that -- where we signed new SaaS deals that some of those are now more fully reflected in the revenue run rate as well as flips. So obviously, the pace of flips has been accelerating over the last couple of years, continues to accelerate. But again, from the time -- the numbers we announced each quarter, the contract signed for flips this quarter, so that revenue uplift shifting from maintenance to SaaS, typically, call it, a 1.7x multiple, there's a lag from that. So the flips we signed last year or last quarter or the quarter before, some of those are now seeing the revenue uplift. So there's just sort of a lag from -- which is different than some SaaS companies, that lag from the time of contract signed to the time that those revenues start to hit our income statement. So I think that's more of that acceleration. And as we continue to increase the pace of flips and grow -- move more of the new business to SaaS, you'll continue to see that accelerate, although with a lag.\nClarke Jeffries: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question is from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is live.\nKelly Valenti: Hi. This is Kelly Valenti on for Gabriela. One for Mobi [ph]. Last quarter, you made very specific comments on RFP and demo activity at or above pre-COVID highs, while it sounds like top of funnel remains strong. What are you seeing in the back half of this year compared to that dynamic that you were seeing in the first half? And then are there any idiosyncracies of the government end market making you more or less bullish on RFP and demo activity next year?\nLynn Moore: Yeah. Thanks, Kelly. I would say it's been a strong year. And I would say we characterize that in the first half of the year is very strong. And I would say it's -- right now, it's steady at that pace. Overall, the markets just seem healthy. The budgets are still strong. The activity is strong and our win rates are good. So I don't see any real meaningful change across our business lines from comments we've made in the first couple of quarters.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of David Unger with Wells Fargo. Your line is live.\nDavid Unger: Great. Thank you guys. So it's great to see the net leverage coming down to 1.25 times EBITDA. Can you just remind us how you guys like to think about that leverage band and maybe some color around private market valuations? Thank you.\nLynn Moore: Yeah. Thanks, David. Sure. As you know, we've been prioritizing debt paydown a lot at the same time while we're still looking at other deals. I'm excited to -- once we dropped under 1.5 net leverage, our rate in our bank changed, and we were able to achieve that at the end of Q3. So that's encouraging. We've paid over about $1 billion of debt down. Brian talked earlier about the impact of Section 174 taxes and the pro forma free cash flow. We'd actually be out of term debt or pretty close to out of term debt right now, absent that, which is encouraging. As it relates to private market valuations there, I would say there's -- we're starting to see in the market and the deals and the things that we're hearing that expectations are finally starting to change. It's always been a little bit amazing to me that when you see things going on in the public markets and yet the private sector deals or people still think that the market should be where it was a couple of years ago. We're still pretty disciplined in how we look at acquisitions. So in areas when private expectations still are too high, we'll simply pass on the deal. We're pretty excited to get these 3 deals done, 1 in Q3 and the ones that we announced earlier this week. These are good deals. These are good business deals, things that are going to help drive our growth, things that will leverage the growth drivers that we outlined in Tyler 2030. And they're going to be accretive to revenues and margins over in pretty short order. So it's interesting, too. There's a lot of companies went private equity in the last few years. And I think we're going to start seeing a time when we're going to start spinning back out. And historically, I think they paid pretty high premiums. It's going to be interesting to see what happens in the markets, but our disciplined approach to how we do things isn't going to change.\nBrian Miller: And just to add to Lynn's comment about leverage and our comfort level, we've never been highly leveraged and don't see a scenario where we really would be given the predictability and the strength of our cash flow, especially around our recurring revenues. When we did the NIC acquisition, we were, I think, around or maybe above 3x leverage and certainly very comfortable there. Our lenders are very comfortable there. And as we said, we're focused on deleveraging, especially as interest rates rose and have done that very rapidly. But I think we have a lot of capacity as well. But within that band up to the kind of 3, 3.5 times, where we're very comfortable.\nDavid Unger: Appreciate that. Thank you gentlemen.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Pete Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Your line is live.\nPete Heckmann: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to see if you had any preliminary thoughts on the potential for the Federal Reserve to cut debit interchange and whether based on the convenience fee model that NIC had, whether a lower interchange might be a benefit to margins?\nLynn Moore: I think the short answer is no, I don't have any preliminary thoughts on it. Obviously, we watch all these types of things that are going on in the markets, particularly as we think about our long-term plans and views. I'm certainly not in a position to think one way or the other of where -- what anybody in Washington is going to do a little on the Fed. But -- so I'd say right now, I don't have any real comment on that.\nPete Heckmann: Okay. And then just a housekeeping item, Brian. Were there any single deals above, let's say, $10 million in TCV in the quarter?\nBrian Miller: I don't think we had anything above $10 million in contract value. Our biggest SaaS deal was around $5.5 million in contract value. That was the Minnesota Parks deal. And our biggest license deal was under $5 million total contract value, though it has a lot of options that could drive that significantly higher. But the booked amount was less than $5 million. So no, no -- nothing in that really large size this quarter. A lot of good midsized volume of kind of bread-and-butter deals.\nPete Heckmann: Yeah, yeah. Just a lot of singles and doubles okay, I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your call and your question. Our next question is from the line of Alexei Gogolev with JPMorgan. Your line is live.\nHelen Smith: This is Helen Smith on for Alexei Gogolev from JPMorgan. Thank you for taking my question. So my first question revolves around your private data centers. At your Investor Day, you talked at length that one data center will be closed in 2024 and the other in 2025. Do you have any updates on that front?\nLynn Moore: Yeah, I'd say right now we're on track for what we outlined. We expect our Dallas Center to shut down sort of middle of 2024. And yes, we're still on track for evacuating the other one by the end of 2025.\nHelen Smith: Great. Thank you so much. And my second question revolves around security. There have been some pretty high-level security breaches recently out like Clorox and GM, Caesars. I was wondering if this has changed the way that you're working with your customers or if your customers have brought forward any sort of concerns.\nLynn Moore: Well, yes, I mean, security is always an issue and particularly in our business and our clients. I think the thing about what's been going on with cybersecurity is it really highlights the need for our clients to move away from their traditional on-prem type environments, move to the cloud, move to the modernization and digitization efforts. And I think it contributes to that. We've seen clients where -- I talked about it, I think, a couple of quarters ago, we had a client that we were trying to move to a SaaS flip for -- out in Arizona for quite a long time. And unfortunately, they had a ransomware attack, and it was surely after that that we were able to flip them to the cloud. It was a triggering point for their decision. So it's a reality that we all have to live with, and our clients are acutely aware of it because a lot of the public sector clients are targets. But I do think it does help with the sales and understanding about where we need to go in the future together with our clients.\nHelen Smith: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you for your quarter. Our next question is from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is live.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the follow-up question here. Brian, one follow-up question for you, if I may. Can we just talk a little bit about the blended duration on SaaS bookings this quarter a little bit, putting aside the re-class. I think if we look at SaaS bookings ARR, that expectedly faced the tough comp that we were talking about earlier. So that was down year-over-year pretty decently. But SaaS TCV was actually pretty decent in terms of total bookings. I just wondered if duration was anything to consider there and how you thought about that?\nBrian Miller: Not really. Actually, the average term of our new SaaS contracts this quarter was exactly the same as third quarter of last year at 3.8 years. We've said we generally tried to bring that down over recent years and generally lead with a three-year initial term. We certainly have some clients who want a longer term. And so that blended term or that average duration has generally been in that kind of 3.5% to 4% over the last couple of years. But this quarter, yes, that wasn't a factor at all.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for your follow-up. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back over to Lynn Moore, President and CEO, for closing comments.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Aaron, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to Brian Miller or myself. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's Tyler Technologies Third Quarter 2023 Conference Call. Have a great rest of your day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Lynn. Total revenues for the quarter were $494.7 million, up 4.5%. Organic revenue growth, which also excludes COVID-related revenues, was 6.0%. Last year's third quarter included $11.7 million of revenues from COVID-related initiatives at our Digital Solutions division, all of which ended in 2022. Subscriptions revenue increased 16.1% and organically rose 14.7%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew organically 26% and to $138.5 million. It is important to note that as our software contract mix continues to shift towards SaaS, our growth rate may vary from quarter-to-quarter due to the lag in time from contract signing to the start of revenue recognition, but we remain on track with our near-term growth expectations of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025. Transaction revenues grew 8.5% to $156.7 million, up 6% on an organic basis. License revenue declined 47.9% as our software business continues to shift to SaaS. SaaS deals comprised 80% of our Q3 new software contract value compared to 91% last year. As we noted earlier, last year's Q3 included two large SaaS deals totaling $70 million in contract value. Professional services revenue declined 14.9% primarily due to the absence of COVID-related revenues and was flat organically. We added 161 new SaaS arrangements and converted 79 existing on-premises clients to SaaS with a total contract value of approximately $71 million. In Q3 of last year, we added 153 new SaaS arrangements and had 70 on-premises conversions with a total contract value of approximately $149 million. Overall, our pace of on-premises conversions to SaaS continues at a steady pace with 246 slips year-to-date, and we expect Q4 conversions will be 100 or more. More importantly, the total contract value associated with flips has increased year-to-date to $58 million. As we've discussed, conversions are a significant growth driver over the next several years as we accelerate the pace of flips. Including transaction revenues, expansions with existing clients and professional services, total bookings increased 10.3% on an organic basis. Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.65 billion, up 11% and organically grew 9.8%. Operating margins were better than expected despite pressure from our ongoing cloud transition. Our non-GAAP OP margin was 24.8%, down by 10 basis points from Q3 of last year. As we discussed in prior quarters, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins. In Q3, we paid merchant fees of approximately $36 million. If those fees were netted out of both revenues and cost of revenues, our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter would have been approximately 190 basis points higher. Both cash flows from operations and free cash flow were robust this quarter at $177.5 million and $162.7 million, respectively, primarily driven by higher revenue collections. Cash flow in the quarter was impacted by approximately $22 million of incremental due to Section 174. On a pro forma basis, excluding the incremental Section 174 cash taxes of $112 million, our year-to-date free cash flow would be approximately $300 million, up 41% over last year. We continue to prioritize repayment of our term debt as a use of our cash flow. And in Q3, we reduced our term debt by $135 million. We ended Q3 with total outstanding debt of $740 million and cash and investments of approximately $153 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 1.24 times trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. Our updated 2023 guidance is as follows: We expect total revenues will be between $1.942 billion and $1.962 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 7.5%. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.82 and $3.96 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option activity on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.66 and $7.80. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $24 million, including approximately $5 million of non-cash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q3 earnings deck posted on our website. In conjunction with our guidance for the full year, I'd like to remind you of the seasonality around our transaction revenues. While transaction revenues will grow year-over-year, as expected, they declined sequentially in Q3 and will decline sequentially again in Q4. Historically, transaction revenues are driven by two primary factors; state-determined deadlines like corporate filings and hunting seasons and the number of business days. Transaction revenues are typically at the highest in Q2, coinciding with peak outdoor seasons and tax deadlines. Transactions are at a seasonal low in the fourth quarter with fewer business days and less activity around the holidays. As we noted previously, we are also seeing the revenue impact of a midyear contractual changes in one of our state enterprise agreements that include a move from a gross to net model for payments. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn. Yes. And on the cross-sell, the opportunities with our application platform, the formerly called MicroPact entellitrak product, remains one of the strongest opportunities and one of the areas where we're seeing the most activity in terms of leveraging the digital solutions state contracts to sell that into those states. And we had a couple of deals this quarter that we mentioned in the prepared remarks in different applications. I think in Louisiana and Indiana, where we've seen progress. And we've seen a number of those deals since the acquisition of NIC and that continues to be an opportunity that we're pursuing actively. Yes. I don't have that number in front of me. They're not restatements. In the financial statements, they were always all in subscription revenues. It's in the... Some of those were -- when we originally acquired NIC and before we basically had almost all their revenues classified in our transaction category. And some of the revenues from a contract can have sort of a blend of some SaaS revenues and transaction revenues around those. So they're providing some software services but getting paid with transaction fees. And so sometimes there's some boring between that. Also, when we acquired the VendEngine acquisition, we initially made an additional judgment from their financials of how those revenues should be spread. And with a deeper understanding of those, we start to map those to our new financial system. We just found that some of those were more appropriately classified a different way. So those are all relatively minor reclassifications as well. So I don't think there's a big change in the trend, but... No, no. There's not a significant change from that. That's not really accelerating it. The 26% growth is actually an acceleration this quarter. But again, we said that will maybe move around from quarter-to-quarter. But generally, we expect this around the 20% CAGR over the next couple of years in SaaS revenue. Some quarters, it may be higher. And as we talked about, some of that variability from quarter-to-quarter has to do with the lag from when we sign a new SaaS deal to when those revenues hit, which can be a quarter or two occasionally longer. Yes. Clarke, I think it's more the latter. So it's more of that timing. So good bookings, it could be as much as a year ago or longer, that -- where we signed new SaaS deals that some of those are now more fully reflected in the revenue run rate as well as flips. So obviously, the pace of flips has been accelerating over the last couple of years, continues to accelerate. But again, from the time -- the numbers we announced each quarter, the contract signed for flips this quarter, so that revenue uplift shifting from maintenance to SaaS, typically, call it, a 1.7x multiple, there's a lag from that.

So I think that's more of that acceleration.

And as we said, we're focused on deleveraging, especially as interest rates rose and have done that very rapidly. But I think we have a lot of capacity as well. But within that band up to the kind of 3, 3.5 times, where we're very comfortable. I don't think we had anything above $10 million in contract value. Our biggest SaaS deal was around $5.5 million in contract value. That was the Minnesota Parks deal. And our biggest license deal was under $5 million total contract value, though it has a lot of options that could drive that significantly higher. But the booked amount was less than $5 million.

            "content": "Thanks, Hala. Our third quarter earnings and cash flow surpassed expectations and reflect a continuation of execution at a high level on key operational initiatives. We achieved strong performance across several of our key metrics with double-digit recurring growth and free cash flow growth of more than 40%. Our recurring revenue mix rose to 83.4% of our total revenues with SaaS revenues up 26% organically. This was our 11th consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more and exceeded our near-term growth expectations of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025, as outlined during our June Investor Day. We also achieved solid growth in our transaction-based revenues, which were up 8.5%. While operating margins this quarter declined slightly from last year as expected due to our cloud transition, margins were ahead of plan as a result of our operating efficiencies and expense management, especially around cloud operations. It is encouraging to see margins hold essentially flat with last year even as we made considerable progress in our cloud optimization and cloud transition efforts, establishing a clear road map for operating margin improvement in 2024. The third quarter presented a very difficult comparison for our new software contract value and mix as last year's third quarter included two very large SaaS contracts that totaled $70 million in contract value. As we discuss regularly, the timing of large deals such as the two signed in last year's third quarter can cause significant lumpiness in our new software bookings. We're continuing to see a healthy public sector market environment and our new business pipeline is active. Leading indicators RFPs and sales demos remain strong with deals generally moving through the pipeline at a normal pace, which is often a 12- to 18-month procurement process. Overall, our competitive position and win rates are strong with growing momentum in cross-selling activities, a key value creation lever. Additionally, our transaction business continues to capture higher volumes as we gain traction with our unified payments solution. I'd like to highlight some of our significant third quarter wins, which included a number of cross-sell opportunities. We continue to build momentum with our public safety solutions. Key third quarter wins include the Naperville, Illinois Police Department for integrated public safety suite including CAD, records management and e-citations. Naperville is the fourth largest city in Illinois, a state where we also have a strong presence with our Enterprise Justice solution. We're also pleased to see SaaS adoption growing and acceptance in the market with several cloud contracts signed during the quarter. We continue to gain traction with cross-sell wins under our digital solutions division, formerly NIC, and our state enterprise agreements. Under our state enterprise agreement in Utah, we won a cross-sell opportunity with the Utah Department of Corrections for our enterprise corrections electronic messaging solution. We also added deals for our application platform formerly entellitrak, under our state enterprise agreements in Louisiana and Indiana. In the federal market, we secured a significant license win with the US National Guard Bureau for our turnkey suite of workforce case management applications. This is our largest workforce case management application within the Department of Defense and is another marquee win that spans 54 US states, territories in the District of Columbia that will be hosted in our FedRAMP-certified private cloud. We signed a five-year multi-suite SaaS contract with Port Angeles, Washington, which includes our enterprise ERP, enterprise permitting licensing and cybersecurity solutions as well as payments. In the outdoor accretion space we won a competitive deal for accretion dynamic solutions with the Minnesota State Parks. In our Payments business, we signed a one-year extension for enterprise payment processing under our state enterprise agreement in New Jersey. In Harris County, Texas, the third largest county in the nation, added our digital jury solution, leveraging the disbursements capabilities that came to us through the Rapid Financial acquisition last year. Before I turn the call over to Brian, I want to highlight our recent acquisition activity. As I said at our Investor Day, M&A is part of our DNA. And during the third quarter, we completed the acquisition of Computer Systems Innovations for approximately $36 million in cash. CSI brings AI-driven automation and enhanced document processing technology that can be leveraged across many of Tyler's vertical applications. It has primarily served the court technology space for many years, and we're excited about the opportunity to combine expansive footprint with CSI's expertise in AI and machine learning applications to elevate several of our other solutions. Earlier this week, we completed two other tuck-in acquisitions. ARInspect is a leading provider of AI-powered machine learning and data-driven solutions for public sector field operations. ARInspect's advanced AI solution and expertise extends our applications platform with intelligent edge technology that can be leveraged across our state and federal verticals. ResourceX adds priority-based budgeting solutions to our entire ERP portfolio to address key challenges our clients face in their traditional budgeting process. The total purchase price for these two acquisitions was approximately $38 million in cash and stock. We're thrilled to welcome each of these companies and their team members to Tyler. Now I'd like Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2023. Thanks, Brian. We're making solid progress every quarter to deliver our near and long-term objectives that we discussed in detail at our Investor Day earlier this year. Consistent with our track record, we continue to scale our enterprise while capturing more efficiencies as we transform into a largely pure cloud business, supported by a unified One Tyler strategy. Our strong year-to-date performance, underpinned by our powerful financial algorithm, strong balance sheet and our unique ability to deliver mission-critical software solutions, enabling the public sector's ongoing digital transformation. We're also proud that 11 of our state partners won E-Republic Government Experience Awards. Our clients in Utah, Mississippi, Indiana, Arkansas and Virginia swept the top 5 spots in the GovEx awards. Our momentum continues to build as we complete this pivotal year in our cloud transition. Our team is excited about the tremendous opportunity ahead of us, and we look forward to sharing our continued progress as we finish out 2023. Now we'd like to open the line for Q&A Yeah, Matt, that's a good question. And you're right. Historically, public safety has been a little bit slower to adopt. We're seeing that change -- I hesitate to say rapidly, but we are starting to see the momentum shift and the pendulum change a little bit. We're seeing it in the deals that we're doing. We're seeing it in the acceptance of our clients. I'd say more so still on the RMS, the record side. Mobility is already there, but you're seeing a little bit of on the CAD side. Just this past quarter, actually, we did a deal with Manassas, Virginia, where they were on-camp -- on-prem CAD RMS client and we flipped them over to SaaS. So I think just like the rest of the businesses, that as the market continues to gain acceptance the momentum will continue to grow. And we're pretty optimistic and look out into 2024 that the number of flips and the number of SaaS deals will continue to grow at a faster pace, albeit still not a majority of the business yet. Yeah. I think, generally speaking, across our entire portfolio, we're either -- with the exception of public safety and probably our platform solutions, but all our other ones are -- we're pretty much leading first with SaaS. Deals -- our budgets around SaaS are high. And ERP I think we're north of 90%. Courts & Justice is high. The two market areas that are a little bit slower still are public safety platform solutions, which is our federal space. But even there, the modernization efforts that are going on at the federal government is really starting to shift that pendulum to SaaS as well. So for the overall majority of our business, we're -- the demand is there and the market receptiveness is there. And it's starting -- the momentum for those other two pieces are starting to go forward. When you look at our licenses, licenses now are about 2% of our total revenues. Most of that -- a lot of those license deals are coming out of those two other divisions even as there still are some licenses, pockets of licenses around the rest of the business. Yeah, I'll start. I didn't quite hear all that, Brian. So I'll let you jump in. But yes, so our platform solutions, Q3 is normally their strongest quarter. They had that really strong deal with the National Guard Bureau. There was a fairly significant license deal that slipped and probably got pushed to 2024, and it was really around some uncertainty with the federal government funding as Q3 was coming to a close and the move of some funds to what the Feds consider to be more mission critical. The number of deals that we're doing and the pipeline of deals that we're doing at Federal continues to grow, but there still are some very large deals that can swing quarter-to-quarter. A lot of times, once that sort of window passes in Q3, there's still a volume of deals that happen in Q4, Q1, Q2,-- but the sense of urgency is probably not quite the same as it is as you get into late Q2 and into Q3. Yeah. I mean, the synergy between what we do at federal and the state market is really strong. As Brian mentioned, we're seeing more pipeline there. And really because when you think about the state government and what they're doing, a lot of what they're doing is case management. And our application platform really sort of serves those modernization needs. Less expensive, it's nimbler, it's built for government. It's enhanced by our mobility, our D&I, our payments. So we do see that synergy, and I think it's something that's going to become more of a focus for us as we look into 2024 and 2025. I do. I think we talk about it with our Connected Communities vision and sort of the leverage and power we can create between our public safety and our enterprise justice visions. It was a really good win. It was a good win because it was a very competitive deal. As you'd imagine, it was a license deal of over $1 million. So those are always going to be competitive. And I think part to your point as well, we actually did a smaller deal in California this past quarter. That was with Ameriposta County Sheriff's Office out in California, and that was really leveraging the enterprise justice contract to bring Tyler corrections there. Important deal because we hadn't really had a win in California in a little bit of time and leveraging our relationship with -- on the Courts & Justice side and leveraging that contract was something that got us in the door, and I think an opportunity to expand not only in that department, but also in California. I'll start with the use cases. Right now, Rapid, when we bought them, they were primarily in the court space, and that's our primary focus right now. We're in the process. We're early in our 2024 budgeting, thinking about the investments and the various other disbursement cases that we want to put our money towards. So I'm not going to give you our R&D time line right now or our priorities, but we're in the process of doing that. We -- as we've talked before, I think the opportunities across the Tyler solutions is pretty expansive on the disbursement side. We've talked before, I think, as big as on the acquiring side. But currently, right now, the focus is primarily still in the courts area.\nA \u2013Brian Miller:Yes. And on the expectations for growth rates around payments, at Investor Day, we broadly talked about an expectation of transaction revenues growing in the 10% to 13% range and expanding margins there over the next several years. As we've said, we're in the very early innings of executing on the cross-sell opportunity of driving payments more deeply into our local government customer base. And so we're still ramping that up, seeing good success in expanding those numbers of new deals each quarter. But generally, that 10% to 13% CAGR for transaction revenues is our expectation over the next few years. Yes, sure, Jonathan. Obviously, it's a pretty rapidly evolving landscape. There's a lot that's in the news, some of it may be a little more hype. But it's real. And we see AI benefits within Tyler, we're kind of looking at it in two different ways. We're looking at it sort of pointing it internally, things that we're doing, how can we make ourselves more efficient by using AI. Because I think one of the biggest benefits around AI really is when you're talking about sort of high-volume repetitive tasks, which there are pieces of our business that do that, whether it's some software coding, it may be some things around some support, things like that. The other side of it is how do we make our products more competitive and differentiate them more? What we've done internally is we've organized a working group that's been in place for several quarters, looking at all the various opportunities. There's pockets of AI going on all around Tyler right now. We want to take -- not surprisingly, what we always do at Tyler is sort of a deliberate targeted approach. Sort of we're in the process of identifying what are the couple of key areas that we want to focus on in both of those scenarios, whether we're pointing it internally around creating more efficiencies or adding more competitiveness to our products. The CSI acquisition is a great example of that. They really started off as a sort of a document redaction sort of extraction leader. Recently, they've added some machine learning and robotic process automation. This is something that all of our core clients need and some of our core clients were already using. Tarrant County, which is here out in Fort Worth, they've utilized the CSI acquisition and what it saved in their personnel costs, this is their numbers not mine. they're saying they've cut their labor costs by 50% by sort of automating some of these more repetitive things around documents which, of course, there's a lot there. So even the CSI acquisition, we were just talking earlier the Rapid acquisition. Initially, it's in the court space, that's where we're pointing it. But we also see a lot of places and leverage it across other platforms in Tyler, whether it's things in our ERP space like invoice processing and things like that. So a lot of applicability. You're right, states and clients are -- they're taking different approaches, and we're going to take that deliberate approach with our clients. Yeah. Thanks, Kelly. I would say it's been a strong year. And I would say we characterize that in the first half of the year is very strong. And I would say it's -- right now, it's steady at that pace. Overall, the markets just seem healthy. The budgets are still strong. The activity is strong and our win rates are good. So I don't see any real meaningful change across our business lines from comments we've made in the first couple of quarters. Yeah. Thanks, David. Sure. As you know, we've been prioritizing debt paydown a lot at the same time while we're still looking at other deals. I'm excited to -- once we dropped under 1.5 net leverage, our rate in our bank changed, and we were able to achieve that at the end of Q3. So that's encouraging. We've paid over about $1 billion of debt down. Brian talked earlier about the impact of Section 174 taxes and the pro forma free cash flow. We'd actually be out of term debt or pretty close to out of term debt right now, absent that, which is encouraging. As it relates to private market valuations there, I would say there's -- we're starting to see in the market and the deals and the things that we're hearing that expectations are finally starting to change. It's always been a little bit amazing to me that when you see things going on in the public markets and yet the private sector deals or people still think that the market should be where it was a couple of years ago. We're still pretty disciplined in how we look at acquisitions. So in areas when private expectations still are too high, we'll simply pass on the deal. We're pretty excited to get these 3 deals done, 1 in Q3 and the ones that we announced earlier this week. These are good deals. These are good business deals, things that are going to help drive our growth, things that will leverage the growth drivers that we outlined in Tyler 2030. And they're going to be accretive to revenues and margins over in pretty short order. So it's interesting, too. There's a lot of companies went private equity in the last few years. And I think we're going to start seeing a time when we're going to start spinning back out. And historically, I think they paid pretty high premiums. It's going to be interesting to see what happens in the markets, but our disciplined approach to how we do things isn't going to change. I think the short answer is no, I don't have any preliminary thoughts on it. Obviously, we watch all these types of things that are going on in the markets, particularly as we think about our long-term plans and views. I'm certainly not in a position to think one way or the other of where -- what anybody in Washington is going to do a little on the Fed. But -- so I'd say right now, I don't have any real comment on that. Yeah, I'd say right now we're on track for what we outlined. We expect our Dallas Center to shut down sort of middle of 2024. And yes, we're still on track for evacuating the other one by the end of 2025. Well, yes, I mean, security is always an issue and particularly in our business and our clients. I think the thing about what's been going on with cybersecurity is it really highlights the need for our clients to move away from their traditional on-prem type environments, move to the cloud, move to the modernization and digitization efforts. And I think it contributes to that. We've seen clients where -- I talked about it, I think, a couple of quarters ago, we had a client that we were trying to move to a SaaS flip for -- out in Arizona for quite a long time. And unfortunately, they had a ransomware attack, and it was surely after that that we were able to flip them to the cloud. It was a triggering point for their decision. So it's a reality that we all have to live with, and our clients are acutely aware of it because a lot of the public sector clients are targets. But I do think it does help with the sales and understanding about where we need to go in the future together with our clients. Thanks, Aaron, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to reach out to Brian Miller or myself. Have a great day."

Also, in our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We've also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financials tab schedules with supplemental information, including information about our quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues. On the Events and Presentations tab, we posted an earnings summary slide deck to supplement our prepared remarks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?\nLynn Moore : Thanks, Hala. Tyler delivered exceptionally strong second quarter results that exceeded expectations across our key performance measures. We also reached a new milestone for total quarterly revenues surpassing the $500 million mark for the first time. Our results reflect a high level of execution and collaborative one Tyler approach across our organization that is the foundation of our long-term growth strategy. Total revenue growth was 7.6% with 10.4% organic growth. Recurring revenue comprised 82% of our quarterly revenues and grew organically almost 11%. It's gratifying to achieve double-digit revenue growth even as the shift to SaaS in our new software contract mix continue to accelerate, with SaaS deals comprising 82% of our Q2 new software contract value. Most importantly, SaaS revenues grew organically 20%, our tenth consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more. At the start of the year, we characterized 2023 as a pivotal year in our cloud transition where the significant decline in license revenue is replaced by valuable long-term recurring SaaS revenue. Now halfway through the year, the accelerated pace of cloud adoption coupled with our heightened focus on our cloud optimization and migration efforts position us well to drive sustained long-term growth and operating margin improvement. While operating margins this quarter declined from last year as expected due to our cloud transitions, margins were better than planned because of operating efficiencies. We continue to deliver results that reflect our competitive strengths and market-leading position in the public sector. Key to our performance is our hyper focus on leveraging our largest asset, our unmatched installed client base to drive an increasing number of cross-sell and upsell wins, prioritize migration of on-premises clients to the cloud and capture higher transaction volumes through our unified payment solution. Overall, sales activity is high in what we see as a robust demand environment, with leading indicators such as RFPs and demos generally at or above pre-COVID highs. In addition to software solutions, our unified payment strategy in our Digital Solutions division continued to prove their tremendous value to our growth algorithm. During the second quarter, we signed 132 new payment deals, including a contract with Cook County, Illinois for traffic court payments. We also signed renewals of our state enterprise contracts in Wisconsin and Connecticut, and extensions of our state enterprise agreements in West Virginia, Illinois, Idaho, New Jersey and Kentucky. Additionally, synergies from our disbursements business through our acquisition of Rapid Financial Solutions, and deals influenced by data and insights continue to materialize and provide compelling offerings in the state and federal markets. I'd like to highlight a few strategic second quarter deals that illustrate these successes. We've seen growing momentum in the public safety market with our best first half sales performance since we acquired New World in 2015. During the second quarter, we signed contracts with 2 state police organizations for enterprise CAD and mobility solutions. These marquee license agreements include a cloud deployment for the Oregon State Police and an on-premises deployment for the Missouri State Highway Patrol. Additionally, Harris County, Texas, the third largest county in the United States, selected Tyler's enforcement mobile solution for eCitations and eCrash applications. We want a cross-sell opportunity with Michigan Bureau of Elections, a Digital Solutions division client to replace an existing custom solution with Tyler's application platform, formerly entellitrak with $1.7 million of ARR. We also added our enterprise licensing platform and 1 outdoor solution under our state enterprise agreement in Illinois with $5.2 million of ARR. 94 clients signed contracts to migrate on-premises Tyler solutions to the cloud, including the Cab County, Georgia, for their enterprise justice solution; Charleston, West Virginia for their enterprise ERP solution and the Wyoming State control for their public safety solution. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2023.\nBrian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Total revenues for the quarter were $504.3 million, up 7.6%. Organic revenue growth, which also excludes COVID-related revenues in 2022 was 10.4%. Last year's second quarter included $15.2 million of revenues from COVID-related initiatives at our Digital Solutions division, formerly NIC, all of which ended in 2022. Subscriptions revenues increased 16.4% and organically rose 16%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew 20% to $131.5 million and transaction revenues grew 13.7% to $166.3 million. On an organic basis, transaction revenues grew 12.8%. License revenue declined 34.8% as our new software contract mix continued to shift to SaaS at an accelerated pace with SaaS deals comprising 82% of our Q2 new software contract value compared to 74% last year. Professional services revenue declined 7.7% due to the absence of COVID-related revenues but rose 12.9% organically. We added 170 new SaaS arrangements and converted 94 existing on-premises clients to SaaS, with a total contract value of approximately $93 million. In Q2 of last year, we added 167 new SaaS arrangements and had 96 on-premises conversions, with a total contract value of approximately $115 million. As a reminder, in last year's second quarter, we signed a $20 million SaaS contract for a digital motor vehicle titling solution in New Jersey. Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.66 billion up 11.2% and organically grew 11.6%. Operating margins in the quarter were once again pressured by the acceleration of the shift to the cloud in new business and the related decline in license revenues. We've also seen expenses associated with employee health benefits grow well above planned levels during the first half of the year, and we remain cautious about future increases for the balance of the year and next year. As we previously stated, we expect operating margins to trough in 2023 and the return to a trajectory of margin expansion in 2024. As we also discussed in prior quarters, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins. In Q2, we paid merchant fees of approximately $44 million. If those fees were netted out of both revenues and cost of revenues, our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter would have been approximately 220 basis points higher. Both cash flows from operations and free cash flow were negative this quarter at $19.2 million negative and $33.2 million, respectively, mainly due to incremental cash tax payments of approximately $90 million related to the current status of IRC Section 174 capitalization rules. On a pro forma basis, excluding the Section 174 cash taxes, our year-to-date free cash flow would be approximately $120 million, up 19% over last year. We did not pay down term debt in Q2 due to the elevated cash tax payments, but we expect to continue to prioritize debt payments as our cash flow accelerates in the second half of the year. We ended Q2 with total outstanding debt of $875 million and cash and investments of approximately $148 million and net leverage at quarter end of approximately 1.55x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. Our updated 2023 guidance is as follows: We expect total revenues will be between $1.94 billion and $1.965 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8%. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.87 and $4.02 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option activity on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.60 and $7.75. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $25 million including approximately $5 million of noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q2 earnings deck posted on our website. In conjunction with our guidance for the full year, I'd like to remind you of the seasonality around our transaction revenues. While transaction revenues will grow year-over-year, we expect they will decline sequentially in Q3 and again in Q4. Historically, transaction revenues are driven by 2 primary factors: They determine deadlines like corporate filings and hunting seasons and the number of business days. Transaction revenues typically are at the highest in Q2 coinciding with peak outdoor seasons and tax deadlines. Transactions are at a seasonal low in the fourth quarter with fewer business days and less activity around the holidays. In addition, starting in Q3, we'll see the revenue impact of contractual changes in one of our state enterprise agreements that includes a move from a gross to net model for payments. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.\nLynn Moore : Thanks, Brian. We finished a strong quarter and first half performance excelled across our business. The quarter was highlighted by 2 highly successful events: Connect 2023, which was our most attended user conference to date with nearly 6,000 attendees and our first stand-alone investor event in 4 years, where we unveiled our Tyler 2030 vision and key growth pillars driving our strategic direction toward organic recurring revenue long-term CAGR of 10% to 12%, sustainable margin expansion with non-GAAP operating margins of 30% or greater and expanded free cash flow of $1 billion and free cash flow margins in the high 20s. If you didn't attend our Investor Day in person or virtually, we invite you to watch the replay or access the presentations on our website. It's an exciting time in Tyler's next era of growth, and we see a clear pathway to achieve our mid- and long-term goals, guided by a well-defined growth strategy and powerful financial algorithm to deliver sustained value creation and support our public sector clients digitally empowered future. Now we'd like to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Pete Heckmann from D.A. Davidson.\nPete Heckmann: Can you talk a little bit about the ERP business and whether you've seen any changing dynamics there competitively. I always thought it was interesting that some of the big horizontal ERP companies really just focused on the top tier. But are you seeing any instances of some players, maybe like Workday coming down into the mid-tier where Tyler has historically been very strong?\nLynn Moore: Yes, sure, Pete. I think to start the background, the ERP market is really strong right now. Market activity is good. It's -- RFPs are up, demos are up. I think we commented on that at the end of the first quarter earnings call. It is a very competitive market. We do see Workday more so at the top end, as you mentioned -- more so in larger deals. And really, we see them more in deals where clients may be driven more from an HR point solution rather than a suite solution, and they compete very well there. We think over the long term that having a suite of products that's fully integrated is the best bet. And we're competing well when we compete on that front.\nPete Heckmann: Okay. And then in terms of like some of the dynamics around in-to-out migrations, it seems like that's continuing a pace. I guess are there any pockets of either certain software products that will need to be upgraded before they can be moved into the cloud or just certain areas where the customer base has maybe been more reluctant where you think they could be hold out in terms of eventually moving to the cloud?\nLynn Moore : Yes. No, that's right. That's one of the -- I think we talked a little bit about that at the investor conference. One of the, I guess, hurdles to getting people into the cloud and getting them upgraded and migrated is -- some of them are on older versions and that's something that we're consciously attacking across all our product lines, trying to get to version collapse. Some divisions are a little more ahead than others. But I think it also sort of highlights what I've said a lot of times is Tyler is not really going through a single cloud transition. It's going through multiple cloud transitions, because we have multiple core applications who are in different stages with different versions out there, different technology, different beginning points, different endpoints. And so it's kind of -- it's a lot of moving parts. But yes, that's certainly a key factor that plays across all of them and different products are in different points right now.\nBrian Miller: And I'll just add to that, that public safety is probably the area that lags both in terms of adoption of new customers of the cloud and migration of existing customers. But that is changing. We're seeing a continuous move towards a higher percentage of the new public safety deals coming to us in the cloud. And this year, we've had our first 2 flips of on-prem public safety clients to the cloud 1 in Q1 and then the Wyoming State Patrol this quarter.\nPete Heckmann : Okay. That\u2019s good to hear. I appreciate it. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew VanVliet from BTIG.\nMatthew VanVliet: I guess as we look at the strength of the SaaS business and especially on the SaaS bookings, I wonder if you could help us think through maybe the cadence of the bookings throughout the quarter? Were they a little bit more back-end weighted? or anything from sort of a timing perspective? And then a second part there is we seem to have seen some of the best organic growth in a number of quarters here. So business is performing well. But maybe think about why you didn't maybe raise the midpoint of the revenue guidance for the year, just sort of what went into the process of essentially maintaining the midpoint on the guidance there.\nBrian Miller: Yes. I\u2019d say the cadence of bookings has been pretty normal. Our bookings typically are not terribly back-end loaded. They tend to be \u2013 within a quarter, they tend to be generally spread throughout the quarter. We obviously have some push to get things in at the end of the quarter, but probably different than some of the businesses, software businesses that are focused on the private sector. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything unusual this quarter. As we said, it continues to be a pretty robust market with a lot of activity. In terms of the revenue guidance, typically, we\u2019re not making big changes in that through the early part of the year. We did narrow the range. So more confident around where the bottom end and the top end are, but our expectations really haven\u2019t changed. It\u2019s more around the timing. This quarter, there were a few deals that happened maybe a little earlier than we planned in the year, but our outlook for the full year really hasn\u2019t changed much of then to narrow.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman from Truist Securities.\nTerry Tillman: And maybe, Lynn, first question for you is in terms of unified payments and you called out 132 payment deals. I'm just curious on that kind of revenue synergy side and now taking into account new use cases around disbursements. How does the back half look in terms of kind of building confidence in these revenue synergies? And can you keep building on top of like 132 payment deals as we move into 3Q and beyond just a little bit more around -- could we see more goodness where you've seen so far?\nLynn Moore: Yes. Terry, that's a good question. I think payments is an area where it continues to even outbeat our internal plan. And so my expectation is that's going to continue. It's something that we push with every deal. It's the more that we get involved, it's also involved in a lot of our inside sales, which also continues to outpace quarter after quarter. As it relates to Rapid, we're still pretty early. We're what 9 months, 8 months into the Rapid acquisition. We've got a lot of good traction. We've got a lot of deals that are in the works that are really pretty exciting deals that we wouldn't have without Rapid and that are going to add really some extra revenues down the road. So where we are with payments right now is I'm excited about where we are. I'm really excited about the Rapid deal. It's something that's being pushed throughout our entire sales channel, and I would expect that to continue to grow.\nBrian Miller: And I would point out that there is a lag typically from the time we sign a new payments deal to the time those revenues start hitting the income statement. It might be a quarter or 2, it might be longer. They often -- we're replacing an incumbent payments provider and so there may be some time period for that change to take place? Or the payments are associated with the implementation of a new solution like the utility billing solution. And so those payments start when that new system is implemented. So the fact that we're continuing to see a growing number of new deals signed, bodes well for future revenue growth in that area, but it is an instant.\nTerry Tillman: Got it. I guess, maybe, Brian, just a follow-up question, and then I'll get back in the queue is -- it was good to call out that the lumpiness in large deal kind of exposure that you all have. So the $20 million deal, if you back it out, I mean the software contract value was down a little bit year-over-year. It sounds like year-to-date, there's been robust demand activity. But I'm just kind of curious, was there smaller large deals in the quarter and compared to maybe last year's 2Q? And then -- and is there anything we should call out into 3Q that you anniversary like a big deal like last year in 2Q?\nBrian Miller: Yes, it was a tough comp from a bookings perspective. This year, our biggest deal was an $8.8 million total contract value in the Michigan Bureau of elections. And we -- on the SaaS side and then we had I guess, 5 other deals that were worth more than $2 million and one large license deal, the Missouri Highway Control deal. Last year, we had the New Jersey deal, which was a $20 million deal. So we don't have anything that approached that size deal this year. And we also had a $13 million license deal with the tax system in Montreal. So there were just a number of large deals last year. This year was much more, I'd say, kind of normal. In Q3, I don't believe we have a meaningful sort of comp issue. I think our biggest license deal was a $2.5 million deal. And we did have -- on the SaaS side, we did have a very large deal with the State Department last year in Q3, which was a total contract value of north of $50 million. And we had a statewide supervision deal, that was a $15 million SaaS deal. So those will make for a difficult comp on the SaaS side next quarter.\nLynn Moore : Yes. I think what's interesting there, Terry, is while there were no huge mega deals this quarter, really across the board, all of our divisions are outperforming plan and what they're seeing in their sales and in their pipeline and in their activity. So typically, there's always puts and takes, but really -- this is really just a strong quarter across the board, both from a revenue standpoint and an execution standpoint.\nBrian Miller: We've talked for a long time about the lumpiness of those mega deals. They come along from time to time. We -- in some of these product areas where like Courts & Justice and tax, we're very well positioned to win those, but they're not here every quarter. So they do create some lumpiness, whether it's SaaS or license bookings.\nTerry Tillman : Understood. Good look into 3Q. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs.\nGabriela Borges: I wanted to follow up on the comment on RFPs and demos now being at or above pre-COVID highs. Would love to get a little bit of color, how much of that is activity changing at the customer versus maybe Tyler specific initiatives? And is there any reason to think that the quality of these RFPs and demos could be better or worse? In other words, how do you think about conversion rates for some of this great top of funnel pipeline activity relative to the history?\nLynn Moore: Yes, Gabriela. I think it's just -- the RFPs and demos up is just a function of the market. And I think there's probably still been a little bit of hangover from COVID, but we're seeing it really across the board, across all of our business units. As it relates to the quality of RFPs, I think there are certain business units where we're actually probably being even a little bit more selective, which I think is going to increase our win rates. I know we're doing that, for example, at public safety. But generally speaking, it's just a healthy market right now.\nBrian Miller: I think it is a combination of both, the strength of the market, I think the stimulus is a factor there, but not the major factor, but also the strength of Tyler's broader presence, the ability for us to leverage our customer relationships and see more opportunities and see some of those opportunities sooner through the NIC state contracts and our ability. We talk about RFPs and demos but a growing number of our deals take place without RFPs. So in sole source or deals that bypass that formal RFP process. So that's a positive for us as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Reilly from Needham.\nJosh Reilly : Nice job on the quarter here. Subscription and maintenance gross margin was higher in the quarter. Maybe you can give us some color on what drove that increase quarter-over-quarter? And how is the cloud migration impacting gross margin near term here versus some of the operating expense line items?\nBrian Miller: Well, I think we continue to see operating efficiencies around a number of aspects of our business, but they\u2019re certainly impacting our recurring revenues and our SaaS business. We\u2019re continuing to be very efficient around managing our staffing levels. We\u2019re seeing some of the efficiency gains, for example, around the Digital Solutions reformer NIC business that from changes that have been made there to operate more efficiently. So as we expect that as the SaaS revenues grow, margins should continue to expand. I think we\u2019re also seeing improved efficiencies around our public cloud, AWS operations and better per unit costs as we add more customers there. So even though we are seeing certainly pressure on margins because of the cloud transition, the things we\u2019ve talked about, the bubble costs around \u2013 until we exit our proprietary data centers, we are seeing efficiency gains around those operations as we continue to scale those.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Brian, maybe just for you. Great to see the SaaS revenue here, I think, continue to grow 20% plus in the quarter. I know that's the CAGR that we talked about at Analyst Day recently, I think, out to '25. So maybe the question is, should we sort of think about this continuing pretty steady in this range in the medium term? Or should we think about just maybe a little bit of a different shape around SaaS revenue over the next couple of years? Just curious how you think about kind of this quarter's growth in the context of that long-term target.\nBrian Miller: Yes. I think, in the Investor Day, I think we actually talked about kind of high-teens CAGR over that period collectively from now through 2030. So right now and for the next few years, we'll continue to see a bump to the growth from the flips from our on-prem customers and over time, I mean, that certainly will accelerate over the next few years and then we'll wind down as we talked about the cadence that we expect to convert those customers over. So we are getting higher benefit from those flips and we'll continue to see that. But I think ultimately, it moves more into the teens. But I'd expect to see this growth in this range for the near future.\nSaket Kalia: Got it. And then if I could fit in a housekeeping question. Really interesting point you made in your prepared remarks, Brian, just on having one customer switch from gross to net in the payments business here in Q3. Could you just maybe dig into how much of a revenue impact that is in Q3 that we should think about? And is this going to be more of a trend? Or do you think this is a little bit of a one-off?\nBrian Miller: Yes. I think we actually talked about that at our \u2013 when we gave guidance for the full year. There is 1 state that\u2019s about a $10.5 million that\u2019s changing midyear, so that impact will start to hit this year, and we estimated that at around $10.5 million in the second half of the year, probably a little more of that impact in Q3. It happens really on a state or a customer by customer basis. The vast majority of our business is on the gross model, and we expect that to continue to be the case. Customers generally prefer the certainty and the predictability around having us assume the responsibility for the merchant and interchange fees and have a set percentage that they\u2019re going to pay for their payments processing. There are some customers that are willing to accept that risk around those merchant interchange fees and prefer the net model and sometimes there are changes there as we\u2019ve seen this year. We really \u2013 I think we had 2 states that\u2019s been the case with this year. But again, generally, we would expect that the vast majority of our payments business would continue to be on the gross model.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alek Zukin from Wolfe Research.\nEthan Park: This is Ethan Park on Alek Zukin. I have 2 parts here. Just first, can you talk a little bit about the shape of the quarter, just comment a bit about kind of the environment coming in and out of the Analyst Day. And then just a question on the SaaS works. How did it perform just relative to your internal expectations as we look at about a year versus a year ago and just how to think about that trending through the rest of this year and into 2024.\nBrian Miller: Yes, the demand environment, as we said in the prepared remarks, is stable or growing generally at or above kind of our pre-COVID highs. So a very robust demand environment coming out of Investor Day and really very similar to what we\u2019ve seen throughout this year and don\u2019t see signs of that changing right now. So stable at a high level. With respect to flips, I\u2019d say generally, we\u2019re performing a long plan \u2013 the number of flips is very similar to last year, but the dollar value is higher. So we are seeing bigger customers flip. And I think that will continue to be the case, especially in the early days, flips most of the customers doing that. We\u2019re on the small end today. We\u2019re seeing more of the larger customers. We talked about a couple this quarter that were on the larger side, a large county in Georgia with a court system. As I said, we\u2019ve seen our first couple of public safety customers flip. So I\u2019d say, generally, those migrations are in line with our expectations for the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin: I wanted to go back to something that was asked earlier, but with a slightly different tilt. If we look at the subscription mix as a percent of total contracts, it's very consistent with what we've seen recently. If we look at the TCV and the term metrics, they're down a bit. And this is plus a year-on-year comparison question and more. Just wondering if there's anything to call out in terms of customer behavior, whether it's rising rates or something that might be driving a slightly smaller initial deal size? And then just thinking through if there are impacts that flow into the backlog or bookings numbers that we're looking at. Just wanting to reconcile if there's anything to call out there and just try to kind of calibrate maybe what to expect on those metrics rest of the year?\nBrian Miller: Yes. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything of note around that. The mix of what deals signed in any given quarter can just vary a lot depending on the timing of when those things happen and what happens to be in the pipeline. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a trend to call out or anything, any macro condition that\u2019s affecting. We continue to \u2013 if we look at comparison to last year, I think some of those metrics are skewed a bit by those very large deals. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything really notable to call out there, and I\u2019d expect that \u2013 generally, we expect to continue to see deal sizes grow over time, but it\u2019s hard to predict exactly what will happen in Q3 or Q4. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything fundamentally changing in the market around that.\nLynn Moore: Yes. I think I would add there that generally, there\u2019s a couple of areas in our business that sign larger deals. Appraisal and tax often has some very large deal, multiyear deals. Our Courts & Justice, Enterprise Justice has some very large deals. And the appraisal tax stuff can be a little cyclical. The large deals are \u2013 they come and they go. We\u2019ve talked about it for years. That\u2019s what makes \u2013 that\u2019s the 1 reason why we stopped talking about bookings numbers and started focusing on different metrics. I\u2019d go back to my comment earlier today that really performance across the board has been really solid and actually above plan in Q2, which is pretty exciting to see given as well as our competitive position and sort of the demand nature that\u2019s out there right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI.\nKirk Materne: Question on sort of flips. I was wondering, Lynn, if you could talk a little bit about when customers are considering moving from on-prem to cloud, is that a cross-sell opportunity as well for you all, meaning when they're having that discussion, has that given you all an opportunity to go in and talk about the sort of other products that might hang off the product they're moving to the cloud. I was just wondering if you have any thought process or if there's anything you could share in terms of what percentage of flips come along with incremental revenue associated with it?\nLynn Moore: Yes. No, that's a good point. And you're right. That's a big part of our sales strategy. And I'd say we actually probably call that more of an upsell opportunity. We talk about cross-sells and upsells. It's an opportunity to add things like our data and insight solutions, our payment solutions as well as just other things. So -- and we talked earlier about how a lot of this requires the customers to upgrade to a newer version of the software, which also opens up doors for other modules and things that are more compatible.\nKirk Materne: And can you talk about just in terms of moving to the cloud, obviously, as people start talking more about generative AI and AI in general, to take advantage of you sort of need to be in the cloud. Has that started to percolate at all as a topic of discussion for customers to move over to the cloud? Or is it still just super early days in the public sector?\nLynn Moore: I think from a customer standpoint, the concept of AI is very early days. As you know, our customer base is generally pretty conservative, pretty risk-averse. And I think they probably are more on a wait-and-see approach. Now we at Tyler are not \u2013 we\u2019re not just sitting around taking a wait-and-see approach. We are actively looking at AI. We formed our own AI task committee. We\u2019re actively already using a little bit of AI. We\u2019re looking at things about how it can improv\u2019 some of our internal efficiencies. We're lookin\u2019 at things at how it can improve our competitiveness as well as how it can improve our clients\u2019 efficiency. So we\u2019re looking at that right now. But I would say, from a Tyler perspective, we\u2019re pretty early on. And from a client\u2019s perspective, they\u2019re even earlier on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Charles Strauzer from CJS Securities, Inc.\nCharles Strauzer: Just a quick question. Just it seems like every month or so, there's the high-profile data breach, the latest one being the MOVEit data breach, that has been in the news impacting government clients and private businesses. Have you seen any impact on your business from that? And more importantly, are you seeing opportunities from that as well?\nLynn Moore: Yes. I mean it\u2019s an unfortunate reality of doing business is the world of cybersecurity and breaches. And our clients are not immune to it. I think there\u2019s been a fair number of those over the last couple of years. My guess is for the ones that are publicized, there\u2019s probably even more that are not. It does create opportunities for us. I think it creates opportunities to flip people into the cloud. It\u2019s creating opportunities around, for example, our cybersecurity offering. We didn\u2019t talk a lot about it last year. We had a client last year in Arizona that we had been trying to flip to the cloud for really for some time, and they had a security breach and that was the decision point for them to pull the trigger and flip to the cloud. So again, it\u2019s an unfortunate part of doing business. But I think that also creates opportunities for our clients to move into more secure environments.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: Just wanted to maybe understand some of sort of your comments around seeing some additional out margin pressure around employee increases. Is this a change relative to your prior expectations? And can you maybe walk through some of the dynamics or the details around that?\nLynn Moore: Yes. It's really -- it's not around our labor costs generally or our headcount, it was really more around health care. We budget health care every year. We do the best we can. We model it based on last year's practices. And we've just been experiencing a higher level of employee claims this year than the budget. Last year, I think our employee claims were a little bit below budget. This year, they're trending higher. And we're just trying to grapple with that as we go forward. It's something that we're probably modeling to continue throughout the rest of the year. But there's ebbs and flows as it relates to health care.\nBrian Miller: Yes. There continues to be higher inflation, I think on the health care side, even than in the environment in general, utilization is up, more high claims experience. So \u2013 we continue to monitor it. We believe we have adjusted our expectations for the balance of the year in our guidance. But it is \u2013 I would point out that it\u2019s several million dollars of expense in the first half of the year above what our expectations were. And so I think that makes our \u2013 the performance we\u2019ve turned in for the first half of the year, even more positive. But \u2013 and you see that throughout our margins, but also especially in the SG&A side.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research.\nKeith Housum: Brian, a question for you on your commentary regarding the Public Safety segment having the first -- the best first half of the year. Is there something in the market that's helping to contribute to that? Or is this a market share gain, but how do you guys explain, I guess, your success you're having there?\nLynn Moore: I'd say it's a couple of things, Keith. Market activity is really strong in public safety. We're seeing demos right now are on pace for their highest level in a year that we've seen in a long time. Proposals are up. Our competitive position is good. We've done some internal resets at public safety and really kind of excited about where we are. I mean we landed 3 really large deals this quarter sort of in the range of $1.8 million to $2 million range, which we haven't done in a while. So we're excited about what's going on in public safety. We're excited about where the market is and some of the things we've done internally to capture that market.\nBrian Miller: Yes, the competitive position is -- continues to improve. We've made investments in that product over the last several years. And I think the integration with some of the other acquisitions we've made, like our enforcement mobile product, our data and analytics capabilities are very, very strong. And so all of those things that create a very strong integrated public safety platform along with the integration to our Courts & Justice platform, continue to improve our market position.\nLynn Moore: Yes. Our mobility platform, a big differentiator. And I think what\u2019s also encouraging is that we talked about \u2013 I think Brian mentioned in his remarks earlier, is the fact that the public safety market is really starting to slowly \u2013 I\u2019ll say slowly, but embrace movement to the cloud. It\u2019s been sort of moving in a snails pace. I\u2019m not suggesting it\u2019s going crazy, but we are seeing a lot more receptiveness, which was highlighted by some of the deals we talked about earlier.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Lynn Moore for any further remarks.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Colby, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian Miller",
            "content": "Thanks, Lynn. Total revenues for the quarter were $504.3 million, up 7.6%. Organic revenue growth, which also excludes COVID-related revenues in 2022 was 10.4%. Last year's second quarter included $15.2 million of revenues from COVID-related initiatives at our Digital Solutions division, formerly NIC, all of which ended in 2022. Subscriptions revenues increased 16.4% and organically rose 16%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew 20% to $131.5 million and transaction revenues grew 13.7% to $166.3 million. On an organic basis, transaction revenues grew 12.8%. License revenue declined 34.8% as our new software contract mix continued to shift to SaaS at an accelerated pace with SaaS deals comprising 82% of our Q2 new software contract value compared to 74% last year. Professional services revenue declined 7.7% due to the absence of COVID-related revenues but rose 12.9% organically. We added 170 new SaaS arrangements and converted 94 existing on-premises clients to SaaS, with a total contract value of approximately $93 million. In Q2 of last year, we added 167 new SaaS arrangements and had 96 on-premises conversions, with a total contract value of approximately $115 million. As a reminder, in last year's second quarter, we signed a $20 million SaaS contract for a digital motor vehicle titling solution in New Jersey. Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.66 billion up 11.2% and organically grew 11.6%. Operating margins in the quarter were once again pressured by the acceleration of the shift to the cloud in new business and the related decline in license revenues. We've also seen expenses associated with employee health benefits grow well above planned levels during the first half of the year, and we remain cautious about future increases for the balance of the year and next year. As we previously stated, we expect operating margins to trough in 2023 and the return to a trajectory of margin expansion in 2024. As we also discussed in prior quarters, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins. In Q2, we paid merchant fees of approximately $44 million. If those fees were netted out of both revenues and cost of revenues, our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter would have been approximately 220 basis points higher. Both cash flows from operations and free cash flow were negative this quarter at $19.2 million negative and $33.2 million, respectively, mainly due to incremental cash tax payments of approximately $90 million related to the current status of IRC Section 174 capitalization rules. On a pro forma basis, excluding the Section 174 cash taxes, our year-to-date free cash flow would be approximately $120 million, up 19% over last year. We did not pay down term debt in Q2 due to the elevated cash tax payments, but we expect to continue to prioritize debt payments as our cash flow accelerates in the second half of the year. We ended Q2 with total outstanding debt of $875 million and cash and investments of approximately $148 million and net leverage at quarter end of approximately 1.55x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. Our updated 2023 guidance is as follows: We expect total revenues will be between $1.94 billion and $1.965 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8%. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.87 and $4.02 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option activity on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.60 and $7.75. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $25 million including approximately $5 million of noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q2 earnings deck posted on our website. In conjunction with our guidance for the full year, I'd like to remind you of the seasonality around our transaction revenues. While transaction revenues will grow year-over-year, we expect they will decline sequentially in Q3 and again in Q4. Historically, transaction revenues are driven by 2 primary factors: They determine deadlines like corporate filings and hunting seasons and the number of business days. Transaction revenues typically are at the highest in Q2 coinciding with peak outdoor seasons and tax deadlines. Transactions are at a seasonal low in the fourth quarter with fewer business days and less activity around the holidays. In addition, starting in Q3, we'll see the revenue impact of contractual changes in one of our state enterprise agreements that includes a move from a gross to net model for payments. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn. And I'll just add to that, that public safety is probably the area that lags both in terms of adoption of new customers of the cloud and migration of existing customers. But that is changing. We're seeing a continuous move towards a higher percentage of the new public safety deals coming to us in the cloud. And this year, we've had our first 2 flips of on-prem public safety clients to the cloud 1 in Q1 and then the Wyoming State Patrol this quarter. Yes. I'd say the cadence of bookings has been pretty normal. Our bookings typically are not terribly back-end loaded. They tend to be \u2013 within a quarter, they tend to be generally spread throughout the quarter. We obviously have some push to get things in at the end of the quarter, but probably different than some of the businesses, software businesses that are focused on the private sector. So I don't think there's anything unusual this quarter. As we said, it continues to be a pretty robust market with a lot of activity. In terms of the revenue guidance, typically, we're not making big changes in that through the early part of the year. We did narrow the range. So more confident around where the bottom end and the top end are, but our expectations really haven't changed. It's more around the timing. This quarter, there were a few deals that happened maybe a little earlier than we planned in the year, but our outlook for the full year really hasn't changed much of then to narrow. And I would point out that there is a lag typically from the time we sign a new payments deal to the time those revenues start hitting the income statement. It might be a quarter or 2, it might be longer. They often -- we're replacing an incumbent payments provider and so there may be some time period for that change to take place? Or the payments are associated with the implementation of a new solution like the utility billing solution. And so those payments start when that new system is implemented. So the fact that we're continuing to see a growing number of new deals signed, bodes well for future revenue growth in that area, but it is an instant. Yes, it was a tough comp from a bookings perspective. This year, our biggest deal was an $8.8 million total contract value in the Michigan Bureau of elections. And we -- on the SaaS side and then we had I guess, 5 other deals that were worth more than $2 million and one large license deal, the Missouri Highway Control deal. Last year, we had the New Jersey deal, which was a $20 million deal. So we don't have anything that approached that size deal this year. And we also had a $13 million license deal with the tax system in Montreal. So there were just a number of large deals last year. This year was much more, I'd say, kind of normal. In Q3, I don't believe we have a meaningful sort of comp issue. I think our biggest license deal was a $2.5 million deal. And we did have -- on the SaaS side, we did have a very large deal with the State Department last year in Q3, which was a total contract value of north of $50 million. And we had a statewide supervision deal, that was a $15 million SaaS deal. So those will make for a difficult comp on the SaaS side next quarter. We've talked for a long time about the lumpiness of those mega deals. They come along from time to time. We -- in some of these product areas where like Courts & Justice and tax, we're very well positioned to win those, but they're not here every quarter. So they do create some lumpiness, whether it's SaaS or license bookings. I think it is a combination of both, the strength of the market, I think the stimulus is a factor there, but not the major factor, but also the strength of Tyler's broader presence, the ability for us to leverage our customer relationships and see more opportunities and see some of those opportunities sooner through the NIC state contracts and our ability. We talk about RFPs and demos but a growing number of our deals take place without RFPs. So in sole source or deals that bypass that formal RFP process. So that's a positive for us as well. Well, I think we continue to see operating efficiencies around a number of aspects of our business, but they're certainly impacting our recurring revenues and our SaaS business. We're continuing to be very efficient around managing our staffing levels. We're seeing some of the efficiency gains, for example, around the Digital Solutions reformer NIC business that from changes that have been made there to operate more efficiently. So as we expect that as the SaaS revenues grow, margins should continue to expand. I think we're also seeing improved efficiencies around our public cloud, AWS operations and better per unit costs as we add more customers there. So even though we are seeing certainly pressure on margins because of the cloud transition, the things we've talked about, the bubble costs around \u2013 until we exit our proprietary data centers, we are seeing efficiency gains around those operations as we continue to scale those. Yes. I think, in the Investor Day, I think we actually talked about kind of high-teens CAGR over that period collectively from now through 2030. So right now and for the next few years, we'll continue to see a bump to the growth from the flips from our on-prem customers and over time, I mean, that certainly will accelerate over the next few years and then we'll wind down as we talked about the cadence that we expect to convert those customers over. So we are getting higher benefit from those flips and we'll continue to see that. But I think ultimately, it moves more into the teens. But I'd expect to see this growth in this range for the near future. Yes. I think we actually talked about that at our \u2013 when we gave guidance for the full year. There is 1 state that's about a $10.5 million that's changing midyear, so that impact will start to hit this year, and we estimated that at around $10.5 million in the second half of the year, probably a little more of that impact in Q3. It happens really on a state or a customer by customer basis. The vast majority of our business is on the gross model, and we expect that to continue to be the case. Customers generally prefer the certainty and the predictability around having us assume the responsibility for the merchant and interchange fees and have a set percentage that they're going to pay for their payments processing. There are some customers that are willing to accept that risk around those merchant interchange fees and prefer the net model and sometimes there are changes there as we've seen this year. We really \u2013 I think we had 2 states that's been the case with this year. But again, generally, we would expect that the vast majority of our payments business would continue to be on the gross model. Yes, the demand environment, as we said in the prepared remarks, is stable or growing generally at or above kind of our pre-COVID highs. So a very robust demand environment coming out of Investor Day and really very similar to what we've seen throughout this year and don't see signs of that changing right now. So stable at a high level. With respect to flips, I'd say generally, we're performing a long plan \u2013 the number of flips is very similar to last year, but the dollar value is higher. So we are seeing bigger customers flip. And I think that will continue to be the case, especially in the early days, flips most of the customers doing that. We're on the small end today. We're seeing more of the larger customers. We talked about a couple this quarter that were on the larger side, a large county in Georgia with a court system. As I said, we've seen our first couple of public safety customers flip. So I'd say, generally, those migrations are in line with our expectations for the year. Yes. I don't think there's anything of note around that. The mix of what deals signed in any given quarter can just vary a lot depending on the timing of when those things happen and what happens to be in the pipeline. So I don't think there's a trend to call out or anything, any macro condition that's affecting. We continue to \u2013 if we look at comparison to last year, I think some of those metrics are skewed a bit by those very large deals. But I don't think there's anything really notable to call out there, and I'd expect that \u2013 generally, we expect to continue to see deal sizes grow over time, but it's hard to predict exactly what will happen in Q3 or Q4. But I don't think there's anything fundamentally changing in the market around that. Yes. There continues to be higher inflation, I think on the health care side, even than in the environment in general, utilization is up, more high claims experience. So \u2013 we continue to monitor it. We believe we have adjusted our expectations for the balance of the year in our guidance. But it is \u2013 I would point out that it's several million dollars of expense in the first half of the year above what our expectations were. And so I think that makes our \u2013 the performance we've turned in for the first half of the year, even more positive. But \u2013 and you see that throughout our margins, but also especially in the SG&A side. Yes, the competitive position is -- continues to improve. We've made investments in that product over the last several years. And I think the integration with some of the other acquisitions we've made, like our enforcement mobile product, our data and analytics capabilities are very, very strong. And so all of those things that create a very strong integrated public safety platform along with the integration to our Courts & Justice platform, continue to improve our market position."

            "content": "Thanks, Hala. Tyler delivered exceptionally strong second quarter results that exceeded expectations across our key performance measures. We also reached a new milestone for total quarterly revenues surpassing the $500 million mark for the first time. Our results reflect a high level of execution and collaborative one Tyler approach across our organization that is the foundation of our long-term growth strategy. Total revenue growth was 7.6% with 10.4% organic growth. Recurring revenue comprised 82% of our quarterly revenues and grew organically almost 11%. It's gratifying to achieve double-digit revenue growth even as the shift to SaaS in our new software contract mix continue to accelerate, with SaaS deals comprising 82% of our Q2 new software contract value. Most importantly, SaaS revenues grew organically 20%, our tenth consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more. At the start of the year, we characterized 2023 as a pivotal year in our cloud transition where the significant decline in license revenue is replaced by valuable long-term recurring SaaS revenue. Now halfway through the year, the accelerated pace of cloud adoption coupled with our heightened focus on our cloud optimization and migration efforts position us well to drive sustained long-term growth and operating margin improvement. While operating margins this quarter declined from last year as expected due to our cloud transitions, margins were better than planned because of operating efficiencies. We continue to deliver results that reflect our competitive strengths and market-leading position in the public sector. Key to our performance is our hyper focus on leveraging our largest asset, our unmatched installed client base to drive an increasing number of cross-sell and upsell wins, prioritize migration of on-premises clients to the cloud and capture higher transaction volumes through our unified payment solution. Overall, sales activity is high in what we see as a robust demand environment, with leading indicators such as RFPs and demos generally at or above pre-COVID highs. In addition to software solutions, our unified payment strategy in our Digital Solutions division continued to prove their tremendous value to our growth algorithm. During the second quarter, we signed 132 new payment deals, including a contract with Cook County, Illinois for traffic court payments. We also signed renewals of our state enterprise contracts in Wisconsin and Connecticut, and extensions of our state enterprise agreements in West Virginia, Illinois, Idaho, New Jersey and Kentucky. Additionally, synergies from our disbursements business through our acquisition of Rapid Financial Solutions, and deals influenced by data and insights continue to materialize and provide compelling offerings in the state and federal markets. I'd like to highlight a few strategic second quarter deals that illustrate these successes. We've seen growing momentum in the public safety market with our best first half sales performance since we acquired New World in 2015. During the second quarter, we signed contracts with 2 state police organizations for enterprise CAD and mobility solutions. These marquee license agreements include a cloud deployment for the Oregon State Police and an on-premises deployment for the Missouri State Highway Patrol. Additionally, Harris County, Texas, the third largest county in the United States, selected Tyler's enforcement mobile solution for eCitations and eCrash applications. We want a cross-sell opportunity with Michigan Bureau of Elections, a Digital Solutions division client to replace an existing custom solution with Tyler's application platform, formerly entellitrak with $1.7 million of ARR. We also added our enterprise licensing platform and 1 outdoor solution under our state enterprise agreement in Illinois with $5.2 million of ARR. 94 clients signed contracts to migrate on-premises Tyler solutions to the cloud, including the Cab County, Georgia, for their enterprise justice solution; Charleston, West Virginia for their enterprise ERP solution and the Wyoming State control for their public safety solution. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2023. Thanks, Brian. We finished a strong quarter and first half performance excelled across our business. The quarter was highlighted by 2 highly successful events: Connect 2023, which was our most attended user conference to date with nearly 6,000 attendees and our first stand-alone investor event in 4 years, where we unveiled our Tyler 2030 vision and key growth pillars driving our strategic direction toward organic recurring revenue long-term CAGR of 10% to 12%, sustainable margin expansion with non-GAAP operating margins of 30% or greater and expanded free cash flow of $1 billion and free cash flow margins in the high 20s. If you didn't attend our Investor Day in person or virtually, we invite you to watch the replay or access the presentations on our website. It's an exciting time in Tyler's next era of growth, and we see a clear pathway to achieve our mid- and long-term goals, guided by a well-defined growth strategy and powerful financial algorithm to deliver sustained value creation and support our public sector clients digitally empowered future. Now we'd like to open the line for Q&A. Yes, sure, Pete. I think to start the background, the ERP market is really strong right now. Market activity is good. It's -- RFPs are up, demos are up. I think we commented on that at the end of the first quarter earnings call. It is a very competitive market. We do see Workday more so at the top end, as you mentioned -- more so in larger deals. And really, we see them more in deals where clients may be driven more from an HR point solution rather than a suite solution, and they compete very well there. We think over the long term that having a suite of products that's fully integrated is the best bet. And we're competing well when we compete on that front. Yes. No, that's right. That's one of the -- I think we talked a little bit about that at the investor conference. One of the, I guess, hurdles to getting people into the cloud and getting them upgraded and migrated is -- some of them are on older versions and that's something that we're consciously attacking across all our product lines, trying to get to version collapse. Some divisions are a little more ahead than others. But I think it also sort of highlights what I've said a lot of times is Tyler is not really going through a single cloud transition. It's going through multiple cloud transitions, because we have multiple core applications who are in different stages with different versions out there, different technology, different beginning points, different endpoints. And so it's kind of -- it's a lot of moving parts. But yes, that's certainly a key factor that plays across all of them and different products are in different points right now. Yes. Terry, that's a good question. I think payments is an area where it continues to even outbeat our internal plan. And so my expectation is that's going to continue. It's something that we push with every deal. It's the more that we get involved, it's also involved in a lot of our inside sales, which also continues to outpace quarter after quarter. As it relates to Rapid, we're still pretty early. We're what 9 months, 8 months into the Rapid acquisition. We've got a lot of good traction. We've got a lot of deals that are in the works that are really pretty exciting deals that we wouldn't have without Rapid and that are going to add really some extra revenues down the road. So where we are with payments right now is I'm excited about where we are. I'm really excited about the Rapid deal. It's something that's being pushed throughout our entire sales channel, and I would expect that to continue to grow. Yes. I think what's interesting there, Terry, is while there were no huge mega deals this quarter, really across the board, all of our divisions are outperforming plan and what they're seeing in their sales and in their pipeline and in their activity. So typically, there's always puts and takes, but really -- this is really just a strong quarter across the board, both from a revenue standpoint and an execution standpoint. Yes, Gabriela. I think it's just -- the RFPs and demos up is just a function of the market. And I think there's probably still been a little bit of hangover from COVID, but we're seeing it really across the board, across all of our business units. As it relates to the quality of RFPs, I think there are certain business units where we're actually probably being even a little bit more selective, which I think is going to increase our win rates. I know we're doing that, for example, at public safety. But generally speaking, it's just a healthy market right now. Yes. I think I would add there that generally, there's a couple of areas in our business that sign larger deals. Appraisal and tax often has some very large deal, multiyear deals. Our Courts & Justice, Enterprise Justice has some very large deals. And the appraisal tax stuff can be a little cyclical. The large deals are \u2013 they come and they go. We've talked about it for years. That's what makes \u2013 that's the 1 reason why we stopped talking about bookings numbers and started focusing on different metrics. I'd go back to my comment earlier today that really performance across the board has been really solid and actually above plan in Q2, which is pretty exciting to see given as well as our competitive position and sort of the demand nature that's out there right now. Yes. No, that's a good point. And you're right. That's a big part of our sales strategy. And I'd say we actually probably call that more of an upsell opportunity. We talk about cross-sells and upsells. It's an opportunity to add things like our data and insight solutions, our payment solutions as well as just other things. So -- and we talked earlier about how a lot of this requires the customers to upgrade to a newer version of the software, which also opens up doors for other modules and things that are more compatible. I think from a customer standpoint, the concept of AI is very early days. As you know, our customer base is generally pretty conservative, pretty risk-averse. And I think they probably are more on a wait-and-see approach. Now we at Tyler are not \u2013 we're not just sitting around taking a wait-and-see approach. We are actively looking at AI. We formed our own AI task committee. We're actively already using a little bit of AI. We're looking at things about how it can improv' some of our internal efficiencies. We're lookin' at things at how it can improve our competitiveness as well as how it can improve our clients' efficiency. So we're looking at that right now. But I would say, from a Tyler perspective, we're pretty early on. And from a client's perspective, they're even earlier on. Yes. I mean it's an unfortunate reality of doing business is the world of cybersecurity and breaches. And our clients are not immune to it. I think there's been a fair number of those over the last couple of years. My guess is for the ones that are publicized, there's probably even more that are not. It does create opportunities for us. I think it creates opportunities to flip people into the cloud. It's creating opportunities around, for example, our cybersecurity offering. We didn't talk a lot about it last year. We had a client last year in Arizona that we had been trying to flip to the cloud for really for some time, and they had a security breach and that was the decision point for them to pull the trigger and flip to the cloud. So again, it's an unfortunate part of doing business. But I think that also creates opportunities for our clients to move into more secure environments. Yes. It's really -- it's not around our labor costs generally or our headcount, it was really more around health care. We budget health care every year. We do the best we can. We model it based on last year's practices. And we've just been experiencing a higher level of employee claims this year than the budget. Last year, I think our employee claims were a little bit below budget. This year, they're trending higher. And we're just trying to grapple with that as we go forward. It's something that we're probably modeling to continue throughout the rest of the year. But there's ebbs and flows as it relates to health care. I'd say it's a couple of things, Keith. Market activity is really strong in public safety. We're seeing demos right now are on pace for their highest level in a year that we've seen in a long time. Proposals are up. Our competitive position is good. We've done some internal resets at public safety and really kind of excited about where we are. I mean we landed 3 really large deals this quarter sort of in the range of $1.8 million to $2 million range, which we haven't done in a while. So we're excited about what's going on in public safety. We're excited about where the market is and some of the things we've done internally to capture that market. Yes. Our mobility platform, a big differentiator. And I think what's also encouraging is that we talked about \u2013 I think Brian mentioned in his remarks earlier, is the fact that the public safety market is really starting to slowly \u2013 I'll say slowly, but embrace movement to the cloud. It's been sort of moving in a snails pace. I'm not suggesting it's going crazy, but we are seeing a lot more receptiveness, which was highlighted by some of the deals we talked about earlier. Thanks, Colby, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Have a good day."

Your host for today\u2019s call is Lynn Moore, President and CEO of Tyler Technologies. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, April 27, 2023. I would like to turn the call over to Hala Elsherbini, Tyler Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nHala Elsherbini: Thank you, Davin, and welcome to our call. With me today is Lynn Moore, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. After I give the Safe Harbor statement. Lynn will have some initial comments on our quarter, and then Brian will review the details of our results and provide our annual guidance. Lynn will end with some additional comments, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. During this conference call, the management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company\u2019s future prospects, revenues, expenses, and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Also, in our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We have also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financials tab schedules with supplemental information, including information about quarterly bookings, backlog and recurring revenues.  On the Events and Presentations tab, we posted an earnings summary slide deck to supplement our prepared remarks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Hala. We began 2023 by delivering strong first quarter results that met or exceeded our expectations for most key metrics. We continue to see broad-based demand across our product solutions, reflecting strength in the public sector market and our unique ability to support our public sector client\u2019s digital modernization needs. We're seeing a high level of request for proposal and demo activity across our software business with particularly strong activity in the ERP space. Our mix of new software business also demonstrates how our market continues to embrace the move to the cloud. Total revenue growth was 3.5% with 7.2% organic growth, which also excludes COVID-related revenues and recurring revenues comprised nearly 84% of our quarterly revenues. We're pleased with our solid revenue growth even as the shift to SaaS and our new software mix continued to accelerate, with SaaS deals comprising 87% of our Q1 new software contract value compared to 80% last year. Most importantly, SaaS revenues grew organically at 24.4%. Our sales activity this quarter reflected strong cross-selling success including opportunities driven by leveraging state relationships at our Digital Solutions division, formerly NIC, and upsells with our data and insight solutions. In addition to our current quarter wins, our pipeline of cross-sell opportunities continues to grow. We also continue to execute our growth strategy around our payments business. During the first quarter, we signed more than 120 new payment deals, and we are especially pleased with the early traction that we are gaining with our acquisition of Rapid Financial Solutions and their robust payment issuing capabilities. I'd like to highlight a couple of first quarter deals that illustrate these successes. In Indiana, we expanded the relationship between Indiana's family and social services administration and our Digital Solutions division with a contract for Tyler's Disbursement as a Service platform to improve the payment disbursement process for sending its existing child care and development fund payments to providers. The purpose of the CCDS federal program is to increase the availability, affordability and quality of childcare. Leveraging the capabilities from the Rapid acquisition, in combination with our existing state enterprise contract, we will streamline the entire disbursement process from portal setup, including registering users and collecting banking information from providers to virtual account payments across all payment types and channels. Through Rapid's robust platform, the solution will also provide reporting and reconciliation features to support complete oversight of the payment program. In addition, we signed two payments contracts to provide rapid disbursement solution for court funds, including Fort Bend County, Texas, a current user of Tyler's jury management solution and Shelby County, Tennessee, a current Tyler Enterprise courts client. The quarter's largest SaaS deal valued at approximately $18.5 million was with the province of New Brunswick in Canada for our enterprise assessment solution. New Brunswick becomes the fourth Canadian province to implement our flagship property tax solution. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2023.\nBrian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023. Total revenues for the quarter were $471.9 million, up 3.5%. Organic revenue growth, which also excludes COVID-related revenues was 7.2%. Last year's first quarter included $20.6 million of revenues from COVID-related initiatives, at our Digital Solutions division, formerly NIC, all of which ended in 2022. License revenue declined 39% as our new software contract mix continued to shift to SaaS at an accelerated pace. Professional services revenue declined 13% due to completion of COVID initiatives, but rose 4.7% organically. Subscriptions revenue increased 14.3% and organically rose 16.4%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew 24.4% to $126.6 million and transaction revenues grew 7.1% to $153.9 million. On an organic basis, which also excludes COVID-related revenues, Transaction revenues grew 13.1%. We added 145 new SaaS arrangements and converted 73 existing on-premises clients to SaaS with a total new software contract value of approximately $86 million. In Q1 of last year, we added 149 new SaaS arrangements and had 88 on-premises conversions, with the total new software contract value of approximately $76 million. Our new SaaS bookings in the first quarter added $17.1 million in new ARR. Our total ARR was approximately -- I'm sorry, $1.58 billion, up 9.1% and organically grew 11.5%. Since Q4 of last year, SaaS revenues now exceed our maintenance revenues. Operating margins in the quarter were once again pressured by the acceleration of the shift to the cloud in the new business and the related decline in license revenues. As we've previously stated, we expect operating margin to trough in 2023 and to return to a trajectory of margin expansion in 2024. As we also discussed last quarter, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins. In Q1, we paid merchant fees of approximately $42 million. If those fees were netted out of both revenues and cost of revenues, our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter would have been approximately 200 basis points higher. Cash flow was robust this quarter with cash flow from operations of $74.7 million, up 39.5% and free cash flow of $63.6 million up 55.1%. As a reminder, cash flow for the balance of the year will be impacted by an estimated $131 million of cash tax payments resulting from the Section 174 tax changes, of which $73 million is related to 2022 taxes and $58 million is related to 2023 estimated taxes. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet as we repaid $120 million of floating rate term debt during the first quarter. We ended Q1 with total outstanding debt of $875 million and cash and investments of approximately $174.2 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 1.52 times trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. Our revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the year are unchanged. Our 2023 guidance is as follows: we expect total revenues will be between $1.935 billion and $1.970 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8%.  We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.65 and $3.80 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option activity on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.50 and $7.65. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $26 million including approximately $5 million of noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.\nLynn Moore : Thanks, Brian. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strong momentum we are building across our business. Our cloud transition initiatives are on track in this pivotal year as we make progress with our move from Tyler's data centers to AWS and managed through expected margin headwinds resulting from the accelerated pace of cloud adoption as well as cloud bubble costs. Our successes in the marketplace reflect our unparalleled competitive strength, synergistic cross-sell and upsell momentum and highly desirable cloud solutions and position us well to execute on our long-term strategic growth road map. In the next few days, we'll release our fourth annual corporate responsibility report. We hope you'll take some time to review it and learn more about the progress we've made with our ESG efforts. To close, we're extremely excited to host clients in person at Connect, our annual user conference, which will take place in San Antonio from May 7 through May 10. Registrations are an all-time high, and this will be our largest connect ever, with some 6,000 public sector clients attending.  We also look forward to our upcoming Investor Day that will be held in person on June 15 in Frisco, Texas, along with a live webcast. We look forward to highlighting our differentiated value proposition in our mid- to long-term strategic plan, growth drivers and financial targets supporting our Tyler 2030 vision. More details will be communicated soon, and we hope you'll be able to join us in person or online. With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ryan [indiscernible] from Credit Suisse Securities USA. Your line is open.\nSami Badri: This is Sami Badri on Ryan's line. The first question I wanted to kick off with was just about operating margins. It looks like you guys did better than what Street and our models were forecasting. And I kind of just want to understand if the mechanism kind of going into the model or into the business, it's allowing you guys to execute a little bit better. Are you seeing better pricing, better cost control? Any other kind of details around the margin beat? And then the other question is, I know that you guys have been messaging about operating margins troughing in 2022 before they expand in 2024. But is it possible that we have already seen your operating margins trough and those are very well understood and you're going to be building and expanding from this point forward maybe from a 2Q base? Can you just give us color on margins, please?\nBrian Miller: Sure. Around the second part of the question, I don't think we've seen the trough yet for the full year. We think the consolidated margin for the full year will be lower this year than it was last year, and our guidance implies that. I do think -- and I don't think Q2 will be the point where you'll see year-over-year margin improvement. I think by Q4, we'd expect that we would be seeing year-over-year margin improvement at that point. But not -- I don't think we've hit the trough yet. And then in terms of the overall margin, we don't give quarterly guidance, so we didn't have a quarterly margin target out there. Our earnings and revenue guidance is basically unchanged from where we started the year. So our expectations at this point are generally consistent. The first quarter did have good performance, good growth around the subscription revenues as some of those revenues are coming online from deals we've signed in prior quarters. And the pace at which those revenues hit can affect that somewhat. I think our subscription revenues were probably a bit above the -- where the Street was. But generally, our expectation for the full year margins hasn't changed.\nLynn Moore: Yes, Sami, I'd add this, too. We've talked a lot over the last couple of years about the cloud transition and the impact on both revenue headwinds and margins, but there's a lot more going on within Tyler. And I'd say right now, there's a lot of intentionality going on at Tyler. It's a little bit more than just sort of sitting back and letting the cloud transition run through the financial analysis. We have a lot of internal analysis, we have a lot of initiatives going on beyond just the cloud transition, taking a look -- deep look at different parts of our business, different things that we should be doing and can be doing. And I really commend our executive team and really our entire staff for the work that's going on right now. There's a lot of work going on at Tyler for sure. But I could say that everybody is sort of aligned generally with what our long-term goals and our long-term vision is and part of that is around margin expansion. So there's just a lot of things going on, a lot of intentionality. There are some bigger pieces. There's smaller things that we're doing. But I think there's just a lot of intentionality going on.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Thanks very much. Lynn, given that you're going to connect next week or next week or in the next couple of weeks, can you just talk about what you're hoping clients take away from that? And I was just kind of curious if you've seen more folks from, say, state governments signing up to participate at the conference?\nLynn Moore: Yes, Kirk, that's a good question. We actually are hosting some special events around our state government clients, and we're going to have a lot of our key state government stakeholders there. We're going to have them introduced to a lot of our executive team. So there'll be sort of a side path going on with them, also be part of the larger forum as well. Connect is just a unique opportunity for us. We've got so many clients. It's a chance for us to sit down and talk to them, talk about our vision, but also listen to them and listen to their needs, hear what their vision is, it's a chance for us to interact. It's a great opportunity for us to help our clients with more training, more information, talk about the new offerings that we have, things that can make their jobs better and more efficient. It's a big event. It takes a lot of work. Our marketing team does -- and events team just does -- it's an amazing job. If anybody hasn't been to it, I'd recommend people go, it's really done in a first-class manner. There's a lot of work that goes into it. It's not an inexpensive event, but it's something that's very worthwhile. I think not only does Tyler and executive team get a lot out of it. I think our clients get a lot out of it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matthew VanVliet from BTIG. Your line is open.\nMatthew VanVliet: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Lynn, on the back of the last question there, you referenced a number of potential pipeline opportunities around some of the state-level contracts. Curious if you could give us some sense of sort of the magnitude of how much you feel like is in sort of the near-term pipeline, where you're actually discussing specific deal terms and things of that nature? And maybe just compared to sort of how much upsell cross-sell has come through those contracts since the acquisition closed and I guess maybe it boils down to sort of what inning or what percentage of those potential opportunities do you think you've realized so far? What's on sort of the near term and then what's maybe more long term in terms of mix? Thanks.\nLynn Moore: Yes, sure, Matthew. I think we're -- part of your question, I think we're still in the early innings. I'd say we're still in the early innings with everything we're doing with NIC. Probably talked a year ago about being in the first inning. We might be in the top of the second. The cross-sell opportunities continue to grow. We take a very deliberate approach around that. We've been instituted this year.  We've been doing the strategic account management meetings where we're getting the Tyler salespeople together with state GMs and really sort of doing what we call sort of a state of the state baseline where we're sort of taking a deep dive and look into what are the objectives in that particular state, what are the relationships NIC, our Digital Solutions division brings, where what's the Tyler product footprint, what's the terms of the contract vehicle, how can we easily get products into those clients' hands. When we talk about what those near-term opportunities are, we do qualify them. I mean we have a number of opportunities that we think are more longer term, but what we call more qualified leads. We're up around sort of in the 175, 180 range right now. All different types of plays that we're looking at there, probably somewhere around $50 million ARR is what we've considered a more qualified pipe. Qualified pipe to me is not something that's going to close in the next month or 2, but it's something that I think has got a pretty viable horizon on it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Reilly of Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nJoshua Reilly: Yes, thanks for taking my question. You mentioned the strong ERP results in the quarter and the pipeline for the rest of the year. Can you just speak to what's driving that pipeline and the visibility that you have in ERP deals for the rest of 2023? Thank you.\nLynn Moore: Yes. I think what I would say there, Josh, was that what we're seeing in terms of the sales indicators, the RFP volume, the number of demos that we're doing is really at almost all-time highs. Now that's not going to turn into business for several quarters, but it's very encouraging to see. I don't really -- I can't really put my finger on what's driving that right now other than the fact that demand remains high and our clients' budgets remain solid.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman of Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nTerry Tillman: Yes, good morning, Lynn and Brian. And Hala thanks for taking my question. Question with a slight follow-up. I guess on the conversions, what I'd be curious, Lynn, has anything evolved or changed in terms of -- as you're doing these flips or conversions, the propensity to maybe do multi-suite then and/or just think much more strategic and broader with the broader product footprint that you've evolved? And then the second part of this is just with Rapid Financial Solutions. It sounds like it's really interesting in terms of kind of 1 plus 1 3. Anything on the quantifying the size of that business now?\nLynn Moore: Sure. I think we certainly use the flips and conversions as an opportunity to upsell. That is part of our strategic direction. We're still going at a pretty healthy pace. I think when we get to Investor Day in June, probably give us -- we'll probably hear a little more guidance on the pace of our conversions and where we think we'll be over the next 4, 5, 6, all the way up to Tyler 2030. But yes, you're exactly right. It's an opportunity for us to once again reach out and upsell other products around and then help incentivize flip to. As it relates to Rapid, this is a transaction that we're pretty excited about. It's a capability that we didn't have in-house. It's not a capability that I didn't have in house, the whole bringing in the whole issuing side of disbursements and the fact that we closed that deal at the end of November. And so we've owned this company for just a little over about 5 months now, not quite 5 months and already the synergies in working with the digital services team, formally NIC, these deals that we've already got signed, I think this early is something a little unusual for us with acquisitions. It normally takes a little bit of time. There's a lot of road map looking out on the disbursement side payments. As you know, they're primarily focused right now sort of in the justice space, but there's applicability across all of our product lines. That again is going to take years to develop, but it's pretty exciting, the early momentum we've seen.\nBrian Miller: And we don't disclose the revenues for Rapid separately, but when we acquired them, they were in the kind of $14 million, $15 million annual revenue range.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Wolfe Research. Your line is open\nUnidentified Analyst : Hey, Guys, this is Alex. So I guess maybe just a quick question -- another quick question on the demand environment. It does seem, Lynn, that you're seeing literally every company kind of talk about the strength of state and local. Is there -- obviously, the budgets have been on a relative basis, better than other sectors, but is there anything unique or special going on? And kind of if you look at your own pace of new SaaS bookings, has that changed at all? Like is it -- is the environment better on a relative basis than where you thought it was going to be? Is it as good as you thought it was going to be? I'd love to get color there. And then just one for Brian around. I appreciate the commentary on operating margin trends through the year. Is there anything you can help us with on free cash flow specifically, I think the $130 million, how that propagates those cash tax payments through the year. And as you're looking at cash conversion on an annual basis, where that falls out?\nLynn Moore: Yes. I think when we talk about what we're seeing in the market, it's a couple of things, probably. I mean we're -- it certainly reinforces the principle that the things that we're providing are essential functionality. I think it reinforces the principle that we went through some periods of time where there might have been a little pent up demand coming out of COVID and also the continued shift towards modernization and digitization of local government. We also see where we talk about the labor markets, for example, and how the labor markets are affecting different companies, but they're also affecting our clients. And as there's labor shortages and turnovers with our clients, it's also creating challenges for our clients, which is having them really point to and use technology to help bridge that gap. So there's just a lot of things going on right now. It's a good market right now. And it's -- I don't know how I'd characterize this to my expectation, but I'm pretty happy with where the market is right now.\nBrian Miller: And on the free cash flow and I think a little bit on the bookings growth that Lynn was just mentioning. It's interesting our overall bookings growth was on an organic basis around 7%. But our subscription bookings on an organic basis were almost 24%, very close to the same number our revenue growth was. So the real strength is in the bookings, both the SaaS and the transaction bookings. On the free cash flow, yes, the $130 million, $131 million estimated incremental cash taxes this year related to Section 174 is a bit higher than we had talked about in the fourth quarter call as we've got more information and gotten into the calculations more. That impact is a little bit higher this year. I think it's $73 million of that applies to really the deposit for last year's taxes about $58 million this year. So that impact does continue to decline each year, but we have a 2-year impact or catch up in this year, but that impact should decline year-over-year until after five years, it sort of neutral. We made -- the biggest piece of that in mid-April. I think it was around $85 million. And then I think the impact is around, I think, in the $15 million range in the -- it's roughly equal in each of the last 3 quarters. On a free cash flow basis, overall, I think our free cash flow margin, excluding the Section 174 impact is, I'd say, the ranges in the kind of 18% to 20% margin range. And including the impact of the free cash flow -- I'm sorry, more in the mid-teens range and including the impact of the Section 174 change, it's kind of high single, low double-digit free cash flow margin. So the impact is pretty meaningful this year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Good morning, Lynn, good morning Brian, thanks for taking my question here. Brian maybe for you. I appreciate the additional disclosure, I think, on SaaS bookings ARR. I think that was what we called in the supplement. And I think that grew mid-single digits this quarter off of a very tough compare. I was just wondering if you could just talk a little bit about how that sort of trend -- how you sort of think about that trending through the year? And maybe just introduce us to that metric a little bit. And then just relatedly, on disclosure, can you just talk about some of the other changes here? Like I think appraisal is a metric that we used to get before. I think that's gotten consolidated somewhere else. Just talk to us a little bit about some of the disclosure changes here and what you want us to focus on in terms of the new?\nBrian Miller: Yes. Appraisal is certainly a much smaller piece of our business. Appraisal Services, it's an important service that we provide often to customers that we also have sold or will sell a property tax system to. But it's now well under 2% of our revenues. And so we've consolidated that line into the professional services line. And again, the focus, as you've seen from some of the things we've talked about really is around subscriptions revenue growth, the recurring revenues. And we've given some detail breaking that out between the SaaS revenues and the transaction-based revenues, which would be things like payments, our digital solutions portal, e-filing those sorts of things. In the SaaS bookings detail, you're correct, it grew sort of mid-single digits. But the -- that's really just referring to basically new logo SaaS deals. So there's additional SaaS bookings in the upsells, pricing increases, inside sales of additional products to existing customers. So the metric we really think is important is the bookings growth number for subscriptions overall, which are the transactions and SaaS revenues, and that was 23.6% this quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pete Heckmann of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nPeter Heckmann: Thank you. Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions. You've done a fabulous job of reducing net leverage post the acquisition of NIC. How are you thinking about the potential for M&A? How does that landscape look as well as valuations? And then really have focused mainly on deleveraging and not so much on the share repurchase plan. I mean what are your thoughts there in terms of resuming share repurchase at some level of net leverage?\nLynn Moore: Yes, sure, Pete. I think you're right. Our focus still continues to be a reduction of debt. We're -- that's our primary focus with our use of capital. It's interesting. Our term debt now is getting closer to 30% of our overall debt. It started off more at 65%. So we're about -- we've kind of flipped that model. We still look at M&A. We still evaluate a lot of M&A opportunities. Clearly, we just did this Rapid Solutions deal last fall. If we see an opportunity like that, where we really believe in the long-term strategic value, we're going to pursue it. I think that's been our take really even when we had a lot higher net leverage profile. That being said, we've got a lot of initiatives going on at Tyler, and we've got a lot of our hands full with a lot of different things. And I could see us continuing to do acquisitions like Rapid, but in terms of a larger sort of more transformational or entering into a whole new space, that's probably not on the near-term horizon.\nOperator: Question comes from the line of Charles Strauzer of CJS Securities, Inc. Your line is open.\nCharles Strauzer: Hi, good morning. Brian, on the last call, you talked about Q1 being similar to Q4 in terms of the EPS, a big ramp in Q2 with the full year guidance essentially unchanged. Should we assume that the ramp in Q2 will be less given that Q1 results were better than expected?\nBrian Miller: Well, I think we'd still be in the same range for the full year. I'd say we're increasingly confident of that range, and we may be trending a little bit more to the upper end of the range at this point, although it's still early in the year. But I think that yes, maybe the ramp is -- I mean I think we were still in the ballpark. We did $1.66. Last year, we did $1.76 in the first quarter, but I think that jump up into Q2 and Q3 and Q4 would be maybe a little less pronounced, but again, we're in the -- pretty much in the same range.\nOperator: Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nMichael Turrin: Thanks, good morning. Appreciate you taking the question. The commentary around the demand environment, RFP volume has remained consistently upbeat. I realize there are some moving pieces, but the organic growth number 7% towards the lower end of the target range. So can you just help us square those things? What is the organic growth number not entirely reflecting relative to the demand backdrop, whether it's pipeline bookings or just general mix and transition impacts? Any context you can provide just around your view on that number is helpful.\nBrian Miller: I'll take a stab at that. I think most of it is around the lag between the time that we sign a new deal and when revenues start to hit the income statement. So when we've talked about our SaaS bookings over recent quarters and this quarter, in particular, being very strong. But there's typically a lag, whether it's a new software deal where it might be a quarter to 2 quarters maybe a little bit longer lags from the time we signed the contract to when the client is -- the environment is set up and we're able to start recognizing revenues and really the same sort of things in many of our transaction-based revenue contracts. We signed a new deal for payments, for example, and there might be perhaps a quarter or so lag between the time those revenues start to get recognized. At the same time, we see the impact of lower licenses immediately because if those were license deals, we would have recognized all that revenue or the majority of that revenue pretty much upfront when very soon after the contract is signed. So that would be the biggest factor there. And it's the same thing with flips from on-prem to the cloud. There's -- we may sign it now, but there's a period of time where that transition takes place, so we don't get the uplift in the revenues immediately.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair & Company. Your line is open.\nJonathan Ho: Hi, good morning. Can you talk a little bit about the data insights opportunity that you referenced in the script? And perhaps what kind of upsell opportunities you're seeing in and around that product grouping? Thank you.\nLynn Moore: Yes, Jonathan. I think I mean data insights is something that -- when I look out in the future of public sector, that's to me is an offering that I can see every single public sector agency needing. It's a very unique offering. We're in a unique position given our big -- our large footprint and our ability to surface data across so many different solutions, not only our own but even non-Tyler solutions. I think it's something that -- look, we made that investment now 5, 6 years ago. And I think we're starting to see more and more demand for it. What we've also seen is internally, we've actually sort of deconstructed the D&I former division within Tyler, and we now sort of have it integrated with each of our divisions so that we're aligning more product with the individual demand, so it's something that I think is a differentiator for us. I think it's always been a differentiator for us. We've seen it even in the last year or so, it's been a differentiator for NIC.  When we talk about a year ago, we were talking about the South Carolina rebid or the early renewal of the Texas payments contract. Those were done in part or primarily or a major factor was our data insights. So it's something that we're going to continue to leverage. I think we're in a unique position with it, and it's something that the public sector really needs.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver of Baird. Your line is open.\nRob Oliver: Great. Brian, one for you. I know last quarter, it seemed like a couple of big deals that slipped out of the quarter and the deal sizing, I think, a bit more moderate. And just curious if you saw some of those deals closed this quarter and what you're seeing in terms of deal sizing. And then just a quick follow-up. So just on the free cash flow, just to understand that better. Is that is the impact there all of the catch-up from '22? Or is there anything else on the tax side that's impacting free cash flow? I apologize laryngitis here.\nBrian Miller: Yes. On the free cash flow, yes, that impact is really pretty much all from the catch-up of Section 174, and it's a complicated calculation that's still evolving the overhead you have to add into it and some of those things. But the impact is higher than we initially expected, particularly related to the 2022 amount. Yes, the average deal size this quarter was a bit bigger than the average deal size in the first quarter of last year. A couple of those -- half of those deals that we referred to. And we always have deals that slipped from quarter-to-quarter with the subscription model, it's less impactful. But we did have a couple of license deals that we talked about in Q4 that we referred to, not by name that did close this quarter.  We had 2 really nice license deals with the -- for our property or recording product with 2 large counties in North Carolina, Wake County and which is Raleigh and Mecklenburg County, which is Charlotte. And then we had a nice public safety deal with the Virginia State Police that closed this quarter as well. So generally, we've seen those deals that the timing shifted a bit. We've seen those come in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGabriela Borges: Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on some of the commentary on margin expansion. So Lynn and Brian, as you think about the longer-term trajectory for margins, I know you've given us some qualitative color and a little bit of quantitative color as well. Is your expectation that margin progression after this year is likely to be linear? Or do you see a period of time when maybe there's an accelerated structure for margins?\nLynn Moore: Yes, Gabriela, I don't expect it will be linear. And certainly, margins and our targets and broadly how we view the trajectory of 1 of the topics we'll be looking to address at the Investor Day, that things are rarely linear. I do think around the timing of flips over the next few years as we accelerate the move of our clients from on-prem to the cloud, the timing of -- if that's a J-curve or an S curve or how that works will be a factor in that margin trajectory. I think that we're more certain around the timing of the closing of our data centers and we've talked about that in 2024 and towards the end of 2025, closing those 2 data centers and being able to reduce those bubble costs and so those will have more of an impact in those years. So I don't expect it to be linear. I really can't give much color beyond that right now, but it is something we'll continue to refine our outlook for and we'll be talking about margins will certainly be a significant topic at Investor Day.\nBrian Miller: Yes. And of course, as we grow out through Tyler 2030 and we talk about our growth in our SaaS and our flips but at the same time, we're actively growing our transaction business and our payments business, which will have somewhat of a negative effect. So depending on the growth rates between those two businesses will have some impact on overall margins?\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum of Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Housum: Good morning, guys. Brian, I know quarters pass, you talked about the servicing revenue and the staffing up with that unit. Can you perhaps talk about the staffing really you're currently at, you\u2019re? And if you have those people now, they're actually able to contribute to the bottom line?\nBrian Miller: Yes. I think we've continued to hire new staff as well as are seeing attrition flow, which is not surprising, given some of the shifts in the broader employment markets. So as we've talked about over the last few quarters, we've added new people, new classes on the pro services side and those people are becoming billable. I think you'll see in Q2 and beyond, you'll see more of the impact of that, so we will likely see nice growth in services revenue, which will also help lead most importantly, bringing subscription revenues or SaaS revenues online at a faster pace. So I think you'll start to see that really the impact of those people becoming fully billable in Q2. And I think we're pretty well on plan with our efforts to step up to the capacity we want to have.\nLynn Moore: Yes. And I think to be clear, we've talked historically over the years about services and our margins on services. And services historically is not accretive to margins. We've talked in the past about it maybe in breakeven or really more of a loss leader. That's likely not to change going forward. I think when I talked earlier about intentionality around other things that we're doing within the business, part of that is things around what we can do to minimize the negative impact of services on overall margins.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nClarke Jeffries: Brian, I just wanted to ask, was there a restatement of SaaS revenue in 2022? As I just look to Q4 as an example, it seems like we were talking about $110 million last quarter, and now it's $120 million in the supplementals. Was there any change here?\nBrian Miller: There's not a -- there was a very small reclass, I think, of some revenues from transaction revenues to SaaS revenues. So getting those kind of in line with our current reporting, but not a significant one, but -- and that's reflected in the supplemental data.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Goodwin of JMP. Your line is open.\nJoe Goodwin: I guess, Lynn and Brian, how different at the product or technology level would you say the current payment portfolio is so NIC, Rapid, everything you have there now that is built for governments versus other players in the space? And would you say you differentiate beyond your existing relationships and market presence? Or is there some differentiation on the technology level as well?\nBrian Miller: Yes. We believe the technology is meaningfully differentiated from the more horizontal payment providers. So the -- whether it's the different types of payment channels we can offer now really robust disbursement capabilities adding to the payment acquiring side and then really around the reporting, the integration to Tyler's back-end systems that makes reconciliations easier that makes the client's job easier, and it's a meaningful differentiator for us. And in fact, it enables us, in many instances, to be -- to have really solid pricing and in some cases, premium pricing because we provide additional value around that. So Rapid was a nice addition to those capabilities, but NIC already had very, very robust capabilities and continues to invest in that payments platform and enhance those. And today, we have a lot of processes underway to further integrate that payment platform into the Tyler back-end systems to create more and more of a competitive edge because of that integration.\nLynn Moore: Yes. And Joe, I think you can expect at the Investor Day in June, for us to provide a little more color, maybe in a little more detail around some of these topics, specifically the topic around differentiation in the market and what we -- why we're different and the opportunities that we have in front of us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKirk Materne: Just a follow-up, Lynn, your comment on sort of payments and maybe, I guess, I'll drag Brian into this as well. Just on the gross revenue recognition, A, I assume you all have no real ability to pick which 1 you want to go with, meaning I assume that would be easier, but I assume grosses are required by accounting rules. And is there a certain scale that payments gets to that were the drag from a mix shift perspective becomes less, meaning probably I appreciate you calling out the 100 bps this quarter. Should we expect that to get incrementally better as it just grows in scale? So I was just kind of curious about if there's any flexibility to maybe get to that and then sort of how we should think about sort of the drag as that part of the business gets bigger? Thanks.\nBrian Miller: There's not really a lot of ability to pick and choose how it's accounted for. And the difference is really whether we assume the responsibility and the risk for paying those merchant fees and interchange fees, which can vary depending on the type of credit card, whether it's Amex or Visa, whether it's a business card or a personal card. And so in most cases, our clients prefer for us to handle that so that they know what their fee is. So we have a percentage of the transaction that we charge, let's call it, 2%, and we pay out the merchant fees and interchange fees, and those might be, say, 1.75% but they can vary around that number. And generally, we also get a per transaction charge as well. And so we do get a margin on the merchant fees, but it's a pretty slim margin and then we also get a transaction fee generally. In a net model, we would -- the customer has chosen to pay those merchant fees interchange fees directly. And we're just getting a -- generally a per transaction charge for the services that we provide. And in most cases, the client prefers for us to take that risk. But if we are paying those fees, then we have to do gross accounting.  So we think it's important, even though there is some margin on those that we sort of put it back to give you what that impact is on a net basis. So if you take those fees out, as we talked about, if you take those out of both revenues and expenses and just sort of leave what we keep, it would -- it's a 200 basis point overall operating margin impact on Tyler as a whole. So depending on how fast those grow relative to the rest of Tyler, that impact could be bigger or could be smaller. And that's one of the reasons why we would expect to continue to sort of give you those numbers so that you can see the impact of and how that might be trending over time.\nLynn Moore: Yes. And just to be clear, Kirk, the -- it is customer driven, as Brian said, in the gross model, while lower margin actually produces higher free cash flow. So it's a benefit to our free cash flow.\nOperator: And that was the last we have for today. So, I\u2019d like to hand back to Lynn Moore, for closing comments. \nLynn Moore: Thanks Kevin, and thanks everybody for joining us today. If you have any further questions please feel free contract Brian Miller, or myself. Have a great day.\nOperator: That does conclude our conference today. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian Miller",
            "content": "Thanks, Lynn. Yesterday, Tyler Technologies reported its results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2023. Total revenues for the quarter were $471.9 million, up 3.5%. Organic revenue growth, which also excludes COVID-related revenues was 7.2%. Last year's first quarter included $20.6 million of revenues from COVID-related initiatives, at our Digital Solutions division, formerly NIC, all of which ended in 2022. License revenue declined 39% as our new software contract mix continued to shift to SaaS at an accelerated pace. Professional services revenue declined 13% due to completion of COVID initiatives, but rose 4.7% organically. Subscriptions revenue increased 14.3% and organically rose 16.4%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew 24.4% to $126.6 million and transaction revenues grew 7.1% to $153.9 million. On an organic basis, which also excludes COVID-related revenues, Transaction revenues grew 13.1%. We added 145 new SaaS arrangements and converted 73 existing on-premises clients to SaaS with a total new software contract value of approximately $86 million. In Q1 of last year, we added 149 new SaaS arrangements and had 88 on-premises conversions, with the total new software contract value of approximately $76 million. Our new SaaS bookings in the first quarter added $17.1 million in new ARR. Our total ARR was approximately -- I'm sorry, $1.58 billion, up 9.1% and organically grew 11.5%. Since Q4 of last year, SaaS revenues now exceed our maintenance revenues. Operating margins in the quarter were once again pressured by the acceleration of the shift to the cloud in the new business and the related decline in license revenues. As we've previously stated, we expect operating margin to trough in 2023 and to return to a trajectory of margin expansion in 2024. As we also discussed last quarter, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins. In Q1, we paid merchant fees of approximately $42 million. If those fees were netted out of both revenues and cost of revenues, our consolidated non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter would have been approximately 200 basis points higher. Cash flow was robust this quarter with cash flow from operations of $74.7 million, up 39.5% and free cash flow of $63.6 million up 55.1%. As a reminder, cash flow for the balance of the year will be impacted by an estimated $131 million of cash tax payments resulting from the Section 174 tax changes, of which $73 million is related to 2022 taxes and $58 million is related to 2023 estimated taxes. We continue to strengthen our balance sheet as we repaid $120 million of floating rate term debt during the first quarter. We ended Q1 with total outstanding debt of $875 million and cash and investments of approximately $174.2 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 1.52 times trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. Our revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the year are unchanged. Our 2023 guidance is as follows: we expect total revenues will be between $1.935 billion and $1.970 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8%.  We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $3.65 and $3.80 and may vary significantly due to the impact of stock option activity on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $7.50 and $7.65. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $26 million including approximately $5 million of noncash amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release. I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn. Sure. Around the second part of the question, I don't think we've seen the trough yet for the full year. We think the consolidated margin for the full year will be lower this year than it was last year, and our guidance implies that. I do think -- and I don't think Q2 will be the point where you'll see year-over-year margin improvement. I think by Q4, we'd expect that we would be seeing year-over-year margin improvement at that point. But not -- I don't think we've hit the trough yet. And then in terms of the overall margin, we don't give quarterly guidance, so we didn't have a quarterly margin target out there. Our earnings and revenue guidance is basically unchanged from where we started the year. So our expectations at this point are generally consistent. The first quarter did have good performance, good growth around the subscription revenues as some of those revenues are coming online from deals we've signed in prior quarters. And the pace at which those revenues hit can affect that somewhat. I think our subscription revenues were probably a bit above the -- where the Street was. But generally, our expectation for the full year margins hasn't changed. And we don't disclose the revenues for Rapid separately, but when we acquired them, they were in the kind of $14 million, $15 million annual revenue range. And on the free cash flow and I think a little bit on the bookings growth that Lynn was just mentioning. It's interesting our overall bookings growth was on an organic basis around 7%. But our subscription bookings on an organic basis were almost 24%, very close to the same number our revenue growth was. So the real strength is in the bookings, both the SaaS and the transaction bookings. On the free cash flow, yes, the $130 million, $131 million estimated incremental cash taxes this year related to Section 174 is a bit higher than we had talked about in the fourth quarter call as we've got more information and gotten into the calculations more. That impact is a little bit higher this year. I think it's $73 million of that applies to really the deposit for last year's taxes about $58 million this year. So that impact does continue to decline each year, but we have a 2-year impact or catch up in this year, but that impact should decline year-over-year until after five years, it sort of neutral. We made -- the biggest piece of that in mid-April. I think it was around $85 million. And then I think the impact is around, I think, in the $15 million range in the -- it's roughly equal in each of the last 3 quarters. On a free cash flow basis, overall, I think our free cash flow margin, excluding the Section 174 impact is, I'd say, the ranges in the kind of 18% to 20% margin range. And including the impact of the free cash flow -- I'm sorry, more in the mid-teens range and including the impact of the Section 174 change, it's kind of high single, low double-digit free cash flow margin. So the impact is pretty meaningful this year. Yes. Appraisal is certainly a much smaller piece of our business. Appraisal Services, it's an important service that we provide often to customers that we also have sold or will sell a property tax system to. But it's now well under 2% of our revenues. And so we've consolidated that line into the professional services line. And again, the focus, as you've seen from some of the things we've talked about really is around subscriptions revenue growth, the recurring revenues. And we've given some detail breaking that out between the SaaS revenues and the transaction-based revenues, which would be things like payments, our digital solutions portal, e-filing those sorts of things. In the SaaS bookings detail, you're correct, it grew sort of mid-single digits. But the -- that's really just referring to basically new logo SaaS deals. So there's additional SaaS bookings in the upsells, pricing increases, inside sales of additional products to existing customers. So the metric we really think is important is the bookings growth number for subscriptions overall, which are the transactions and SaaS revenues, and that was 23.6% this quarter. Well, I think we'd still be in the same range for the full year. I'd say we're increasingly confident of that range, and we may be trending a little bit more to the upper end of the range at this point, although it's still early in the year. But I think that yes, maybe the ramp is -- I mean I think we were still in the ballpark. We did $1.66. Last year, we did $1.76 in the first quarter, but I think that jump up into Q2 and Q3 and Q4 would be maybe a little less pronounced, but again, we're in the -- pretty much in the same range. I'll take a stab at that. I think most of it is around the lag between the time that we sign a new deal and when revenues start to hit the income statement. So when we've talked about our SaaS bookings over recent quarters and this quarter, in particular, being very strong. But there's typically a lag, whether it's a new software deal where it might be a quarter to 2 quarters maybe a little bit longer lags from the time we signed the contract to when the client is -- the environment is set up and we're able to start recognizing revenues and really the same sort of things in many of our transaction-based revenue contracts. We signed a new deal for payments, for example, and there might be perhaps a quarter or so lag between the time those revenues start to get recognized. At the same time, we see the impact of lower licenses immediately because if those were license deals, we would have recognized all that revenue or the majority of that revenue pretty much upfront when very soon after the contract is signed. So that would be the biggest factor there. And it's the same thing with flips from on-prem to the cloud. There's -- we may sign it now, but there's a period of time where that transition takes place, so we don't get the uplift in the revenues immediately. Yes. On the free cash flow, yes, that impact is really pretty much all from the catch-up of Section 174, and it's a complicated calculation that's still evolving the overhead you have to add into it and some of those things. But the impact is higher than we initially expected, particularly related to the 2022 amount. Yes, the average deal size this quarter was a bit bigger than the average deal size in the first quarter of last year. A couple of those -- half of those deals that we referred to. And we always have deals that slipped from quarter-to-quarter with the subscription model, it's less impactful. But we did have a couple of license deals that we talked about in Q4 that we referred to, not by name that did close this quarter.  We had 2 really nice license deals with the -- for our property or recording product with 2 large counties in North Carolina, Wake County and which is Raleigh and Mecklenburg County, which is Charlotte. And then we had a nice public safety deal with the Virginia State Police that closed this quarter as well. So generally, we've seen those deals that the timing shifted a bit. We've seen those come in. Yes. And of course, as we grow out through Tyler 2030 and we talk about our growth in our SaaS and our flips but at the same time, we're actively growing our transaction business and our payments business, which will have somewhat of a negative effect. So depending on the growth rates between those two businesses will have some impact on overall margins? Yes. I think we've continued to hire new staff as well as are seeing attrition flow, which is not surprising, given some of the shifts in the broader employment markets. So as we've talked about over the last few quarters, we've added new people, new classes on the pro services side and those people are becoming billable. I think you'll see in Q2 and beyond, you'll see more of the impact of that, so we will likely see nice growth in services revenue, which will also help lead most importantly, bringing subscription revenues or SaaS revenues online at a faster pace. So I think you'll start to see that really the impact of those people becoming fully billable in Q2. And I think we're pretty well on plan with our efforts to step up to the capacity we want to have. There's not a -- there was a very small reclass, I think, of some revenues from transaction revenues to SaaS revenues. So getting those kind of in line with our current reporting, but not a significant one, but -- and that's reflected in the supplemental data. Yes. We believe the technology is meaningfully differentiated from the more horizontal payment providers. So the -- whether it's the different types of payment channels we can offer now really robust disbursement capabilities adding to the payment acquiring side and then really around the reporting, the integration to Tyler's back-end systems that makes reconciliations easier that makes the client's job easier, and it's a meaningful differentiator for us. And in fact, it enables us, in many instances, to be -- to have really solid pricing and in some cases, premium pricing because we provide additional value around that. So Rapid was a nice addition to those capabilities, but NIC already had very, very robust capabilities and continues to invest in that payments platform and enhance those. And today, we have a lot of processes underway to further integrate that payment platform into the Tyler back-end systems to create more and more of a competitive edge because of that integration. There's not really a lot of ability to pick and choose how it's accounted for. And the difference is really whether we assume the responsibility and the risk for paying those merchant fees and interchange fees, which can vary depending on the type of credit card, whether it's Amex or Visa, whether it's a business card or a personal card. And so in most cases, our clients prefer for us to handle that so that they know what their fee is. So we have a percentage of the transaction that we charge, let's call it, 2%, and we pay out the merchant fees and interchange fees, and those might be, say, 1.75% but they can vary around that number. And generally, we also get a per transaction charge as well. And so we do get a margin on the merchant fees, but it's a pretty slim margin and then we also get a transaction fee generally. In a net model, we would -- the customer has chosen to pay those merchant fees interchange fees directly. And we're just getting a -- generally a per transaction charge for the services that we provide. And in most cases, the client prefers for us to take that risk. But if we are paying those fees, then we have to do gross accounting.  So we think it's important, even though there is some margin on those that we sort of put it back to give you what that impact is on a net basis. So if you take those fees out, as we talked about, if you take those out of both revenues and expenses and just sort of leave what we keep, it would -- it's a 200 basis point overall operating margin impact on Tyler as a whole. So depending on how fast those grow relative to the rest of Tyler, that impact could be bigger or could be smaller. And that's one of the reasons why we would expect to continue to sort of give you those numbers so that you can see the impact of and how that might be trending over time."

            "content": "Thanks, Hala. We began 2023 by delivering strong first quarter results that met or exceeded our expectations for most key metrics. We continue to see broad-based demand across our product solutions, reflecting strength in the public sector market and our unique ability to support our public sector client's digital modernization needs. We're seeing a high level of request for proposal and demo activity across our software business with particularly strong activity in the ERP space. Our mix of new software business also demonstrates how our market continues to embrace the move to the cloud. Total revenue growth was 3.5% with 7.2% organic growth, which also excludes COVID-related revenues and recurring revenues comprised nearly 84% of our quarterly revenues. We're pleased with our solid revenue growth even as the shift to SaaS and our new software mix continued to accelerate, with SaaS deals comprising 87% of our Q1 new software contract value compared to 80% last year. Most importantly, SaaS revenues grew organically at 24.4%. Our sales activity this quarter reflected strong cross-selling success including opportunities driven by leveraging state relationships at our Digital Solutions division, formerly NIC, and upsells with our data and insight solutions. In addition to our current quarter wins, our pipeline of cross-sell opportunities continues to grow. We also continue to execute our growth strategy around our payments business. During the first quarter, we signed more than 120 new payment deals, and we are especially pleased with the early traction that we are gaining with our acquisition of Rapid Financial Solutions and their robust payment issuing capabilities. I'd like to highlight a couple of first quarter deals that illustrate these successes. In Indiana, we expanded the relationship between Indiana's family and social services administration and our Digital Solutions division with a contract for Tyler's Disbursement as a Service platform to improve the payment disbursement process for sending its existing child care and development fund payments to providers. The purpose of the CCDS federal program is to increase the availability, affordability and quality of childcare. Leveraging the capabilities from the Rapid acquisition, in combination with our existing state enterprise contract, we will streamline the entire disbursement process from portal setup, including registering users and collecting banking information from providers to virtual account payments across all payment types and channels. Through Rapid's robust platform, the solution will also provide reporting and reconciliation features to support complete oversight of the payment program. In addition, we signed two payments contracts to provide rapid disbursement solution for court funds, including Fort Bend County, Texas, a current user of Tyler's jury management solution and Shelby County, Tennessee, a current Tyler Enterprise courts client. The quarter's largest SaaS deal valued at approximately $18.5 million was with the province of New Brunswick in Canada for our enterprise assessment solution. New Brunswick becomes the fourth Canadian province to implement our flagship property tax solution. Now I'd like for Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our annual guidance for 2023. Thanks, Brian. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strong momentum we are building across our business. Our cloud transition initiatives are on track in this pivotal year as we make progress with our move from Tyler's data centers to AWS and managed through expected margin headwinds resulting from the accelerated pace of cloud adoption as well as cloud bubble costs. Our successes in the marketplace reflect our unparalleled competitive strength, synergistic cross-sell and upsell momentum and highly desirable cloud solutions and position us well to execute on our long-term strategic growth road map. In the next few days, we'll release our fourth annual corporate responsibility report. We hope you'll take some time to review it and learn more about the progress we've made with our ESG efforts. To close, we're extremely excited to host clients in person at Connect, our annual user conference, which will take place in San Antonio from May 7 through May 10. Registrations are an all-time high, and this will be our largest connect ever, with some 6,000 public sector clients attending.  We also look forward to our upcoming Investor Day that will be held in person on June 15 in Frisco, Texas, along with a live webcast. We look forward to highlighting our differentiated value proposition in our mid- to long-term strategic plan, growth drivers and financial targets supporting our Tyler 2030 vision. More details will be communicated soon, and we hope you'll be able to join us in person or online. With that, we'd like to open the line for Q&A. Yes, Sami, I'd add this, too. We've talked a lot over the last couple of years about the cloud transition and the impact on both revenue headwinds and margins, but there's a lot more going on within Tyler. And I'd say right now, there's a lot of intentionality going on at Tyler. It's a little bit more than just sort of sitting back and letting the cloud transition run through the financial analysis. We have a lot of internal analysis, we have a lot of initiatives going on beyond just the cloud transition, taking a look -- deep look at different parts of our business, different things that we should be doing and can be doing. And I really commend our executive team and really our entire staff for the work that's going on right now. There's a lot of work going on at Tyler for sure. But I could say that everybody is sort of aligned generally with what our long-term goals and our long-term vision is and part of that is around margin expansion. So there's just a lot of things going on, a lot of intentionality. There are some bigger pieces. There's smaller things that we're doing. But I think there's just a lot of intentionality going on. Yes, Kirk, that's a good question. We actually are hosting some special events around our state government clients, and we're going to have a lot of our key state government stakeholders there. We're going to have them introduced to a lot of our executive team. So there'll be sort of a side path going on with them, also be part of the larger forum as well. Connect is just a unique opportunity for us. We've got so many clients. It's a chance for us to sit down and talk to them, talk about our vision, but also listen to them and listen to their needs, hear what their vision is, it's a chance for us to interact. It's a great opportunity for us to help our clients with more training, more information, talk about the new offerings that we have, things that can make their jobs better and more efficient. It's a big event. It takes a lot of work. Our marketing team does -- and events team just does -- it's an amazing job. If anybody hasn't been to it, I'd recommend people go, it's really done in a first-class manner. There's a lot of work that goes into it. It's not an inexpensive event, but it's something that's very worthwhile. I think not only does Tyler and executive team get a lot out of it. I think our clients get a lot out of it. Yes, sure, Matthew. I think we're -- part of your question, I think we're still in the early innings. I'd say we're still in the early innings with everything we're doing with NIC. Probably talked a year ago about being in the first inning. We might be in the top of the second. The cross-sell opportunities continue to grow. We take a very deliberate approach around that. We've been instituted this year.  We've been doing the strategic account management meetings where we're getting the Tyler salespeople together with state GMs and really sort of doing what we call sort of a state of the state baseline where we're sort of taking a deep dive and look into what are the objectives in that particular state, what are the relationships NIC, our Digital Solutions division brings, where what's the Tyler product footprint, what's the terms of the contract vehicle, how can we easily get products into those clients' hands. When we talk about what those near-term opportunities are, we do qualify them. I mean we have a number of opportunities that we think are more longer term, but what we call more qualified leads. We're up around sort of in the 175, 180 range right now. All different types of plays that we're looking at there, probably somewhere around $50 million ARR is what we've considered a more qualified pipe. Qualified pipe to me is not something that's going to close in the next month or 2, but it's something that I think has got a pretty viable horizon on it. Yes. I think what I would say there, Josh, was that what we're seeing in terms of the sales indicators, the RFP volume, the number of demos that we're doing is really at almost all-time highs. Now that's not going to turn into business for several quarters, but it's very encouraging to see. I don't really -- I can't really put my finger on what's driving that right now other than the fact that demand remains high and our clients' budgets remain solid. Sure. I think we certainly use the flips and conversions as an opportunity to upsell. That is part of our strategic direction. We're still going at a pretty healthy pace. I think when we get to Investor Day in June, probably give us -- we'll probably hear a little more guidance on the pace of our conversions and where we think we'll be over the next 4, 5, 6, all the way up to Tyler 2030. But yes, you're exactly right. It's an opportunity for us to once again reach out and upsell other products around and then help incentivize flip to. As it relates to Rapid, this is a transaction that we're pretty excited about. It's a capability that we didn't have in-house. It's not a capability that I didn't have in house, the whole bringing in the whole issuing side of disbursements and the fact that we closed that deal at the end of November. And so we've owned this company for just a little over about 5 months now, not quite 5 months and already the synergies in working with the digital services team, formally NIC, these deals that we've already got signed, I think this early is something a little unusual for us with acquisitions. It normally takes a little bit of time. There's a lot of road map looking out on the disbursement side payments. As you know, they're primarily focused right now sort of in the justice space, but there's applicability across all of our product lines. That again is going to take years to develop, but it's pretty exciting, the early momentum we've seen. Yes. I think when we talk about what we're seeing in the market, it's a couple of things, probably. I mean we're -- it certainly reinforces the principle that the things that we're providing are essential functionality. I think it reinforces the principle that we went through some periods of time where there might have been a little pent up demand coming out of COVID and also the continued shift towards modernization and digitization of local government. We also see where we talk about the labor markets, for example, and how the labor markets are affecting different companies, but they're also affecting our clients. And as there's labor shortages and turnovers with our clients, it's also creating challenges for our clients, which is having them really point to and use technology to help bridge that gap. So there's just a lot of things going on right now. It's a good market right now. And it's -- I don't know how I'd characterize this to my expectation, but I'm pretty happy with where the market is right now. Yes, sure, Pete. I think you're right. Our focus still continues to be a reduction of debt. We're -- that's our primary focus with our use of capital. It's interesting. Our term debt now is getting closer to 30% of our overall debt. It started off more at 65%. So we're about -- we've kind of flipped that model. We still look at M&A. We still evaluate a lot of M&A opportunities. Clearly, we just did this Rapid Solutions deal last fall. If we see an opportunity like that, where we really believe in the long-term strategic value, we're going to pursue it. I think that's been our take really even when we had a lot higher net leverage profile. That being said, we've got a lot of initiatives going on at Tyler, and we've got a lot of our hands full with a lot of different things. And I could see us continuing to do acquisitions like Rapid, but in terms of a larger sort of more transformational or entering into a whole new space, that's probably not on the near-term horizon. Yes, Jonathan. I think I mean data insights is something that -- when I look out in the future of public sector, that's to me is an offering that I can see every single public sector agency needing. It's a very unique offering. We're in a unique position given our big -- our large footprint and our ability to surface data across so many different solutions, not only our own but even non-Tyler solutions. I think it's something that -- look, we made that investment now 5, 6 years ago. And I think we're starting to see more and more demand for it. What we've also seen is internally, we've actually sort of deconstructed the D&I former division within Tyler, and we now sort of have it integrated with each of our divisions so that we're aligning more product with the individual demand, so it's something that I think is a differentiator for us. I think it's always been a differentiator for us. We've seen it even in the last year or so, it's been a differentiator for NIC.  When we talk about a year ago, we were talking about the South Carolina rebid or the early renewal of the Texas payments contract. Those were done in part or primarily or a major factor was our data insights. So it's something that we're going to continue to leverage. I think we're in a unique position with it, and it's something that the public sector really needs. Yes, Gabriela, I don't expect it will be linear. And certainly, margins and our targets and broadly how we view the trajectory of 1 of the topics we'll be looking to address at the Investor Day, that things are rarely linear. I do think around the timing of flips over the next few years as we accelerate the move of our clients from on-prem to the cloud, the timing of -- if that's a J-curve or an S curve or how that works will be a factor in that margin trajectory. I think that we're more certain around the timing of the closing of our data centers and we've talked about that in 2024 and towards the end of 2025, closing those 2 data centers and being able to reduce those bubble costs and so those will have more of an impact in those years. So I don't expect it to be linear. I really can't give much color beyond that right now, but it is something we'll continue to refine our outlook for and we'll be talking about margins will certainly be a significant topic at Investor Day. Yes. And I think to be clear, we've talked historically over the years about services and our margins on services. And services historically is not accretive to margins. We've talked in the past about it maybe in breakeven or really more of a loss leader. That's likely not to change going forward. I think when I talked earlier about intentionality around other things that we're doing within the business, part of that is things around what we can do to minimize the negative impact of services on overall margins. Yes. And Joe, I think you can expect at the Investor Day in June, for us to provide a little more color, maybe in a little more detail around some of these topics, specifically the topic around differentiation in the market and what we -- why we're different and the opportunities that we have in front of us. Yes. And just to be clear, Kirk, the -- it is customer driven, as Brian said, in the gross model, while lower margin actually produces higher free cash flow. So it's a benefit to our free cash flow. Thanks Kevin, and thanks everybody for joining us today. If you have any further questions please feel free contract Brian Miller, or myself. Have a great day."

We carried our momentum from the first half of the year into the third quarter and delivered remarkably strong results. The quarter was highlighted by strong top and bottom line performance, even as we saw a more pronounced shift towards SaaS and our new software contract mix, particularly in public safety, where expected on-premise license deals shifted to SaaS contracts in the quarter resulting in license revenues that were below plan. SaaS and transaction revenues fueled our growth and both exceeded our expectations. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 25.4%, benefiting from our cloud efficiency initiatives and improved professional services margins and free cash flow reached a new quarterly high. As we've discussed in the past, our progress towards our 2025 and 2030 targets will not be linear. But our results through the first 9 months of this year bolster our confidence in achieving those top targets. We are beginning to see benefits from our cloud operations initiatives with efficiencies reflected in our results somewhat ahead of plan. Recurring revenues grew 12.1% and comprised 85% of our total revenues. Our SaaS revenues growth of 20.3% represents our 15th consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more, consistent with our target of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025. The public sector market remains robust, supported by healthy budgets and an increased focus on modernizing aging mission-critical systems through cloud adoption. The strong market activity we've discussed for the past few quarters along with excellent execution by our sales teams, is reflected in our new software bookings this quarter with our new SaaS contract value of approximately $105.6 million, up 78% over last year. Our leading market position, anchored by our deep domain expertise and large installed base forms the foundation of our long-term strategic focus on 4 key growth drivers: executing our cloud-first strategy, leveraging our unmatched installed base, expanding into new markets and growing our payments business. Our cloud-first strategy is a pivotal driver of our success and continues to shape our future in our cloud living culture. We are leading with cloud across our product portfolio as the public sector market continues to embrace digital modernization and choose Tyler's next-generation cloud solutions. Additionally, we've made substantial progress with our cloud optimization efforts, driving efficiencies and scalability, while also making solid progress on version consolidation to further accelerate on-premise client migrations and enable clients to easily expand their mission-critical applications in the cloud. The pendulum is continuing to shift to the cloud with both new and existing clients, and we are seeing a growing trend of client-driven SaaS adoption. This is especially apparent in areas that have previously lagged the rest of our market in terms of cloud adoption, most notably, the public safety market, along with the state and federal market with our application platform. Overall, SaaS arrangements comprised 97% of our new software contract value in the third quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, 100% of our public safety new contract value was SaaS compared to only 28% a year ago. It was also a great quarter for flip signings as we signed a total of 108 flips of on-premises clients. The total contract value from flips was more than triple that of last year's third quarter, and the average ARR of flips rose 37.2%. Our Courts & Justice business was very active in the third quarter. Our largest deal in the quarter was a contract with Kentucky Court of Justice for Enterprise Justice suite, including case manager, e-filing and court analytics in addition to payments. The initial 6-year term represents $35 million in total contract value, although only $10.6 million was recorded in bookings in backlog this quarter due to contract provisions. ARR starts at approximately $2.5 million and grows to $6.5 million in year 6, in addition to payments processing under a gross revenue model. Of note, the first 6 years of SaaS fees totaling $29 million was prepaid in October using ARPA funds. Other successful Tyler court clients and in particular, the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts served as strong references in this competitive sales process that span more than 12 years. Kentucky is our 17th statewide courts client and our third statewide enterprise justice solution deployed in the cloud. We also signed a 3-year $9.6 million SaaS contract for our Enterprise Justice suite with the Phoenix, Arizona Municipal Court. That agreement includes a cooperative master purchase agreement provision that enabled the Arizona Supreme Court to designate Tyler as a preferred software provider for all 170 courts in the state, including superior, justice and municipal courts, with the alternative option being the state's aging legacy system. We're excited about the opportunity to expand our partnership across Arizona courts with significant potential ARR. Other notable third quarter SaaS deals included a $12 million 5-year contract with the city of St. Petersburg, Florida, the fifth largest in the state for enterprise permitting and licensing and enterprise ERP utility billing solutions along with payments. We signed 6 SaaS contracts for our enterprise public safety solution, including 2 of the fastest-growing cities in the U.S., the City of Frisco, Texas Police Department for $750,000 in ARR and the City of Round Rock, Texas police for $730,000 in ARR. Central to our growth is leveraging our unmatched installed base and expanding our addressable market through strategic cross-sell and upsell activity that unlocks significant expansion opportunities with both new and existing clients. A key cross-sell win this quarter was a multiyear strategic contract with the Texas Office of Court Administration for our Texas Connected Justice Data Cloud. This includes alliance exchange, enterprise data platform, open data platform and our Digital Solutions division's engagement builder platform. This integrated solution captures real-time online data across every jurisdiction in the state. This multiyear engagement exemplifies our connected communities vision by creating a digital infrastructure for data sharing and decision-useful business intelligence and reporting. The contract adds $1.5 million in ARR and is the first of its kind in a large population state, paving the way for additional add-on opportunities. Another significant cross-sell win was a contract for the modernization of 18 different boards with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation for our state regulatory application platform suite which also brings in augmented field operations, formerly ARInspect. The 3-year contract leveraged our Illinois state enterprise agreement and represents $9.2 million in total contract value, with a 7-year option that adds $12.5 million in total contract value. We're pleased to see an increasing number of our clients modernizing their enterprise solutions using our application platform. Driving payments adoption of our differentiated payments business is another key element in our growth strategy. In the third quarter, we signed 268 new payment deals across Tyler software clients, representing approximately $8.6 million in projected ARR. Riverside County, an existing property and recording software client is our first enterprise payments win in California. This collaborative effort expanded from initial property and recording payments contracts to processing payments for more than 10 agencies across the county, which is the fourth most populated county in California. In our enterprise portal business, we secured extensions for our digital government and payment processing services in 5 states, which includes winning competitive rebids for state enterprise portals in New Jersey and Indiana. We also expanded our scope with the state of Indiana to include resident engagement identity proofing for approximately $1 million in additional ARR. This builds on Tyler's chatbot front-end technology recently deployed representing the first AI project for Indiana and its residents. This solution was provided through a joint effort with our AI task force and our Indian state enterprise team in collaboration with the Indiana Office of Technology. Now I'd like Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our updated annual guidance for 2024.\nBrian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Total revenues for the quarter were $543.3 million, up 9.8% and organically grew 9.4%. Subscriptions revenue increased 17.6% and organically rose 17.3%. Within subscription, SaaS revenues grew 20.3% to $166.6 million and grew organically 19.7% against a tough comparison with last year's third quarter. Keep in mind that there's often a lag from the signing of a new SaaS dealer flip to the start of revenue recognition, they can vary from one to several quarters. Because of this, as well as the timing of SaaS renewals and related price increases, SaaS revenue growth both year-over-year and sequentially may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Transaction revenues grew 15.2% to $180.5 million, driven by higher transaction volumes from both new and existing clients, including the August go-live of the California Department of Parks and Recreation. SaaS deals comprised approximately 97% of our Q3 new software contract value compared to 80% last year. During the quarter, we added 181 new SaaS arrangements and converted 108 existing on-premises clients to SaaS, with a total contract value of approximately $141 million. In Q3 of last year, we added 161 new SaaS arrangements and had 79 flips with a total contract value of approximately $71 million. The average ARR from new SaaS contracts increased 38% over last year. The average ARR associated with our Q3 flips increased 37% over last year as larger clients such as Cobb County, Georgia and Providence, Rhode Island flips to the cloud. Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.85 billion, up 12.1% and organically grew 11.8%. We entered 2024 expecting operating margin expansion after experiencing the margin trough from our cloud transition in 2023. Our non-GAAP operating margin in the third quarter was 25.4% up 60 basis points from last year. The margin expansion reflects the impact of our cloud efficiency initiatives, along with effective operating expense management and improved professional services margins. As we discussed on previous calls, merchant and interchange fees from our payment business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins as they are passed through to clients and are included in both revenues and cost of revenues. We incurred merchant fees of approximately $42 million in Q3 compared to $36 million last year. Because of strong earnings and effective working capital management, both cash flows, operations and free cash flow reached new quarterly highs at $263.7 million and $252.9 million, respectively, with free cash flow up 55.5%. Cash flow in the quarter was positively impacted by the deferral to the fourth quarter of approximately $14 million of federal tax payments. We ended the quarter with $600 million of convertible debt outstanding and cash and investments of approximately $548 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 0.1 times trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. In September, we replaced our existing $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a new facility that matures in 2029, increasing the size to $700 million in improving terms. This new revolver further improves our available liquidity and provide us with maximum flexibility to address potential financing needs. Our updated 2024 annual guidance is as follows: we expect total revenues will be between $2.125 billion and $2.145 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 9%. We expect that merchant fees will be up approximately 7% over last year and that implied organic growth, excluding merchant fees would be approximately 20 basis points higher. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $6.13 and $6.28 and may vary significantly due to the impact of discrete tax items on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $9.47 and $9.62. We expect our free cash flow margin will be between 21% and 23%, including an estimated impact of approximately $54 million of incremental cash taxes related to Section 174. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q3 earnings deck posted on our website. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. As we close out another strong quarter, I want to highlight the consistently high level of execution and collaboration across our teams, which is even more critical to our ongoing success as we leverage a fully enabled cloud infrastructure to deliver continuous innovation and enhanced client experience. The strength of our One Tyler team is rooted in a shared commitment to excellence and to our mission, vision and values, which drives our ability to execute at high levels. During the quarter, we were recognized by Newsweek as one of America's greenest companies, placing us among the top 500 greenest companies in the United States based on environmental sustainability. We were also named the Newsweek's America's greatest workplaces for parents and families 2024 list. We're gratified by this recognition of our commitment to fostering a strong inclusive culture with a healthy work-life balance and high-quality benefits. Now we'd like to open up the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nKen Wong: Lots of momentum this quarter on the cloud side. I wanted to maybe dive into that 3 times on the TCV of flips up to $36 million. Lynn or Brian, do you think this is a new run rate? Or is this just more of a one-off quarterly dynamic here?\nBrian Miller: As we said, these can be a little bit lumpy. This was a strong quarter with some larger flips, but that's a trend that we're seeing, more of our larger customers that have been slower to flip to the cloud, more complicated projects are now starting to move at a faster pace and the progress we've made with version consolidation over the last couple of years has also helped get us in a position to facilitate that as more of those customers are now on current versions of software and have gone through that upgrade process to put them in a position to move to the cloud. So I think as we've said in the past, we should expect to continue to see growth in the flip volume and the size of flips and we sort of envision a bell curve-shaped trend of those over the next 3 or 4 years, and we're still kind of moving up the left-hand side of that bell curve. But it could be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. But generally, we expect to continue to see the flips growth to achieve the targets we set out for 2030 of 80% to 85% of our on-prem base having moved to the cloud by then.\nLynn Moore: Yes. Just to amplify, Ken, Brian is right. It will tend to be lumpy. I don't think I would model this as our new run rate, which was your question. But we do expect to see this continued momentum.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt VanVliet from BTIG. Your line is open.\nMatt VanVliet: I'd be curious in terms of what you saw of sales linearity throughout the third quarter and maybe into October? And are you seeing at least lately any pressure of maybe decisions not being made until after the election? Or any impact there? But maybe just overall, what you're seeing in terms of demand linearity?\nLynn Moore: Yes. That's a good question. We're actually not seeing any slowdowns or hesitations due to the election. Generally speaking, when you look across all the business units at Tyler and particularly at our flagship products, most of our divisions are either at or exceeding their sales plans for the year. And so that's been good. The things that we've been talking in the past couple of quarters have continued. And so we're not seeing any slowdown at this point or any pauses due to any macro factors or the election.\nBrian Miller: And really not any changes in linearity, we tend not to be super back-end loaded within quarters, and I don't think we've seen any change in that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line from Alexei Gogolev from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nAlexei Gogolev: Lynn, I had a question about the incremental competition during the quarter. Are you seeing more pressure from players like ServiceNow and intelligence and analytics, in Workday in ERP? Or have those competitors subsided as demand in their core markets begins to recover?\nLynn Moore: I think generally stepping back, the competitive landscape is has been pretty neutral throughout the year. I wouldn't say there's been any significant increased competition or any decreased competition. As you know, all of our -- I think when you look at our -- the subverticals like ERP, we certainly see more competition from players that are more horizontal players like Workday, we see them -- I don't know that we see them a significant amount more than we have in the past. When you talk about ServiceNow and our -- against our platform solution, we see them in that space, but we're kind of a different offering. And a lot of the things that were -- the application platform plays best is are areas where ServiceNow is really probably a little bit bigger and heavier. So overall, I think the competitive landscape is generally the same. I think our -- when I look at win rates, they've generally been consistent and were consistent in Q3 with what we've been experiencing over the past several quarters and probably a couple of years.\nAlexei Gogolev: And Brian, a quick question on 2025 guidance that you've provided last year. Directionally, would you be able to suggest that you think you could see top line growth acceleration next year versus this year. And how are you thinking about free cash flow margin that you provided considering the net working capital improvements that you've just reported?\nBrian Miller: Sure. Well, we're obviously not ready to give our '25 guidance yet and we're in our planning process and kind of in the early stages of that. I think what we've talked about is that we're probably a little bit ahead of where we targeted 2025 along the path to our 2030 targets. But we said it's not linear. And being a little bit ahead doesn't necessarily mean where we finish up '25 or 2030 will be significantly ahead of those initial targets. So we're confident around those. I think specifically on the cash flow side, we're certainly well ahead of that. We're above where we targeted 2025 already. There are some things that have been affected this year that are a little bit more onetime. But I think generally, this would be a level we'd look to build off of for 2025. So I do expect that '25, our cash flow will be at least kind of consistent with where we are this year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nMichael Turrin: On the transaction business, ARR there are meaningful, we're used to seeing that may be down sequentially in 3Q, and it was up this year. I know you had a comment on a go live, but anything else you'd point us towards and drivers of the transaction revenue base? And is the seasonality there at all changing?\nBrian Miller: I don't think there's really a change in the seasonality. And typically, the last half of the year is slower in terms of volumes. But that's been offset really by a couple of things. One is the revenues from new payments clients that we've added over the course of the last year, we've been disclosing those numbers. And consistently close to a couple of hundred this quarter, significantly above that in terms of the number of new payments customers that we're adding within our software client base. And we're also having better experience in getting those clients live faster and getting those revenues flowing faster from the time we sign them to the time that they're onboarded, and that's having a positive impact. And then within the transactions business in general, what we alluded to in terms of some new customers to the California State Parks contract that we signed late last year went live this quarter. That added about $3 million of revenue, although it wasn't a full quarter impact. Various things like in Florida with our payments contract the Florida turnpikes with SunPass went live during the quarter, and that added a couple of million dollars of new revenues. So it's really a combination of new business as well as increased volume. So we're seeing greater adoption through our client base, and we're working with our clients to help them get more of their citizens doing things online and running through our systems.\nLynn Moore: Yes. And to amplify that a little, Michael, I mean Brian is right. We are starting to experience -- we're learning better. The onboarding efficiencies is bringing revenue recognition faster, which is great. The California State go live, I want to emphasize that for a minute because that's a big deal. I mean, we signed this contract late last year in less than 3 quarters, we were up and live. And remember, this is the largest contract in Tyler's history. And we've talked about this sometimes on the call, and it gets lost sometimes in the numbers. But really, the secret sauce of Tyler is execution. And it's our sales execution. It's our implementation execution, it's our support, it's management. And it just -- it takes a lot to do what we do. And we signed over 200 new deals, 100 flips a quarter. That's a lot of business that's going on, and it's the work of our teams and the execution is what provides that referenceability that keeps the engine running. And to get a big go-live in California to go basically on time and on budget is really a great accomplishment for our teams and sets us up not only well to execute on that contract. But then to -- for others to look at that success and duplicate that in other jurisdictions.\nMichael Turrin: Just a small follow-on clarification, if I may, on the prior question. I think the primary question we're getting is just on the free cash flow performance. So Brian, just in summarizing some of what you said previously, it sounds like, is there anything you could do to help quantify anything that would fall into the more onetime basket. And it sounds like while you're not updating 2025 targets here, there's no reason to expect margin to go down next year relative to what you're delivering. You're just kind of working through plans. Is that the right takeaway for us at this point?\nBrian Miller: Yes, I think so. We're kind of at a little bit higher level than we had initially planned. I don't know that we would grow in terms of a margin significantly from where we are right now. But again, that's ahead of where we plan to be. The biggest onetime thing, which really will be reflected in the fourth quarter that's reflected in our full year guidance is what Lynn mentioned around the Kentucky courts contract where they are prepaying or prepaid in October, 6 years of SaaS payments. So there's a $29 million bump. That's not a typical situation that we see we're happy to accept that payment, but it's not typical. So that's the biggest onetime thing we're seeing that pull forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman from Truist. Your line is open.\nTerry Tillman: It's great to hear the call out from my home state, Kentucky, multiple times. I have one question. It's a multiparter though. I think, Lynn, you've talked in your prepared remarks and it's in the press release around cross-selling success. What I'm curious is have you done things go-to-market kind of organized to kind of drive more of that pattern recognition? And what are some common plays you see for kind of the cross-selling? Like what product in particular seems to stand out? And then the second part of this question is the reality there's another milestone here for cross-selling success once you get these flips kind of stood up. And so maybe we could see a step-up even in more cross-selling once they're kind of stable on new kind of cloud technology.\nLynn Moore: Yes. Good questions, Terry. I'll start with the second one. The answer to that is yes. I think part of the part of the equation of doing flips is it brings actually the uptake, we call it more upselling. But yes, that is part of that equation. And I do think it's something. It's another opportunity for us to be in front of the client. Another opportunity to add additional products as they're making another decision. On cross-selling, there's a lot of things that go into that. And I would say things that we have done internally over the last year, 12, 18 months have played a significant role in that. I've talked -- I think I've talked about that on some prior calls, things that we've done around how we comp our sales people, how we comp the different divisions what that basis is. And we've moved to a more of a One Tyler compensation level so that basically, if there are multiple divisions that are contributing to a sales process, we don't have to fight over who's getting the credit because the credit, it shouldn't really matter, if's Tyler wins. And so we've done things internally that I think have broken down internal barriers that have just sort of, I think, grease the wheels a little bit more. In terms of product suites, it's funny, yes, some tend to go a little bit more than others. Sometimes you may get some Courts & Justice products that tie well to our Public Safety products. Sometimes, for example, we did a significant deal this quarter in Kenosha, Wisconsin. That was our ERP full suite. It would also include enterprise, appraisal and tax including our municipal justice. Big integrated story, Gartner-led procurement about $1.6 million in ARR. So while there are products that sort of sometimes naturally seem to go together, our integrated story and the Tyler story tends to also sometimes bring products together in deals that you might not necessarily think on the face of it that, that would have been an inclusive sale, but we're seeing that. We also saw that in St. Petersburg, Florida. I think I mentioned that in my prepared remarks. That was enterprise permanent license, but it also brought in our utility billing and payments. That was almost a $2 million ARR deal. So we're seeing progress and a lot of it is the result of some internal initiatives, and it's just the more success we're having in the market and selling that sort of integrated story of Tyler is resonating.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Reilly from Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nJoshua Reilly: So after being at the IACP event here, one of the topics that came up was where customers are at in terms of version consolidation. Just wanted to get an update on some of the key product areas where we are at with that. I believe Public Safety is at around 30%, which might get a bit behind some of the other larger products? And how do you think about the benefit to margins over the next several quarters as you get more up-to-date there?\nLynn Moore: No, good question, Josh. I think I talked about on the last call, version consolidation is a big piece of what we call Phase 1 of our cloud transition. And each of our flagship products have been going at different paces because they have different starting points. I would say, generally speaking, sitting here in the fall of 2024, I'm pleased with where we are at version consolidation. I think we're ahead of where I thought we would have been looking back 2 or 3 years ago. And some of our products, this is a heavier lift. But if you look, for example, at our Courts & Justice, our Enterprise Justice solution, you look at our enterprise ERP solution, we have an overwhelming number of clients now that are down to 1 or 2 versions, far removed from the days of having 5, 6, 7 versions out in the field. I think that's part of what you're seeing with our outperformance this year. We talked about our margin outperformance being driven in part by some of our cloud efficiencies. Those cloud efficiencies are -- our products are getting more optimized to be run in AWS. But we're also seeing the benefits of that version consolidation. It takes a lot less people to maintain and support fixed bugs on a single version or even 2 versions than 6 or 7 versions. And that's part of what we're looking at when we start talking about Phase 2 of our cloud strategy, which is what we call cloud living. It's getting all of our clients onto that single version, getting them on really short release cycles, less disruptive, large versions out in the field, higher client set. So I think we're making really good progress there. I do expect that to continue to help gross margins as we look towards our Tyler 2030 goals, that's where some of that gross margin improvement is going to come. And again, I'm pleased with where we're at right now on version consolidation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGabriela Borges: Lynn and Brian, I wanted to ask, given your experience in the space, we're clearly in a really healthy part of the budgeting cycle and the willingness to spend cycle across state and local governments. How should we be thinking about the sustainability of some of the healthy demand that you're seeing. And maybe just level set us on the ARPA funds, how much of a benefit do you think that you're seeing today versus how much could you see in 2025 and 2026 as the funds that are committed to actually get spent?\nLynn Moore: Yes, Gabriela, I think overall, I mean, budgets have been at a pretty good level for, I'd say, a couple of years now. And I can't predict what's going to happen 3 or 5 years from now. I can't even predict what's going to happen in 2 weeks with the election. But I think our outlook right now and what we're seeing in leading sales indicators is we see that continue -- that level staying for the foreseeable future, our RFP counts, our demo counts, all those leading sales indicators are strong and are consistent with prior quarters and really the last couple of years. And so those are really the data points that I look at most. I'm sorry, I forgot the second question.\nBrian Miller: ARPA funds.\nLynn Moore: ARPA funds have been an interesting topic over the last several years. There are certain deals that were clearly driven by ARPA funds. We talked about the Kentucky Enterprise Justice deal where they prepaid that all up front. We also had a significant deal, the Arizona Supreme Court deal that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, was also funded by ARPA funds. We don't always know and we haven't always known when ARPA is the trigger and what we've said over the past, sometimes, it's not the direct trigger, but it may have freed up other opportunities. There's been a hesitancy sometimes in our business to use ARPA funds given the recurring nature, they sometimes tend to have been used more on onetime things. We saw that sort of in our student transportation business, maybe for a large purchase of hardware, something like that. I think they've been helpful over the last few years. I don't think that's been a major tailwind to growth in sales. That's not what we're hearing from our sales folks.\nBrian Miller: But those do -- until the end of '26 to send those dollars. So some of those things that ARPA funds will be used for may not even have started. They may have been committed but internally, but haven't even started the buying process. And just, for example, like with the Kentucky deal, even though they're using ARPA funds to pay 6 years of SaaS, that was a 12-year sales process from the time we started talking to them. So the deal didn't materialize because of ARPA funds, but it affected -- so we wouldn't say that, that deal just happened because of ARPA and wouldn't have happened without it, but it certainly benefited the timing of it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Lynn, maybe for you, just to hit on a little bit of a different topic. Tyler's services has always been really important for your government customers. But it's been interesting to see that business over time grow just a little bit slower than the rest of the software business. So maybe the question is, could you maybe speak to how the services intensity in the business is changing as Tyler becomes more of a SaaS company, and maybe relatedly, Brian, for you, maybe touch on how that impacts margins over time.\nLynn Moore: Yes, that's a good question. And actually, I'll start a little bit, too, with what you asked Brian, is part of our outperformance this year has been our services gross margins. And that has been something that we have focused on at a management level over the last couple of years, and you're starting to see some of that. So a good management focus and attention. It's also been a function of the labor market. So the labor markets have really stabilized. We're seeing a lot less turnover and high turnover in our services areas creates a lot of inefficiencies. It takes a long time for people to get onboarded, up to speed and out and billable. But we've had some other internal initiatives that really help drive those professional services. As we look out over the next several years, I would expect our services to remain relatively flat. In fact, next year, they may actually decrease a little bit. That's a function of a couple of things. I think it is a function of efficiencies and how we can onboard clients. We've done some internal initiatives around that which also a function of in our -- some of our really large implementations, like in Courts & Justice and a lot of customization work. We're moving away from that. We don't have as many of those on the horizon and the whole concept of clients having one-off custom applications is something that we are moving. It's part of our cloud living goals as move forward. So it's a number of factors there. It is something that's been a focus of it. But you're right, it has been declining as a percentage of revenues. And as I look out, I would expect it to stay flat to decline as compared to other growth in our revenue lines.\nBrian Miller: Yes. So just as Lynn said, less services in the mix. Services are lowest margin, and in fact, historically, have had a negative margin. So the combination of less services in the mix from all those factors that Lynn mentioned, combined with improving margins on the services we are doing should continue to have a positive impact on our margins. And we pointed that out as one of the not the biggest, but one of the factors in driving towards our 2030 margin targets.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Charlie Strauzer from CJS Securities. Your line is open.\nCharlie Strauzer: Lynn and Brian, when you talk to clients who are somewhat hesitant to flip, what are some of the reasons why they're so cautious? And ultimately, how do you convince them otherwise?\nLynn Moore: I think some of the reasons are just some of the historic reasons, control. You've got people maybe who are not -- have been there a long time. They're used to having control of their systems, control of everything. I think what happens is, we've talked about aging technology, but also aging infrastructure starts to lead to more and more openness to flips. I think you also see the increase in cyber attacks, creating a different sort of demand and new demand for flips. But I think also we talk a lot about how everything we do is public. Every implementation we do all -- every county, every city looks at their neighbors, looks across jurisdictions to see what's going on. And whatever hesitancy that people may have felt 5 years ago, 7 years ago, as they see their neighboring jurisdictions make those decisions and the success that they're having, and I'll go back to my comment earlier about our success in executing and they see us being able to get them up and live and running in a better environment. I think that starts to break down those barriers as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird. Your line is open.\nRob Oliver: Lynn, I just wanted to go back quickly to the question earlier regarding the ARPA funds. Given the fact that we have a deadline now to obligate these funds, I know you guys have been hesitant to draw a direct line between them and the actual deals. And you alluded to the Kentucky win, which is obviously exciting in Courts & Justice, but you noted that it was over a decade in the hopper. What, if anything, is your sales force doing now at state and local to be in front of your customers to talk about that commit process, how Tyler products could be useful. I know the vendor decision doesn't need to be made necessarily by the end of December. But I just -- I guess, another way of asking the previous question from Gabriela in terms of confidence that we might see more deals that could be supportive of that '25 and '26 progress, the deadline by which they need to spend it.\nLynn Moore: Yes, Rob, I don't know that we're doing anything different than we've done in the last couple of years. All of our sales teams have been armed with information on ARPA funds. They're armed with the right marketing materials. They generally know what's around. They've got their talking points. But I'll reiterate, I don't think -- I can't draw a direct correlation over the last few years of ARPA funds to Tyler's performance in a material way. It has definitely been part of the overall environment. But again, as I said, as I look at indicators going out into the future, the things that we track that sort of help us track demand and budgets. Those are remaining pretty consistent right now. So I'm not suggesting that ARPA hasn't been helpful. I just -- I have not been able to really draw a material one-on-one direct correlation to that other than, obviously, some deals, but the Kentucky deal. I think the interesting thing about that is it sometimes -- it highlights really sometimes the long nature of these sales processes and the tenacity of us and the long-term nature of everything we do in our long-term vision and staying power there was 12 years later, and we benefited from cash flow with ARPA funds, but we were going to get that deal whether ARPA funds were available or not.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is open.\nJonathan Ho: Can you give us a little bit of sense around the AI opportunity? I think you referenced one large deal and how your customers are maybe thinking about leveraging AI over time and what that means from an upsell perspective?\nLynn Moore: Yes. Jonathan, it's -- we're starting to see a little bit of questions in RFPs around AI and what AI technology we're using, how we're leveraging it. I don't think anything right now has changed from what we've said over the last couple of quarters. We're focusing our efforts on sort of right now, trying to decide where exactly we want to put most of our resources behind AI internal versus external facing solutions. I still continue to believe that there's a lot of applicability pointing inward in things that we can do on repetitive type activity that some of our employees do. But we have seen an uptick. I mean we made the acquisition of CSI last year. AI is a deeply embedded part of that solution is having a lot of success in the market. ARInspect has some AI tools, and I mentioned the ARInspect deal on the portion of the Illinois deal that I talked about earlier. So we're doing things around AI. Customers are starting to be more open about talking about it. I think a year ago, clients were probably really hesitant. It's not a driver right now in deals, but they're curiosity and their interest is starting to surface. And my guess is we'll hear more about it when we get together connect next year and probably even more about it the following year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKeith Housum: In terms of like the acquisition front, you've got favorable debt terms, you're generating a good amount of cash. How are you guys thinking about acquisitions now? And then in terms of more specifically, is there specific end markets within your business that you're thinking that could benefit from acquisitions more than others? And perhaps what would they be?\nLynn Moore: Yes, Keith, we're viewing it similarly. I mean, I've talked about the last couple of years, our priority is debt pay down. Our cash balances are approaching what our convertibles do in about 16, 17 months. And so we're looking. We always look. We've been looking, I look at deals every quarter. we're probably a little pickier right now than we might otherwise be. But I do think as we go into 2025 and then into 2026, we're not going to change our standards. We're not going to change our valuation approach. But I do think you'll see us -- I'll probably evaluate more and maybe a deal that we might have said, \u201cHey, maybe we don't do it right now, that might tip in that direction\u201d. We don't have anything specific right now in the hopper. We do talk internally about really what's the best area for us to go get our bang for a buck. And should we sort of start being a little more proactive as opposed to reactive. Those are discussions we're having internally. But generally, as it relates to capital, our stance is kind of the same right now, but I can see that evolving over the next 12, 18 months.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel from Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nMark Schappel: John, a question for you. Building on the earlier question on version consolidation which has been somewhat of a gating item to get customers to migrate to the cloud. Could you just discuss some of the characteristics that you're using to encourage customers to move to the latest product release?\nJohn Marr: Well, there's a combination of things. And each of our products are in different stages of using those combination of things. Some of them have been maybe some minor financial considerations. Some of them have been only new feature will be available in the cloud, some of it will be -- we're no longer going to support a version of the cloud. We haven't drawn a lot of those hard sticks yet, particularly with our flagships. But it's a variety of things that's going on. I think clients also are starting to realize the benefit and the need to get upgraded. Part of the -- what happened is when particularly when clients have multiple products of ours and those products are on multiple different years of versions. It's really hard for the products to talk. And I think you also see it with support calls. You've got clients who might have been on a version that's 4 or 5 years old and they're having issues, but what they didn't realize is that those issues were corrected in a version 3 years ago, they just didn't take the upgrade. So it's sales pitch. it's things we're doing internally. It's a variety of things. It's not one thing. And each one is in a different stage. As I talked before, we're doing multiple cloud transitions, which means we're doing multiple version consolidations at the same time.\nBrian Miller: But with respect to version consolidation specifically, I guess, you call it a stick is that we actually are sunsetting older versions and giving clients certainly ample notice. But letting clients know the version they're on, the oldest versions will no longer be supported after a certain date and working with them to move them to the current version for that date. And we've done that with multiple products. We've sunset multiple old versions of our enterprise ERP solution, our Enterprise Justice solution and have made significant progress in moving those customers to current versions as we discontinue support of the older versions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nClarke Jeffries: A question for Brian on the sort of the pace of the SaaS revenue I know you had quoted that the volatility of SaaS revenue, the timing of the go-lives from booked to a live system can be variable. But I just wanted to ask, we have 2 years now where the sequential growth in Q3 is the highest. I wanted to understand if that's purely circumstantial if there's any emerging seasonality to those go live. Any prerogative of these governments to get live on a Q3 or is that just really reflective of typically high Q4 bookings activity?\nBrian Miller: Yes. It's probably more the latter. I don't think there's a certain characteristic or something that's causing that. It's probably around the timing, especially bigger customers, and it varies by market. For example, in the schools market, which is smaller for us, but they typically have a big push more in Q2 because they want to have new systems live before a new school year starts. Fiscal years don't really have as much to do with it. So I think it's more circumstantial.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nAlex Zukin: Congrats on another solid quarter. I'll ask maybe a longer-term question. I think it's been alluded to a little bit. But again, as we think about AI, both agentic, copilot or system and you think about the customers that are starting to ask those questions. You think about the breadth of solutions that you're offering, both to your customers and across the portfolio of products. As we think about that monetization pathway, is that something we should think about maybe on top of the long-term guidance that you provided at the last Analyst Day through 2030, or is that embedded in there? I ask because it seems like the pace of the innovation wave has moved so fast since you guys fully were even able to contemplate that. So how do we think about those, the top line growth characteristics that could be associated there? And any incremental potential margin degradation or headwinds or thoughts about that? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nLynn Moore: Yes, sure, Alex. The short answer is, yes, when we gave our 2030 targets, we did not bake in efficiencies, internal efficiencies on any gross margin lines that were going to be driven by AI nor did we really bake in any sales that were really a result of either new products, products, newly developed products or newly acquired products. To the extent, AI was already in some of our products, we already had sort of some long-term sales road maps. So perhaps a little bit, but not in terms of additional R&D, additional M&A. And so that's the way I would think about it. I'd just remember that we're taking a very deliberative approach to AI. And while I say that we're hearing more and more customers start to have things in their RFPs around AI. It's not a majority yet. And I think our clients will still be a little bit conservative. But when you start looking out 5, 7 years, those opportunities are there, and we're not going to wait 5 to 7 years to then spin up initiatives. We will be doing those along the way. And to the extent there was some major R&D initiative, which hypothetically because that's not right now on our road map and it adjusted our -- an R&D expense line or something we would obviously signal that and tell you that. But in terms of our long-term targets, no, no significant AI benefits, either margin or revenue were baked in.\nAlex Zukin: And to what extent, maybe this is just a clarification. To what extent are you hearing or seeing in sales cycles that those types of questions are actually facilitating or we're amplifying flips or converts either the timeline around them or the momentum or enthusiasm. And then on free cash flow, Brian, again, I think the outperformance obviously both in the quarter and the guide for the full year, very notable. You noted that one Kentucky prepayment contract. How do we think about like when, where and like why those prepayments happen. And more so, as we look to '25 and beyond, is there any reason to assume that those would happen more frequently or less frequently and kind of changing the complexion of the free cash flow margins.\nBrian Miller: Yes. The prepayment was really kind of a one-off thing where at least relative to that size of that were -- and that actually will show up in the fourth quarter cash flow. But that was, again, ARPA funds being used to prepay 6 years of SaaS payments. I don't think that would be the norm. The thing that I think more consistent with an impact on free cash flow is the characteristics around the transaction business. That transaction revenues, whether they're payments or e-filing and those sorts of things. We generally get paid at the time of the transaction or very quickly after it. So we're not carrying large receivables there. So the cash flow characteristics of that transaction business are very attractive. And so as it continues to grow even at a tick higher than the rest of our business, that has a positive impact on cash flow. We've also had really effective management around our receivables and have brought down our DSOs and continue to manage that. And that helps as well that those revenues are typically paid in advance, annually in advance as opposed to carrying long -- bigger receivables. So really, the transaction business is probably the biggest grower of improved margins and cash flow.\nLynn Moore: Yes. And the follow-up question on AI and sales. I mean, it's -- clients aren't looking for AI for AI's sake but there are -- when you look at our CSI acquisition, the document redaction solution, there's an ROI involved. There's an ROI for the clients. And that's a big sales point. They can do things with that system that used to take a lot of people to do, and they've removed that manual labor, that manual toil. And so yes, things like that are driving sales.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to President and CEO, Lynn Moore, for closing remarks.\nLynn Moore: All right. Thanks, Rob, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Lynn. Total revenues for the quarter were $543.3 million, up 9.8% and organically grew 9.4%. Subscriptions revenue increased 17.6% and organically rose 17.3%. Within subscription, SaaS revenues grew 20.3% to $166.6 million and grew organically 19.7% against a tough comparison with last year's third quarter. Keep in mind that there's often a lag from the signing of a new SaaS dealer flip to the start of revenue recognition, they can vary from one to several quarters. Because of this, as well as the timing of SaaS renewals and related price increases, SaaS revenue growth both year-over-year and sequentially may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Transaction revenues grew 15.2% to $180.5 million, driven by higher transaction volumes from both new and existing clients, including the August go-live of the California Department of Parks and Recreation. SaaS deals comprised approximately 97% of our Q3 new software contract value compared to 80% last year. During the quarter, we added 181 new SaaS arrangements and converted 108 existing on-premises clients to SaaS, with a total contract value of approximately $141 million. In Q3 of last year, we added 161 new SaaS arrangements and had 79 flips with a total contract value of approximately $71 million. The average ARR from new SaaS contracts increased 38% over last year. The average ARR associated with our Q3 flips increased 37% over last year as larger clients such as Cobb County, Georgia and Providence, Rhode Island flips to the cloud. Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.85 billion, up 12.1% and organically grew 11.8%. We entered 2024 expecting operating margin expansion after experiencing the margin trough from our cloud transition in 2023. Our non-GAAP operating margin in the third quarter was 25.4% up 60 basis points from last year. The margin expansion reflects the impact of our cloud efficiency initiatives, along with effective operating expense management and improved professional services margins. As we discussed on previous calls, merchant and interchange fees from our payment business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins as they are passed through to clients and are included in both revenues and cost of revenues. We incurred merchant fees of approximately $42 million in Q3 compared to $36 million last year. Because of strong earnings and effective working capital management, both cash flows, operations and free cash flow reached new quarterly highs at $263.7 million and $252.9 million, respectively, with free cash flow up 55.5%. Cash flow in the quarter was positively impacted by the deferral to the fourth quarter of approximately $14 million of federal tax payments. We ended the quarter with $600 million of convertible debt outstanding and cash and investments of approximately $548 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 0.1 times trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. In September, we replaced our existing $500 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a new facility that matures in 2029, increasing the size to $700 million in improving terms. This new revolver further improves our available liquidity and provide us with maximum flexibility to address potential financing needs. Our updated 2024 annual guidance is as follows: we expect total revenues will be between $2.125 billion and $2.145 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 9%. We expect that merchant fees will be up approximately 7% over last year and that implied organic growth, excluding merchant fees would be approximately 20 basis points higher. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $6.13 and $6.28 and may vary significantly due to the impact of discrete tax items on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $9.47 and $9.62. We expect our free cash flow margin will be between 21% and 23%, including an estimated impact of approximately $54 million of incremental cash taxes related to Section 174. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q3 earnings deck posted on our website. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn. As we said, these can be a little bit lumpy. This was a strong quarter with some larger flips, but that's a trend that we're seeing, more of our larger customers that have been slower to flip to the cloud, more complicated projects are now starting to move at a faster pace and the progress we've made with version consolidation over the last couple of years has also helped get us in a position to facilitate that as more of those customers are now on current versions of software and have gone through that upgrade process to put them in a position to move to the cloud. So I think as we've said in the past, we should expect to continue to see growth in the flip volume and the size of flips and we sort of envision a bell curve-shaped trend of those over the next 3 or 4 years, and we're still kind of moving up the left-hand side of that bell curve. But it could be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. But generally, we expect to continue to see the flips growth to achieve the targets we set out for 2030 of 80% to 85% of our on-prem base having moved to the cloud by then. And really not any changes in linearity, we tend not to be super back-end loaded within quarters, and I don't think we've seen any change in that. Sure. Well, we're obviously not ready to give our '25 guidance yet and we're in our planning process and kind of in the early stages of that. I think what we've talked about is that we're probably a little bit ahead of where we targeted 2025 along the path to our 2030 targets. But we said it's not linear. And being a little bit ahead doesn't necessarily mean where we finish up '25 or 2030 will be significantly ahead of those initial targets. So we're confident around those. I think specifically on the cash flow side, we're certainly well ahead of that. We're above where we targeted 2025 already. There are some things that have been affected this year that are a little bit more onetime. But I think generally, this would be a level we'd look to build off of for 2025. So I do expect that '25, our cash flow will be at least kind of consistent with where we are this year. I don't think there's really a change in the seasonality. And typically, the last half of the year is slower in terms of volumes. But that's been offset really by a couple of things. One is the revenues from new payments clients that we've added over the course of the last year, we've been disclosing those numbers. And consistently close to a couple of hundred this quarter, significantly above that in terms of the number of new payments customers that we're adding within our software client base. And we're also having better experience in getting those clients live faster and getting those revenues flowing faster from the time we sign them to the time that they're onboarded, and that's having a positive impact. And then within the transactions business in general, what we alluded to in terms of some new customers to the California State Parks contract that we signed late last year went live this quarter. That added about $3 million of revenue, although it wasn't a full quarter impact. Various things like in Florida with our payments contract the Florida turnpikes with SunPass went live during the quarter, and that added a couple of million dollars of new revenues. So it's really a combination of new business as well as increased volume. So we're seeing greater adoption through our client base, and we're working with our clients to help them get more of their citizens doing things online and running through our systems. Yes, I think so. We're kind of at a little bit higher level than we had initially planned. I don't know that we would grow in terms of a margin significantly from where we are right now. But again, that's ahead of where we plan to be. The biggest onetime thing, which really will be reflected in the fourth quarter that's reflected in our full year guidance is what Lynn mentioned around the Kentucky courts contract where they are prepaying or prepaid in October, 6 years of SaaS payments. So there's a $29 million bump. That's not a typical situation that we see we're happy to accept that payment, but it's not typical. So that's the biggest onetime thing we're seeing that pull forward. ARPA funds. But those do -- until the end of '26 to send those dollars. So some of those things that ARPA funds will be used for may not even have started. They may have been committed but internally, but haven't even started the buying process. And just, for example, like with the Kentucky deal, even though they're using ARPA funds to pay 6 years of SaaS, that was a 12-year sales process from the time we started talking to them. So the deal didn't materialize because of ARPA funds, but it affected -- so we wouldn't say that, that deal just happened because of ARPA and wouldn't have happened without it, but it certainly benefited the timing of it. Yes. So just as Lynn said, less services in the mix. Services are lowest margin, and in fact, historically, have had a negative margin. So the combination of less services in the mix from all those factors that Lynn mentioned, combined with improving margins on the services we are doing should continue to have a positive impact on our margins. And we pointed that out as one of the not the biggest, but one of the factors in driving towards our 2030 margin targets. But with respect to version consolidation specifically, I guess, you call it a stick is that we actually are sunsetting older versions and giving clients certainly ample notice. But letting clients know the version they're on, the oldest versions will no longer be supported after a certain date and working with them to move them to the current version for that date. And we've done that with multiple products. We've sunset multiple old versions of our enterprise ERP solution, our Enterprise Justice solution and have made significant progress in moving those customers to current versions as we discontinue support of the older versions. Yes. It's probably more the latter. I don't think there's a certain characteristic or something that's causing that. It's probably around the timing, especially bigger customers, and it varies by market. For example, in the schools market, which is smaller for us, but they typically have a big push more in Q2 because they want to have new systems live before a new school year starts. Fiscal years don't really have as much to do with it. So I think it's more circumstantial. Yes. The prepayment was really kind of a one-off thing where at least relative to that size of that were -- and that actually will show up in the fourth quarter cash flow.

            "name": "Lynn Moore",
            "content": "Thanks, Hala. We carried our momentum from the first half of the year into the third quarter and delivered remarkably strong results. The quarter was highlighted by strong top and bottom line performance, even as we saw a more pronounced shift towards SaaS and our new software contract mix, particularly in public safety, where expected on-premise license deals shifted to SaaS contracts in the quarter resulting in license revenues that were below plan. SaaS and transaction revenues fueled our growth and both exceeded our expectations. Our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 25.4%, benefiting from our cloud efficiency initiatives and improved professional services margins and free cash flow reached a new quarterly high. As we've discussed in the past, our progress towards our 2025 and 2030 targets will not be linear. But our results through the first 9 months of this year bolster our confidence in achieving those top targets. We are beginning to see benefits from our cloud operations initiatives with efficiencies reflected in our results somewhat ahead of plan. Recurring revenues grew 12.1% and comprised 85% of our total revenues. Our SaaS revenues growth of 20.3% represents our 15th consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more, consistent with our target of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025. The public sector market remains robust, supported by healthy budgets and an increased focus on modernizing aging mission-critical systems through cloud adoption. The strong market activity we've discussed for the past few quarters along with excellent execution by our sales teams, is reflected in our new software bookings this quarter with our new SaaS contract value of approximately $105.6 million, up 78% over last year. Our leading market position, anchored by our deep domain expertise and large installed base forms the foundation of our long-term strategic focus on 4 key growth drivers: executing our cloud-first strategy, leveraging our unmatched installed base, expanding into new markets and growing our payments business. Our cloud-first strategy is a pivotal driver of our success and continues to shape our future in our cloud living culture. We are leading with cloud across our product portfolio as the public sector market continues to embrace digital modernization and choose Tyler's next-generation cloud solutions. Additionally, we've made substantial progress with our cloud optimization efforts, driving efficiencies and scalability, while also making solid progress on version consolidation to further accelerate on-premise client migrations and enable clients to easily expand their mission-critical applications in the cloud. The pendulum is continuing to shift to the cloud with both new and existing clients, and we are seeing a growing trend of client-driven SaaS adoption. This is especially apparent in areas that have previously lagged the rest of our market in terms of cloud adoption, most notably, the public safety market, along with the state and federal market with our application platform. Overall, SaaS arrangements comprised 97% of our new software contract value in the third quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, 100% of our public safety new contract value was SaaS compared to only 28% a year ago. It was also a great quarter for flip signings as we signed a total of 108 flips of on-premises clients. The total contract value from flips was more than triple that of last year's third quarter, and the average ARR of flips rose 37.2%. Our Courts & Justice business was very active in the third quarter. Our largest deal in the quarter was a contract with Kentucky Court of Justice for Enterprise Justice suite, including case manager, e-filing and court analytics in addition to payments. The initial 6-year term represents $35 million in total contract value, although only $10.6 million was recorded in bookings in backlog this quarter due to contract provisions. ARR starts at approximately $2.5 million and grows to $6.5 million in year 6, in addition to payments processing under a gross revenue model. Of note, the first 6 years of SaaS fees totaling $29 million was prepaid in October using ARPA funds. Other successful Tyler court clients and in particular, the North Carolina Administrative Office of the Courts served as strong references in this competitive sales process that span more than 12 years. Kentucky is our 17th statewide courts client and our third statewide enterprise justice solution deployed in the cloud. We also signed a 3-year $9.6 million SaaS contract for our Enterprise Justice suite with the Phoenix, Arizona Municipal Court. That agreement includes a cooperative master purchase agreement provision that enabled the Arizona Supreme Court to designate Tyler as a preferred software provider for all 170 courts in the state, including superior, justice and municipal courts, with the alternative option being the state's aging legacy system. We're excited about the opportunity to expand our partnership across Arizona courts with significant potential ARR. Other notable third quarter SaaS deals included a $12 million 5-year contract with the city of St. Petersburg, Florida, the fifth largest in the state for enterprise permitting and licensing and enterprise ERP utility billing solutions along with payments. We signed 6 SaaS contracts for our enterprise public safety solution, including 2 of the fastest-growing cities in the U.S., the City of Frisco, Texas Police Department for $750,000 in ARR and the City of Round Rock, Texas police for $730,000 in ARR. Central to our growth is leveraging our unmatched installed base and expanding our addressable market through strategic cross-sell and upsell activity that unlocks significant expansion opportunities with both new and existing clients. A key cross-sell win this quarter was a multiyear strategic contract with the Texas Office of Court Administration for our Texas Connected Justice Data Cloud. This includes alliance exchange, enterprise data platform, open data platform and our Digital Solutions division's engagement builder platform. This integrated solution captures real-time online data across every jurisdiction in the state. This multiyear engagement exemplifies our connected communities vision by creating a digital infrastructure for data sharing and decision-useful business intelligence and reporting. The contract adds $1.5 million in ARR and is the first of its kind in a large population state, paving the way for additional add-on opportunities. Another significant cross-sell win was a contract for the modernization of 18 different boards with the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation for our state regulatory application platform suite which also brings in augmented field operations, formerly ARInspect. The 3-year contract leveraged our Illinois state enterprise agreement and represents $9.2 million in total contract value, with a 7-year option that adds $12.5 million in total contract value. We're pleased to see an increasing number of our clients modernizing their enterprise solutions using our application platform. Driving payments adoption of our differentiated payments business is another key element in our growth strategy. In the third quarter, we signed 268 new payment deals across Tyler software clients, representing approximately $8.6 million in projected ARR. Riverside County, an existing property and recording software client is our first enterprise payments win in California. This collaborative effort expanded from initial property and recording payments contracts to processing payments for more than 10 agencies across the county, which is the fourth most populated county in California. In our enterprise portal business, we secured extensions for our digital government and payment processing services in 5 states, which includes winning competitive rebids for state enterprise portals in New Jersey and Indiana. We also expanded our scope with the state of Indiana to include resident engagement identity proofing for approximately $1 million in additional ARR. This builds on Tyler's chatbot front-end technology recently deployed representing the first AI project for Indiana and its residents. This solution was provided through a joint effort with our AI task force and our Indian state enterprise team in collaboration with the Indiana Office of Technology. Now I'd like Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our updated annual guidance for 2024. Thanks, Brian. As we close out another strong quarter, I want to highlight the consistently high level of execution and collaboration across our teams, which is even more critical to our ongoing success as we leverage a fully enabled cloud infrastructure to deliver continuous innovation and enhanced client experience. The strength of our One Tyler team is rooted in a shared commitment to excellence and to our mission, vision and values, which drives our ability to execute at high levels. During the quarter, we were recognized by Newsweek as one of America's greenest companies, placing us among the top 500 greenest companies in the United States based on environmental sustainability. We were also named the Newsweek's America's greatest workplaces for parents and families 2024 list. We're gratified by this recognition of our commitment to fostering a strong inclusive culture with a healthy work-life balance and high-quality benefits. Now we'd like to open up the line for Q&A. Yes. Just to amplify, Ken, Brian is right. It will tend to be lumpy. I don't think I would model this as our new run rate, which was your question. But we do expect to see this continued momentum. Yes. That's a good question. We're actually not seeing any slowdowns or hesitations due to the election. Generally speaking, when you look across all the business units at Tyler and particularly at our flagship products, most of our divisions are either at or exceeding their sales plans for the year. And so that's been good. The things that we've been talking in the past couple of quarters have continued. And so we're not seeing any slowdown at this point or any pauses due to any macro factors or the election. I think generally stepping back, the competitive landscape is has been pretty neutral throughout the year. I wouldn't say there's been any significant increased competition or any decreased competition. As you know, all of our -- I think when you look at our -- the subverticals like ERP, we certainly see more competition from players that are more horizontal players like Workday, we see them -- I don't know that we see them a significant amount more than we have in the past. When you talk about ServiceNow and our -- against our platform solution, we see them in that space, but we're kind of a different offering. And a lot of the things that were -- the application platform plays best is are areas where ServiceNow is really probably a little bit bigger and heavier. So overall, I think the competitive landscape is generally the same. I think our -- when I look at win rates, they've generally been consistent and were consistent in Q3 with what we've been experiencing over the past several quarters and probably a couple of years. Yes. And to amplify that a little, Michael, I mean Brian is right. We are starting to experience -- we're learning better. The onboarding efficiencies is bringing revenue recognition faster, which is great. The California State go live, I want to emphasize that for a minute because that's a big deal. I mean, we signed this contract late last year in less than 3 quarters, we were up and live. And remember, this is the largest contract in Tyler's history. And we've talked about this sometimes on the call, and it gets lost sometimes in the numbers. But really, the secret sauce of Tyler is execution. And it's our sales execution. It's our implementation execution, it's our support, it's management. And it just -- it takes a lot to do what we do. And we signed over 200 new deals, 100 flips a quarter. That's a lot of business that's going on, and it's the work of our teams and the execution is what provides that referenceability that keeps the engine running. And to get a big go-live in California to go basically on time and on budget is really a great accomplishment for our teams and sets us up not only well to execute on that contract. But then to -- for others to look at that success and duplicate that in other jurisdictions. Yes. Good questions, Terry. I'll start with the second one. The answer to that is yes. I think part of the part of the equation of doing flips is it brings actually the uptake, we call it more upselling. But yes, that is part of that equation. And I do think it's something. It's another opportunity for us to be in front of the client. Another opportunity to add additional products as they're making another decision. On cross-selling, there's a lot of things that go into that. And I would say things that we have done internally over the last year, 12, 18 months have played a significant role in that. I've talked -- I think I've talked about that on some prior calls, things that we've done around how we comp our sales people, how we comp the different divisions what that basis is. And we've moved to a more of a One Tyler compensation level so that basically, if there are multiple divisions that are contributing to a sales process, we don't have to fight over who's getting the credit because the credit, it shouldn't really matter, if's Tyler wins. And so we've done things internally that I think have broken down internal barriers that have just sort of, I think, grease the wheels a little bit more. In terms of product suites, it's funny, yes, some tend to go a little bit more than others. Sometimes you may get some Courts & Justice products that tie well to our Public Safety products. Sometimes, for example, we did a significant deal this quarter in Kenosha, Wisconsin. That was our ERP full suite. It would also include enterprise, appraisal and tax including our municipal justice. Big integrated story, Gartner-led procurement about $1.6 million in ARR. So while there are products that sort of sometimes naturally seem to go together, our integrated story and the Tyler story tends to also sometimes bring products together in deals that you might not necessarily think on the face of it that, that would have been an inclusive sale, but we're seeing that. We also saw that in St. Petersburg, Florida. I think I mentioned that in my prepared remarks. That was enterprise permanent license, but it also brought in our utility billing and payments. That was almost a $2 million ARR deal. So we're seeing progress and a lot of it is the result of some internal initiatives, and it's just the more success we're having in the market and selling that sort of integrated story of Tyler is resonating. No, good question, Josh. I think I talked about on the last call, version consolidation is a big piece of what we call Phase 1 of our cloud transition. And each of our flagship products have been going at different paces because they have different starting points. I would say, generally speaking, sitting here in the fall of 2024, I'm pleased with where we are at version consolidation. I think we're ahead of where I thought we would have been looking back 2 or 3 years ago. And some of our products, this is a heavier lift. But if you look, for example, at our Courts & Justice, our Enterprise Justice solution, you look at our enterprise ERP solution, we have an overwhelming number of clients now that are down to 1 or 2 versions, far removed from the days of having 5, 6, 7 versions out in the field. I think that's part of what you're seeing with our outperformance this year. We talked about our margin outperformance being driven in part by some of our cloud efficiencies. Those cloud efficiencies are -- our products are getting more optimized to be run in AWS. But we're also seeing the benefits of that version consolidation. It takes a lot less people to maintain and support fixed bugs on a single version or even 2 versions than 6 or 7 versions. And that's part of what we're looking at when we start talking about Phase 2 of our cloud strategy, which is what we call cloud living. It's getting all of our clients onto that single version, getting them on really short release cycles, less disruptive, large versions out in the field, higher client set. So I think we're making really good progress there. I do expect that to continue to help gross margins as we look towards our Tyler 2030 goals, that's where some of that gross margin improvement is going to come. And again, I'm pleased with where we're at right now on version consolidation. Yes, Gabriela, I think overall, I mean, budgets have been at a pretty good level for, I'd say, a couple of years now. And I can't predict what's going to happen 3 or 5 years from now. I can't even predict what's going to happen in 2 weeks with the election. But I think our outlook right now and what we're seeing in leading sales indicators is we see that continue -- that level staying for the foreseeable future, our RFP counts, our demo counts, all those leading sales indicators are strong and are consistent with prior quarters and really the last couple of years. And so those are really the data points that I look at most. I'm sorry, I forgot the second question. ARPA funds have been an interesting topic over the last several years. There are certain deals that were clearly driven by ARPA funds. We talked about the Kentucky Enterprise Justice deal where they prepaid that all up front. We also had a significant deal, the Arizona Supreme Court deal that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, was also funded by ARPA funds. We don't always know and we haven't always known when ARPA is the trigger and what we've said over the past, sometimes, it's not the direct trigger, but it may have freed up other opportunities. There's been a hesitancy sometimes in our business to use ARPA funds given the recurring nature, they sometimes tend to have been used more on onetime things. We saw that sort of in our student transportation business, maybe for a large purchase of hardware, something like that. I think they've been helpful over the last few years. I don't think that's been a major tailwind to growth in sales. That's not what we're hearing from our sales folks. Yes, that's a good question. And actually, I'll start a little bit, too, with what you asked Brian, is part of our outperformance this year has been our services gross margins. And that has been something that we have focused on at a management level over the last couple of years, and you're starting to see some of that. So a good management focus and attention. It's also been a function of the labor market. So the labor markets have really stabilized. We're seeing a lot less turnover and high turnover in our services areas creates a lot of inefficiencies. It takes a long time for people to get onboarded, up to speed and out and billable. But we've had some other internal initiatives that really help drive those professional services. As we look out over the next several years, I would expect our services to remain relatively flat. In fact, next year, they may actually decrease a little bit. That's a function of a couple of things. I think it is a function of efficiencies and how we can onboard clients. We've done some internal initiatives around that which also a function of in our -- some of our really large implementations, like in Courts & Justice and a lot of customization work. We're moving away from that. We don't have as many of those on the horizon and the whole concept of clients having one-off custom applications is something that we are moving. It's part of our cloud living goals as move forward. So it's a number of factors there. It is something that's been a focus of it. But you're right, it has been declining as a percentage of revenues. And as I look out, I would expect it to stay flat to decline as compared to other growth in our revenue lines. I think some of the reasons are just some of the historic reasons, control. You've got people maybe who are not -- have been there a long time. They're used to having control of their systems, control of everything. I think what happens is, we've talked about aging technology, but also aging infrastructure starts to lead to more and more openness to flips. I think you also see the increase in cyber attacks, creating a different sort of demand and new demand for flips. But I think also we talk a lot about how everything we do is public. Every implementation we do all -- every county, every city looks at their neighbors, looks across jurisdictions to see what's going on. And whatever hesitancy that people may have felt 5 years ago, 7 years ago, as they see their neighboring jurisdictions make those decisions and the success that they're having, and I'll go back to my comment earlier about our success in executing and they see us being able to get them up and live and running in a better environment. I think that starts to break down those barriers as we move forward. Yes, Rob, I don't know that we're doing anything different than we've done in the last couple of years. All of our sales teams have been armed with information on ARPA funds. They're armed with the right marketing materials. They generally know what's around. They've got their talking points. But I'll reiterate, I don't think -- I can't draw a direct correlation over the last few years of ARPA funds to Tyler's performance in a material way. It has definitely been part of the overall environment. But again, as I said, as I look at indicators going out into the future, the things that we track that sort of help us track demand and budgets. Those are remaining pretty consistent right now. So I'm not suggesting that ARPA hasn't been helpful. I just -- I have not been able to really draw a material one-on-one direct correlation to that other than, obviously, some deals, but the Kentucky deal. I think the interesting thing about that is it sometimes -- it highlights really sometimes the long nature of these sales processes and the tenacity of us and the long-term nature of everything we do in our long-term vision and staying power there was 12 years later, and we benefited from cash flow with ARPA funds, but we were going to get that deal whether ARPA funds were available or not. Yes. Jonathan, it's -- we're starting to see a little bit of questions in RFPs around AI and what AI technology we're using, how we're leveraging it. I don't think anything right now has changed from what we've said over the last couple of quarters. We're focusing our efforts on sort of right now, trying to decide where exactly we want to put most of our resources behind AI internal versus external facing solutions. I still continue to believe that there's a lot of applicability pointing inward in things that we can do on repetitive type activity that some of our employees do. But we have seen an uptick. I mean we made the acquisition of CSI last year. AI is a deeply embedded part of that solution is having a lot of success in the market. ARInspect has some AI tools, and I mentioned the ARInspect deal on the portion of the Illinois deal that I talked about earlier. So we're doing things around AI. Customers are starting to be more open about talking about it. I think a year ago, clients were probably really hesitant. It's not a driver right now in deals, but they're curiosity and their interest is starting to surface. And my guess is we'll hear more about it when we get together connect next year and probably even more about it the following year. Yes, Keith, we're viewing it similarly. I mean, I've talked about the last couple of years, our priority is debt pay down. Our cash balances are approaching what our convertibles do in about 16, 17 months. And so we're looking. We always look. We've been looking, I look at deals every quarter. we're probably a little pickier right now than we might otherwise be. But I do think as we go into 2025 and then into 2026, we're not going to change our standards. We're not going to change our valuation approach. But I do think you'll see us -- I'll probably evaluate more and maybe a deal that we might have said, \u201cHey, maybe we don't do it right now, that might tip in that direction\u201d. We don't have anything specific right now in the hopper. We do talk internally about really what's the best area for us to go get our bang for a buck. And should we sort of start being a little more proactive as opposed to reactive. Those are discussions we're having internally. But generally, as it relates to capital, our stance is kind of the same right now, but I can see that evolving over the next 12, 18 months. Yes, sure, Alex. The short answer is, yes, when we gave our 2030 targets, we did not bake in efficiencies, internal efficiencies on any gross margin lines that were going to be driven by AI nor did we really bake in any sales that were really a result of either new products, products, newly developed products or newly acquired products. To the extent, AI was already in some of our products, we already had sort of some long-term sales road maps. So perhaps a little bit, but not in terms of additional R&D, additional M&A. And so that's the way I would think about it. I'd just remember that we're taking a very deliberative approach to AI. And while I say that we're hearing more and more customers start to have things in their RFPs around AI. It's not a majority yet. And I think our clients will still be a little bit conservative. But when you start looking out 5, 7 years, those opportunities are there, and we're not going to wait 5 to 7 years to then spin up initiatives. We will be doing those along the way. And to the extent there was some major R&D initiative, which hypothetically because that's not right now on our road map and it adjusted our -- an R&D expense line or something we would obviously signal that and tell you that. But in terms of our long-term targets, no, no significant AI benefits, either margin or revenue were baked in. Yes. And the follow-up question on AI and sales. I mean, it's -- clients aren't looking for AI for AI's sake but there are -- when you look at our CSI acquisition, the document redaction solution, there's an ROI involved. There's an ROI for the clients. And that's a big sales point. They can do things with that system that used to take a lot of people to do, and they've removed that manual labor, that manual toil. And so yes, things like that are driving sales. All right. Thanks, Rob, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, July 25, 2024. I would like to turn the call over to Hala Elsherbini, Tyler's Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nHala Elsherbini: Thank you, Matt, and welcome to our call. With me today is Lynn Moore, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. After I give the safe harbor statement, Lynn will have some initial comments on our quarter, and then Brian will review the details of our results and update our annual guidance for 2024. Lynn will end with some additional comments, and then we'll take your questions. During this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the Company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from these projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Also, in our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We have also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financials tab, schedules with supplemental information, including information about quarterly recurring revenues and bookings. On the Events and Presentations tab, we posted an earnings summary slide deck to supplement our prepared remarks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn?\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Hala. We built on the momentum from our strong first quarter performance to, again, deliver exceptional second quarter results marked by consistently high execution and a continuation of solid operating and financial performance. Each of our key metrics across revenues, earnings, operating margin and cash flow exceeded our expectations. These results are especially meaningful given the significant shift towards SaaS in our new software contract mix, which pressured revenues and margins. Recurring revenues grew 8.4% and comprised 83% of our total revenues. SaaS revenues grew 23.2%, our 14th consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more above our target of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025. In addition, transaction revenues were ahead of plan driven by higher transaction volumes, including an increase in e-filing volumes and expanded payment services. Since committing to our cloud-first strategy in 2019, we've been intently focused on supporting our public sector's clients' digital transformation and guiding their migration to Tyler's next-generation cloud applications. Last year, we reached an inflection point where valuable, long-term recurring SaaS revenues surpassed on-premises' license and maintenance revenues. We're pleased to reach another milestone as we have now essentially completed the exit of our Dallas data center. This move is a significant achievement in our cloud migration road map as we continue to scale our deployments at AWS and drive more durable growth and margin benefits from our SaaS-based operating model. The public sector market remains healthy, characterized by high levels of RFP and sales demo activity. Our new business pipeline remains at elevated levels, reflecting the robust market environment, growing cross-sell opportunities and continued strong execution by our sales organization. Our leading market position and competitive strengths, including our deep domain expertise continue to differentiate us in the marketplace. These strengths underpin our long-term strategic focus on four key growth drivers, leveraging our unmatched installed base, expanding into new markets, completing our cloud transition and growing our payments business. Our large client base represents one of our most significant assets, and we're pleased to see strong go-to-market execution with significant cross-sell and upsell wins during the quarter, which included a joint effort with our Justice Group, leveraging our Digital Solution division's strong relationships in Florida, for an agreement with the Florida Department of Corrections to manage all aspects of money transfer services for correctional facilities across the state. The contract brings together disbursement solutions from our Rapid Financial Solutions acquisition, inmate trust and accounting and e-communications from the VendEngine acquisitions and payments through our Digital Solutions division. A single sourced enterprise supervision and enterprise public safety contract with Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma, adding to its existing enterprise ERP solutions. The SaaS agreement was a joint collaborative sales effort resulting in a total Tyler client win. Additionally, we continue to innovate and elevate our clients' resident engagement experience by empowering citizens with direct connections to government through Tyler's MyCivic platform. In Mississippi, we expanded citizen access to mental health resources with the Mississippi State Department of Health, leveraging our state enterprise agreement. We continue to advance our cloud transition and make substantial progress with our product version consolidation efforts, which will accelerate our continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. We're also pleased with the numerous second quarter SaaS contract wins, which underscore the public sector market's recognition of cloud benefits, including enhanced security. One of the key themes that emerged during client interactions at our recent Connect 2024 user conference was a notable shift in client openness to embrace cloud technology and a growing expectation among on-premises clients that they will migrate to the cloud. This shift is especially apparent in the state and federal market with our application platform and in the public safety market, where 90% of second quarter public safety contract value was SaaS compared to 13% a year ago. Primarily as a result of this accelerated shift in public safety cloud adoption, SaaS arrangements comprised 97% of our new software contract value in the second quarter. Additionally, we signed 111 flips of on-premises clients, including a number of larger clients, with the average ARR flips growing 21.8%. We also had a very successful go-live in May with the SaaS migration of the Idaho State Court system. This is our first flip to the cloud of a statewide court system, and Idaho went live just four months after the project kicked off. This high-profile migration has been watched closely by other statewide and large county courts and its successful execution is certainly a positive reference point as we engage with other large core clients about moving to the cloud. Key second quarter new SaaS deals and flips included a competitive win with the City of Topeka, Kansas for multiple integrated solutions, including enterprise ERP, enterprise permitting & licensing, enterprise asset management for nearly $700,000 in ARR. And ERP Pro and Payments contract with Richland County, Wisconsin, funded via ARPA funds. That was executed on an accelerated 90-day sales cycle, leveraging our enhanced sales enablement and competitive intel teams. The Idaho State Police signed a SaaS contract for our integrated enterprise public safety suite including CAD, records management and e-citations. This Tier 1 competitive win demonstrates our growing momentum with state public safety agencies and represents the sixth state police agency to adopt our enterprise public safety solutions. The United County, New York Department of Emergency Services also chose our integrated Public Safety Suite for 64 agency client-driven, SaaS deployment. Hunt County, Texas, upgraded to Enterprise Public Safety from our Public Safety Pro solution and Spotsylvania County, Virginia, signed a contract for our enforcement Mobile Solutions, joining eight of the 14 largest Virginia agencies using Tyler Public Safety applications. We signed an enterprise justice SaaS flip with Fulton County, Georgia, which includes Atlanta. The contract with ARR of $1.9 million follows Fulton County's Enterprise appraisal and tax SaaS flip signed in the first quarter, and includes integrated justice solutions such as prosecutor and jail as well as additional client management services under our unified One Tyler approach. We also signed an enterprise supervision expansion with the Arizona Supreme Court that builds on the success of adult probation to add juvenile probation for all 15 counties across the state. We leveraged the state relationship, which led to a five-year enterprise justice agreement with the Phoenix Municipal Court, representing in excess of $2.25 million in ARR. This strategic and highly competitive win includes five one-year extension options and paves the way for expansion and new court software opportunities in a large population state. Another theme coming out of Connect '24 was pronounced interest in AI and our expanded AI capabilities that were added through our 2023 acquisitions. High interest is turning into multiple new deals and cross-sell wins for our application platform, leveraging our augmented field operation solutions, formerly ARInspect with four inspection SaaS arrangements in the quarter across state, environmental, health and regulatory agencies. These included the California State Board of Pharmacy to configure and automate five regulatory inspection types, the Kentucky Department Environmental Protection, the New York Department of Health and the Arkansas Department of Labor and Licensing, which was a cross-sell win leveraging our Digital Solutions division state enterprise relationship. Another key to our growth strategy is expanding our differentiated payments business. And similar to our first quarter results, higher transaction volumes contributed to better-than-expected transaction revenues. In the second quarter, we signed 195 new payments deals across Tyler Software clients, representing approximately $8 million in projected ARR. In our state enterprise portal business, we secured extensions for our digital government and payment processing services under four state enterprise contracts, including Hawaii, New Jersey, Kansas and Kentucky and also won a sole source award with the state of Rhode Island as no extensions remained under the previous contract. We also signed a two-year renewal with the state of Illinois for our Outdoor and Enterprise Licensing Solutions. Now I'd like Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our updated annual guidance for 2024.\nBrian Miller: Thanks, Lynn. Total revenues for the quarter were $541 million, up 7.3% and organically grew 6.5%. Subscriptions revenue increased 12.1% and organically rose 11.8%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew 23.2% to $156 million and grew organically 22.5%. Keep in mind that there's often a lag from the signing of a new SaaS flip or SaaS deal or flip to the start of revenue recognition that can vary from one to several quarters. Because of this, as well as the timing of SaaS renewals and related price increases, SaaS revenue growth both year-over-year and sequentially may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Transaction revenues grew 3.8% to $177.7 million. Transaction revenues exceeded our plan, primarily due to higher transaction volumes from new and existing clients, including recreational licenses such as hunting and fishing, which begin their peak season during Q2. In addition, e-filing revenues grew 11.2%. The year-over-year comparison for transaction revenues continued to be impacted by the change in mid-2023 from the gross model to the net model for payments under one of our state enterprise agreements. This will no longer be a factor in year-over-year growth comparisons in the second half of the year, and our expectation is for mid- to high teens growth in transaction revenues in the second half of 2024. SaaS deals comprised approximately 97% of our Q2 new software contract value compared to 82% last year. During the quarter, we added 203 new SaaS arrangements and converted 111 existing on-premises clients to SaaS with a total contract value of approximately $127 million. In Q2 of last year, we added 170 new SaaS arrangements and had 94 on-premises conversions with total contract value of approximately $93 million. More importantly, the average ARR associated with our Q2 flips increased 21.8% over last year as larger clients such as Fulton and Clayton Counties in in Metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia; the cities of Tucson, Arizona and Birmingham, Alabama; and the Columbus, Ohio City schools flipped to the cloud, including transaction revenues, expansions with existing clients and professional services, total bookings increased 7.3% on an organic basis. Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.8 billion, up 8.4% and organically grew 7.8%. In previous quarters, we discussed our expectation that 2023 would be the operating margin trough from our cloud transition and that 2024 would mark a return to operating margin expansion. Our non-GAAP operating margin in the second quarter was 24.5%, up 150 basis points from last year. The margin expansion reflects improved margins from our cloud operations, along with expensive effective operating expense management and improving professional services margins. As we discussed on previous calls, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins as they are passed through to clients and are included in both revenues and cost of revenues. We incurred merchant fees of approximately $45 million in Q2. Because of strong earnings and effective working capital management, both cash flows from operations and free cash flow were above expectations for the quarter at $64.3 million and $48.6 million, respectively. Cash flow in the quarter was impacted by approximately $29 million of incremental cash taxes due to Section 174. We ended the quarter with $600 million of convertible debt outstanding and cash and investments of approximately $262 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 0.65x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. Our updated 2024 annual guidance is as follows: We expect total revenues will be between $2.120 billion and $2.150 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 9%. We expect that merchant fees will be up approximately 6% over last year, and then implied organic growth, excluding merchant fees, would be approximately 20 basis points higher. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.76 and $5.96 and may vary significantly due to the impact of discrete tax items on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $9.25 and $9.45. We expect our free cash flow margin will be between 18% and 20%, including an estimated impact of approximately $60 million of incremental cash taxes related to Section 174. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q2 earnings deck posted on our website. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Brian. Our exceptional performance in the first half of 2024 positions us well for a strong second half. We're pleased with our progress across all fronts as we remain on track with key initiatives around our four-pronged growth strategy while demonstrating our competitive strength and model durability. Our cloud transition is beginning to generate the expected benefits of margin improvement and enhanced client experience. As you know, in 2019, we launched a multiyear cloud strategy to shift our solutions and operations to a cloud-first business model, leading our clients to a future in the cloud. As we enter the next phase of our cloud journey, and as more new and existing clients embrace our cloud strategy, we see increasing opportunities to prove areas critical to our clients that ultimately affect client satisfaction, including product release cycles, product consistency, performance reliability and cost effectiveness. To effectively address these areas and lead this change, I'm pleased to share that Russell Gainford has been promoted to Chief Cloud Officer, effective immediately. Over the past three years, Russell has proven his ability to own the overall vision for Tyler's cloud-first strategy. And in his new capacity, he will continue to drive our cloud initiatives across our organization, including developing our cloud technology and operation standards, controls and business processes, overseeing our strategic business partner and vendor relationships as well as architecting the organizational design and staffing plans in collaboration with operational leaders. Shifting to capital allocation. Our disciplined approach bolsters our strong balance sheet as we've repaid our term debt during this period of higher interest rates. This coupled with our ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow provides tremendous flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to make investments that drive shareholder value, including product development, M&A and potentially stock buybacks. And while the bar is currently high for acquisitions, we continue to evaluate strategic tuck-in acquisitions, while building liquidity to be in a position to address our convertible debt maturity in March of '26. I'm also pleased to highlight that Tyler recently was recognized by two leading publications as we were included on Times list of America's best midsized companies and Forbes' Best Employers for Women's list. Before I close, I'd like to welcome our two new board members, Margot Carter and Andy Teed, who were elected at our May 9th Annual Meeting. Margot brings a wealth of experience in cloud software and SaaS transformations, AI and payments. She currently serves as President of Living Mountain Capital, where she invests in and advises companies and private equity firms on digital transformation and innovative strategies. She has an extensive background in finance M&A and corporate governance and has served on several public company boards. Andy is a seasoned technology executive with significant public sector experience. He currently serves as the CEO of Eco Parking Technologies, an integrated lighting and parking guidance company. Prior to that, Andy spent nearly 20 years at Tyler in various senior leadership roles. His extensive public sector experience and familiarity with our products and clients along with his knowledge of cloud technologies, make Andy a valuable addition to our Board. I also want to thank our two outgoing Board Directors, Dusty Womble and [Mary Landro] for their years of service and contributions to Tyler's success. Finally, I'd like to express my appreciation to our entire Tyler team for their hard work and continued commitment to driving growth while leading our clients on their digital modernization journeys. Our leadership is aligned with a unified focus on cloud living, and I've never been more confident in our prospects and Tyler's future. Now, we'd like to open the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Alexei Gogolev with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAlexei Gogolev: Thank you, Brian. Congratulations with great results. Brian, I was wondering the components of higher CapEx, what were they? If you could elaborate on that? And why are we seeing some decline in R&D? And does this have anything to do with your plans to reallocate certain R&D components? Remember, you were saying you were planning to do that for COGS going into OpEx?\nBrian Miller: Those two are related, but they're not related to any reclassification of R&D. They're just interrelated in terms of as we perform different R&D projects. Some of them fall in the category of requiring capitalization and others are expensed. And sometimes, there's a -- and this just reflects a little bit of a shift between those two. So more of our development costs are being expensed and less being -- I'm sorry, more being capitalized and less are being expensed to R&D. So, it's just a shift between capitalization and expense based on the nature of the projects.\nAlexei Gogolev: Understood. And then the second one about your AWS contract renewal. Could you elaborate on the potential benefits to gross margin and whether you think there will be a one-off benefit or you expect to unlock more discounts as you progress through the contract?\nLynn Moore: Yes, Alex, I think it's a couple of things. We did sign that long-term extension as we continue to commit more and more of our clients going into AWS and more and more spend each year, we do receive some additional discounts. So, I would expect those to continue. I think the other side is just -- is really just some of the operational efficiencies that we're starting to see the product optimization as we continue to optimize and move them into AWS version consolidation, the things that we've talked about. So, it's a number of factors, but I do expect looking forward that some of our gross margins would improve. I don't know that I would look -- I think as you look out over the next six, seven years, our Tyler 2030 vision, I would expect several of our gross margin lines to improve. I don't know that necessarily it's going to happen in the next 12 months, but we are making progress on all of those items.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Matt VanVliet with BTIG. Your line is now open.\nMatt VanVliet: Continuing to have more success at the state level, curious how much of that's being driven by the integration sort of more holistically on the sales team with the NIC team and sort of some of those hunting licenses versus the product maturation and the acceptance of cloud at that level. And as you look on a go-forward basis, how much of these deals are having sort of multiproduct together to where the more, I guess, combined sales effort is paying off here?\nLynn Moore: Yes, Matt, it's a good point. We are seeing more momentum, certainly more cross-sell momentum in that state space. I think it's a testament to our DSD division's long-standing relationships and really our enhanced focus on leveraging those these last couple of years. There's things that we've done. We've talked about in the last couple of earnings calls around compensation and sales commissions and also executive leadership compensation that sort of try to break down some of those barriers and enhance those cross-sell opportunities. We are seeing more and more multiproduct deals. I think I referenced a few in my notes earlier. And that again, that's just -- it's a testament to what we've been -- what I've been sort of calling for the last couple of years, this vision of one Tyler operating more as a singular unified company, breaking down any sort of internal barriers that might have been just a slight hindrance in the past around cross sells and upsells. And I think we're starting to see that pay off as relationships are continuing to forge and as they start to become more and more productive.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Rob Oliver with Baird. Your line is now open.\nRob Oliver: Great. Lynn, my question is for you. Just a pretty rapid and somewhat stunning, I guess, I would say, having followed you guys a long time increase in public safety's willingness -- public safety\u2019s customers willingness to adopt the cloud. And you guys clearly are right there to address that opportunity. I was just wondering this is one of the areas within core Tyler that has been historically the most competitive. And I think somewhat of a modest concern for investors. I was hoping you could address the extent to which this cloud move is really underscoring competitive advantages for you guys, perhaps the relationship with AWS as you take a sector of your market that historically was somewhat more reticent to move to the cloud, how that is helping you? And then as you look at that public safety pipeline where you see sort of current Tyler customers and where that cross-sell advantage might be?\nLynn Moore: Yes, you're right, Rob. Public safety has -- it's actually been a little bit surprising their results this year. At the end of last year and really coming into this year, we had made the decision that we were going to really lead our clients to the cloud sort of like the position we took across all of Tyler. And you're right, the momentum is there. Momentum is an interesting thing. And as you know, our clients talk and so I think right now, it is a competitive advantage for us. We are able to offer all of our core public safety products in a SaaS environment. That's not necessarily the case with all of our competitors. It's still a very competitive market. I like where we sit right now. I like some of our key wins or against some really key Tier 1 competitors, some that I mentioned in my remarks earlier, like Idaho State police deal. So, it's an interesting dynamic and one that I think is -- I talked earlier about momentum it is building momentum, and it's exciting to see. And I think we're also starting to see the impact of some of the cybersecurity concerns, which are -- they're heightened across all of our clients, but we've seen a number of flips. I think we had six flips in public safety in Q2. A couple of those were actually the result of some ransomware. And so being able to be nimble and stand up those clients very quickly, perhaps not with full functionality, but get them up and running where they can do their job has actually shown a lot of benefits and starting to give confidence to our clients and to their surrounding communities that the cloud is something that they should be looking at.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMichael Turrin: Great, looks like a strong Q2 for SaaS, fairly even split between new deals and conversions and the metrics. So, I was just hoping you could maybe speak to the drivers there. How you'd expect that mix between new deals and conversions likely trends. And if anything, seasonal in terms of Q2 and what we're looking at, we should be mindful of there?\nBrian Miller: Yes. I don't think there's anything particularly seasonal around the pace of those, both the timing of new deals and especially the timing of flips can be a little bit lumpy. So, we certainly expect the trend to continue to be over the mid- and long term for the number of flips and the size of flips to continue to increase. That was one of the big factors this quarter was that the average ARR from flips this quarter was up almost 20%, and we highlighted some of those larger flips that are taking place. But I think in general, obviously, we're at a very high percentage of SaaS at 97% of the new business. I think public safety still will have some license deals in the second half of the year. And so that may even fall back a little bit. But the trend that Lynn just described is certainly continuing of greater acceptance of SaaS and public safety. So, I think you'll continue to see the flips trend upward, although they may bounce around a little bit from quarter to quarter and that the continuing -- the vast majority of our new deals coming in and SaaS will also continue.\nLynn Moore: Yes. I think, Michael, too, I think when you look at the numbers and compare quarter-over-quarter from last year, we've talked about the public sector market and how budgets are healthy and sales pipeline is strong. I think you're seeing that. We had I think if you look at our total new software deals, it's up about 11% year-over-year. Our flips are actually up about 18% and our new SaaS deals were up about 20%. Licenses, as Brian mentioned, are continuing to decline. I think licenses in Q2 were a little less than 1% of total revenues. And for the year, maybe a little less than 1.5% is what we're looking for the rest of the year. You're seeing the results of a good healthy market, and you're seeing the results of that market continuing to embrace SaaS and the cloud.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Charles Strauzer with CJS Securities. Your line is now open.\nCharles Strauzer: Just looking at guidance for the back half of the year, is there anything abnormal that we should think about when modeling the cadence of the back half? Just anything [indiscernible] into our thinking here.\nBrian Miller: I don't think there's a whole lot at a very high level, I think you'll continue to see revenue step up a bit from where they were in the second quarter, particularly around professional services, we'll continue to see grow a bit. SaaS will continue to see growth sequentially. I think the biggest growth in the second half will be, as you'd expect, SaaS revenues continue to step up quarter-to-quarter as more new customers come online and as we execute more flips and we get the impact of those revenues. The other revenue lines, I think generally, you'll see be fairly consistent with where they were in the second quarter across the third and fourth quarters. And dropping down to the bottom line, I think you'll see earnings generally in the same range that we see in the second quarter in the third and fourth quarters. And cash flow, certainly, the third quarter historically is by far our strongest cash flow quarter because of timing of maintenance collections and that will be the case as well.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nAlex Zukin: I'm going to try to link a few threads and just throw something out there, which is it seems like your -- the flips are happening faster, they're larger. You're promoting somebody to run cloud full-time immediately. And so, I guess my question is, does it feel as though the value of that maintenance portfolio, the value of these flips given even the attach rate and the expanded portfolio of other services that you're cross-selling and the transactional revenues, is it just growing -- like if you look at the value of that pipeline, is it a lot larger than maybe what you were previously anticipating? And kind of how do you see that -- how should we think about that playing out in the P&L over the course of the next year or two?\nLynn Moore: Yes, Alex, I would say, I think in the last several quarters, we're actually starting to see a little bit more uplift than what we had expected. But I think what it does is when you step back and you look at our long-term Tyler 2030 goals, I'd say what's been happening over the last several quarters now as it's really validating what we've set out to do and what we said we're going to do. I would like to -- when you think about timing, one of the things we've constantly said is that as we look out to 2030, it won't be linear. But again, each quarter where I start to see some of these what I'm now calling momentums makes me feel even more confident about what we're doing and what we've set out to do.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Saket Kalia with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great and echo the nice results in the quarter. Brian, maybe my question is for you. I want to just talk about the payments business a little bit. I think you said mid- to high teens growth -- revenue growth in the second half, and you correct me there if I'm wrong. But is there a way that you think about kind of the payments business as sort of an equation, right, between kind of same-store sales growth plus sort of share gains? Or maybe said another way, kind of a net revenue retention in that business plus new logo. How do you think about sort of that equation, even anecdotally as part of that kind of mid- to high teens growth rate in the second half?\nBrian Miller: Yes. I think, and obviously, the change from the sort of low single-digit growth in the first half to the mid- to high teens in the second half, mostly revolves around that, the impact of us lapping the gross to net change from one of our state contracts midyear last year. But if you break down that kind of high teens growth, I think, generally, sort of the -- and it's a high level, but the sort of the same same-store growth or the same customer growth is typically kind of high-single digits, maybe approaching 10%, but kind of in that range is how we think about it. Some of that around our Digital Solutions division state contracts where they either have higher transaction volumes or we add additional services in a state that drive more revenues with that same customer. And then the difference going up into the mid- to high teens is sort of our new customer growth, and that's really reflecting the impact of driving the payments platform into our local government customer base and attaching it to both new and existing software customers. And we've talked about those being higher margin, higher premium pricing kinds of engagements. And those are the ones we're talking about. For example, this quarter that added $8 million of new ARR from new payment customers in our -- associated with our software customers. So, that's kind of generally how we think about that split.\nLynn Moore: Yes. And I think when we think -- I think we outlined when we're looking out to Tyler 2030, we looked at transaction growth. It was really -- we're projecting long-term CAGR of sort of low double-digit growth. One of the things we're also seeing, Saket, is we've gotten a lot better at onboarding our clients. We're getting a lot more efficiencies there. And so, we're actually starting to get revenues recognized sooner. And then over time, to your point about sort of same-store sales is trying to drive further and further adoption across that client base is a significant driver.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Terrell Tillman with Truist. Your line is now open.\nTerrell Tillman: I have one question and it'd almost be in two parts. So just bear with me. First, in terms of Idaho, congrats, Lynn, on the successful go-live. It sounded like four months, that's pretty strong. I'm curious though, you said this is an important milestone, I know you have some really large, on-prem or kind of private cloud customers in courts, but also maybe some that are more ready to move. How are you thinking about some of these other potential large, court flip opportunities, whether they're actionable this year or into next year? And then, Brian, just the second part of this question is, with CSI, ResourceX, ARInspect. I was intrigued last quarter because there were some big deals there. I think you said it was about a $4 million kind of quarterly run rate on those AI-based kind of solutions. Does that still hold? Or is it picking up from there?\nLynn Moore: Yes. Good question, Terry. On the Idaho SaaS flip, our courts -- there's only so many state court implementations out there. And so, getting the first one out there on time, live and referenceable was a pretty impressive feat by our people. And I'm going to make a little sidebar comment because we've talked about it before over the years. But I think one of the things that's really impressive about our teams is all the work that we do behind the scenes. We talk a lot about the numbers, but there's a lot of work that goes into getting these clients up and actionable, whether it's a SaaS flip or even just a new implementation, and our teams just did an incredible job. And as you know, this entire business is a reference business. And there were a lot of state courts who had inquired, have been asking about the SaaS flip, but they all were sort of keeping an eye on Idaho. So do I expect that to translate into other large, statewide SaaS flips or just other large court SaaS flips, I do. I'm not going to say that they're going to start happening in the month of September. But I think as you look out over the coming quarters, you'll start to see that momentum grow and build in that market?\nBrian Miller: Yes. With respect to the three acquisitions from last year that have strong AI capabilities, they continue to perform really well in terms of the new business market, and they are continuing to grow. We highlighted last quarter a couple of large deals, and I think we mentioned a few of those this time as well. I think we've been really pleased with the speed at which those have started to contribute and we're able to leverage cross-sells. Of course, that's part of the thesis behind all of those acquisitions that we can leverage our existing sales organizations in our existing customer base and new deal opportunities to sell more of those newly acquired products. And I think we've been really pleased with the speed at which we've been able to execute on those and particularly CSI adding that to some of our large court deals. ResourceX already had some large client engagements, and we're continuing to see those come on board as well in ARInspect. We called out several state deals there this quarter. So those are all performing really well and contributing nicely kind of out of the box.\nLynn Moore: Yes, there's a lot of buzz for these out in the marketplace, Terry. And as Brian said, it's kind of twofold. On the one hand, it's a great playbook that we've run for many years, a tuck-in acquisition that we can get in the hands of our sales teams and get out to our installed base but also in areas like ResourceX, for example, I mean, it's a differentiator for us in our new enterprise ERP sales. So, it's both a competitive advantage in new sales but also a huge opportunity to deploy through our installed base.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Josh Reilly with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.\nJosh Reilly: Just on the Dallas data center closure, can you just remind us in the income statement where the expenses for that data center lie? And what's the implication for our second half modeling with that shutting down? And then just secondarily, along the margin front, can you just give us some color on what drove the margin improvement in services?\nBrian Miller: I'll take the first part of it. Most of the cost for the data center are up in cost of subscriptions. So, they're up in the gross margin line, there's also -- I mean there's depreciation, there's operating costs and there's some personnel costs. Those -- the first data center that closed, the Dallas data center is a colo facility. So, there's not a real estate impact there. So those costs will be part of our margin profile in the second half of the year. But also remind you that around the second data center, which we expect to close around the end of next year, the bubble costs or the duplicate costs of running that data center and incurring costs in AWS as we migrate customers out, those costs continue to increase until they go away because we continue to move more customers out of that data center as we progress towards its closure. The impact of the closing of the first data center is somewhat offset by the ongoing impact of the second data center. And then we'll get a bigger bump at the end of -- after that data center closes in '25. So again, I think overall, I think operating margins are probably pretty consistent in the second half of the year with where they are here in Q2.\nLynn Moore: Yes, I'd say -- I'd add to that, Josh. One of the things that's gratifying to me is we outlined this vision of closing the data centers a couple of years ago, and we're basically hit it on track. And that takes a lot of work by a lot of people. And again, it continues to validate some of the things that we've outlined a couple of years ago as we started our cloud transformation. So that's gratifying to see. The other obvious upside of getting out of the Dallas data center and eventually out of the [indiscernible] data center is all the future CapEx savings. We would spend a lot of money over the next five, seven years, adding to those capabilities had we not done that. Your question on pro services gross margins, it's a couple of things. I would say, one, it's been an enhanced focus, sort of a top-down focus from the management team over the last year plus. It's something that we're dissecting and continue to dissect and look at things around really focusing on those gross margins, utilization, things like that. The other thing that's been driving it is we're starting to see a little more stability in our workforce, and we've been seeing that for several quarters. So turnover is a lot lower. And in the Pro Services area, when you experience elevated turnover, which we did coming out of COVID, we did during sort of that period post COVID when people were transferring out and going through -- the grass is always greener. It's tough because it takes a long time to get people trained, up to speed and get to a point where they can be out in the field and be billable. And so, I think it's part of what we're seeing overall in the labor market. But having that return of more stability and more consistent, historical Tyler turnover levels is certainly helping. But it's also been an enhanced focus from the management team.\nBrian Miller: I think the ongoing move to the cloud helps us there as well because in a general sense, we're able to deploy software more efficiently in the cloud. And version consolidation helps us as well to some extent there on both services and support.\nLynn Moore: And to that point, Brian, I guess, remote delivery of services, it's something we really started around COVID and clients continue to have more and more acceptance of that delivery model.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Peter Heckmann with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open.\nPeter Heckmann: Most of my questions have been answered. I just wanted to follow up on the NIC transaction and just see if you're seeing any changes in terms of those self-funded, state-level IT portal deals. If the states are looking for something different, something more and then just curious about the -- it looks like you had good renewal activity here in the first half. But do you -- I guess, what's your perception of other states migrating to that self-funded portal model in the future? Or do you think it's more likely that you do something more on an agency-by-agency basis at the state level?\nLynn Moore: Well, it's a little bit of both. Peter, the state-funded model is what old NIC now DSD grew up with. And there's -- I think there's going to be continued demand for that type of model as budgets are constrained. We talked about it, last quarter the significant deal we signed with -- last quarter, quarter before the California State Parks, which that deal could not have happened. It's the largest contract in Tyler's history, and that deal could not have happened absent the self-funded model. I do think you're going to -- we're also going to continue to see more and more agency by agency. That's part of our strategy, getting more products in on a targeted agency basis that's probably more aligned with the more historical Tyler model. We've done some things internally over the last couple of quarters really consummated in the last year. We've done an internal realignment between our Platform Solutions division and our Digital Solutions division so that we can take advantage of both of those opportunities, align our sales teams, eliminate some overlap but really start to drive both types of sales as we go forward.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nJonathan Ho: Can you give us a little bit of additional color about your thoughts around cybersecurity and what this could potentially mean in terms of either upsell opportunities or accelerated transition to the cloud? Just want to get a sense for how much this is sort of impacting the industry as a whole.\nLynn Moore: Yes, Jonathan. I mean, as we know, it's a reality. We always say it's even -- it's not a matter of if, it's when. And cybersecurity event has certainly impacted both our clients and other public sector agencies that aren't our clients. It is a natural opportunity to accelerate discussions around moving to the cloud and flipping to the cloud. We've had a number of those. We don't necessarily -- I talked about a couple of public safety that happened last quarter. I don't really like to highlight them too much. but that's -- it's a reality that's going on in the market. And one of the things that I think we're getting better at is as we're flipping clients to the cloud for whatever reason but certainly in the cyber -- as a result, cybersecurity is, it is an opportunity to get them more modern and add some more products in the mix. So again, it's out there. we're all dealing with it. And our goal really is to be as responsive to our clients as possible, and we've gotten better. I've mentioned at public safety -- we've also gotten better about being able to stand up clients really quickly, maybe not with the full functionality that they might have had in an on-premise system out of the box but enough to get them going, which also gives us an opportunity to sort of reevaluate all of their requirements and potentially upsell other items. And so yes, it's just out there.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Kirk Materne with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nKirk Materne: Yes. Congrats on the quarter. Lynn, I was wondering, on the public safety side, when customers are now flipping in a bigger way towards cloud, how does that change the competitive environment for you? Meaning, I'd imagine there are a lot of smaller competitors that don't necessarily either have the scale on the cloud side or potentially or as advanced as you all, is that leading to better, I guess, win rates in that particular segment of your business as well?\nLynn Moore: Yes. I think, Kirk, it's certainly a competitive differentiator right now. And I think we've seen this historically across different business lines. There's always times when competitors sort of make a move and then we make a move. I'd say right now, I like where we sit with public safety. We have the most comprehensive offering. We have the most comprehensive offering that can be deployed in the cloud. There are some smaller players who certainly have some cloud-native offerings but may not have the depth of functionality and may not really be good candidates for some of these larger deals and whether or not their ability to execute on it. What's been impressive, I think over the last 18 months or so -- 12, 18 months at public safety is the execution on this strategy. It's a shift in mindset for that sales team, it's a shift in mindset for all the operational teams and messaging that out to the market, it's resonating, and it's something that's exciting to see. I remember a couple of years ago talking about how it could be several years, maybe five, six years before we were even at 50% SaaS levels at public safety. And it just shows you that the changing dynamics in the market. And fortunately, we've been in a position through some of the work we've done over the years to not only capitalize on it but also help lead it.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Gabriela Borges with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nKelly Galanis: This is Kelly Galanis on for Gabriela. Congrats on the quarter as well. Given that a lot of your customers are now kind of on a new fiscal year, can you share some early observations on what customer budgets are looking like this year relative to last year? And then, how much of this stronger demand that you're seeing is tied to these healthy budgets versus kind of just demand for cloud and these other the factors you're talking about.\nLynn Moore: Yes. I don't know that -- yes, we -- for a lot of our clients are on June 30 fiscal year. But I don't know that we necessarily have significant insight in those budgets. They're pretty steady. They're pretty healthy. Most of our sales procurement cycles are multiple years long or certainly long, not all multiple years but they tend to be lengthy. I think -- I'm sorry, I lost my more train of thought there. So yes, I think the budgets are healthy right now. And I think our win rates are good. One of the things that I've -- we have noticed this year is, I think, probably a leading indicator is when you look across our product lines, all of the indicators are still strong. And really, most of our divisions, almost all of our products are either at or above sort of what their sales projection was for the year in terms of being midyear. So that's a good tailwind as we look out over the next several quarters. And right now, we're not seeing any -- certainly no negative changes in the public sector budgets.\nBrian Miller: Yes. And I think the other -- the other side of that strong demand is this increasing desire for digital modernization, and it's really how governments increasingly do -- address doing more with less resources. So, to the extent that they have really struggling with understaffing, a lot of workers left the public sector space during COVID and in general, government has not rebuilt its workforce. So, they're trying to perform these essential services with staffing constraints and really turning to technology as how they do that. So I think it's a little bit even more than just the traditional replacing a 20-year-old system that's at end of life and is dying but being more strategic about it and saying, okay, the new technology will help me do the things I have to do with either the budget or the personnel constraints that I'm forced to deal with.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Mark Schappel with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMark Schappel: Nice job on the quarter. John, question for you in your prepared remarks, you noted continued progress you're making around your product version consolidation efforts. Just wondering if you could elaborate on the progress you made during the quarter on that front and also what we can expect maybe in the coming quarters here.\nJohn Marr: Yes, sure, Mark, obviously, version consolidation has been a big part of what I've been calling sort of Phase 1 of our cloud transformation. Phase 1 is selecting AWS. It's a product optimization, it's version consolidation. It's the flips, it's exiting the data centers. Version consolidation is critical for a lot of reasons. One is we need to get down to a single product. We need to get down to a cloud release. We need to get our clients up-to-date on the modern versions. Otherwise, they're not really going to be flipping the cloud. That's part of the foundation for that. We don't really go I don't know that you see necessarily quarter-by-quarter progress, but you see goals that are being hit and attained. Anecdotally, for example, in our enterprise ERP division, which is formerly our munis product we now have about 95% of our clients down on a single version, whereas a couple of years ago, there were several versions with maybe hundreds of clients on different types of versions. So that's significant progress that's been made, and it's a focus across all of our divisions and all of our operating units, and they're making similar progress.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. There are no additional questions waiting at this time. So, I'll pass the call back to Lynn Moore for any closing remarks.\nLynn Moore: Thanks, Matt. And thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thanks, Lynn. Total revenues for the quarter were $541 million, up 7.3% and organically grew 6.5%. Subscriptions revenue increased 12.1% and organically rose 11.8%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew 23.2% to $156 million and grew organically 22.5%. Keep in mind that there's often a lag from the signing of a new SaaS flip or SaaS deal or flip to the start of revenue recognition that can vary from one to several quarters. Because of this, as well as the timing of SaaS renewals and related price increases, SaaS revenue growth both year-over-year and sequentially may fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Transaction revenues grew 3.8% to $177.7 million. Transaction revenues exceeded our plan, primarily due to higher transaction volumes from new and existing clients, including recreational licenses such as hunting and fishing, which begin their peak season during Q2. In addition, e-filing revenues grew 11.2%. The year-over-year comparison for transaction revenues continued to be impacted by the change in mid-2023 from the gross model to the net model for payments under one of our state enterprise agreements. This will no longer be a factor in year-over-year growth comparisons in the second half of the year, and our expectation is for mid- to high teens growth in transaction revenues in the second half of 2024. SaaS deals comprised approximately 97% of our Q2 new software contract value compared to 82% last year. During the quarter, we added 203 new SaaS arrangements and converted 111 existing on-premises clients to SaaS with a total contract value of approximately $127 million. In Q2 of last year, we added 170 new SaaS arrangements and had 94 on-premises conversions with total contract value of approximately $93 million. More importantly, the average ARR associated with our Q2 flips increased 21.8% over last year as larger clients such as Fulton and Clayton Counties in in Metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia; the cities of Tucson, Arizona and Birmingham, Alabama; and the Columbus, Ohio City schools flipped to the cloud, including transaction revenues, expansions with existing clients and professional services, total bookings increased 7.3% on an organic basis. Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.8 billion, up 8.4% and organically grew 7.8%. In previous quarters, we discussed our expectation that 2023 would be the operating margin trough from our cloud transition and that 2024 would mark a return to operating margin expansion. Our non-GAAP operating margin in the second quarter was 24.5%, up 150 basis points from last year. The margin expansion reflects improved margins from our cloud operations, along with expensive effective operating expense management and improving professional services margins. As we discussed on previous calls, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model have a meaningful impact on our overall margins as they are passed through to clients and are included in both revenues and cost of revenues. We incurred merchant fees of approximately $45 million in Q2. Because of strong earnings and effective working capital management, both cash flows from operations and free cash flow were above expectations for the quarter at $64.3 million and $48.6 million, respectively. Cash flow in the quarter was impacted by approximately $29 million of incremental cash taxes due to Section 174. We ended the quarter with $600 million of convertible debt outstanding and cash and investments of approximately $262 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 0.65x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA. Our updated 2024 annual guidance is as follows: We expect total revenues will be between $2.120 billion and $2.150 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 9%. We expect that merchant fees will be up approximately 6% over last year, and then implied organic growth, excluding merchant fees, would be approximately 20 basis points higher. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.76 and $5.96 and may vary significantly due to the impact of discrete tax items on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $9.25 and $9.45. We expect our free cash flow margin will be between 18% and 20%, including an estimated impact of approximately $60 million of incremental cash taxes related to Section 174. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q2 earnings deck posted on our website. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn. Those two are related, but they're not related to any reclassification of R&D. They're just interrelated in terms of as we perform different R&D projects. Some of them fall in the category of requiring capitalization and others are expensed. And sometimes, there's a -- and this just reflects a little bit of a shift between those two. So more of our development costs are being expensed and less being -- I'm sorry, more being capitalized and less are being expensed to R&D. So, it's just a shift between capitalization and expense based on the nature of the projects. Yes. I don't think there's anything particularly seasonal around the pace of those, both the timing of new deals and especially the timing of flips can be a little bit lumpy. So, we certainly expect the trend to continue to be over the mid- and long term for the number of flips and the size of flips to continue to increase. That was one of the big factors this quarter was that the average ARR from flips this quarter was up almost 20%, and we highlighted some of those larger flips that are taking place. But I think in general, obviously, we're at a very high percentage of SaaS at 97% of the new business. I think public safety still will have some license deals in the second half of the year. And so that may even fall back a little bit. But the trend that Lynn just described is certainly continuing of greater acceptance of SaaS and public safety. So, I think you'll continue to see the flips trend upward, although they may bounce around a little bit from quarter to quarter and that the continuing -- the vast majority of our new deals coming in and SaaS will also continue. I don't think there's a whole lot at a very high level, I think you'll continue to see revenue step up a bit from where they were in the second quarter, particularly around professional services, we'll continue to see grow a bit. SaaS will continue to see growth sequentially. I think the biggest growth in the second half will be, as you'd expect, SaaS revenues continue to step up quarter-to-quarter as more new customers come online and as we execute more flips and we get the impact of those revenues. The other revenue lines, I think generally, you'll see be fairly consistent with where they were in the second quarter across the third and fourth quarters. And dropping down to the bottom line, I think you'll see earnings generally in the same range that we see in the second quarter in the third and fourth quarters. And cash flow, certainly, the third quarter historically is by far our strongest cash flow quarter because of timing of maintenance collections and that will be the case as well. Yes. I think, and obviously, the change from the sort of low single-digit growth in the first half to the mid- to high teens in the second half, mostly revolves around that, the impact of us lapping the gross to net change from one of our state contracts midyear last year. But if you break down that kind of high teens growth, I think, generally, sort of the -- and it's a high level, but the sort of the same same-store growth or the same customer growth is typically kind of high-single digits, maybe approaching 10%, but kind of in that range is how we think about it. Some of that around our Digital Solutions division state contracts where they either have higher transaction volumes or we add additional services in a state that drive more revenues with that same customer. And then the difference going up into the mid- to high teens is sort of our new customer growth, and that's really reflecting the impact of driving the payments platform into our local government customer base and attaching it to both new and existing software customers. And we've talked about those being higher margin, higher premium pricing kinds of engagements. And those are the ones we're talking about. For example, this quarter that added $8 million of new ARR from new payment customers in our -- associated with our software customers. So, that's kind of generally how we think about that split. Yes. With respect to the three acquisitions from last year that have strong AI capabilities, they continue to perform really well in terms of the new business market, and they are continuing to grow. We highlighted last quarter a couple of large deals, and I think we mentioned a few of those this time as well. I think we've been really pleased with the speed at which those have started to contribute and we're able to leverage cross-sells. Of course, that's part of the thesis behind all of those acquisitions that we can leverage our existing sales organizations in our existing customer base and new deal opportunities to sell more of those newly acquired products. And I think we've been really pleased with the speed at which we've been able to execute on those and particularly CSI adding that to some of our large court deals. ResourceX already had some large client engagements, and we're continuing to see those come on board as well in ARInspect. We called out several state deals there this quarter. So those are all performing really well and contributing nicely kind of out of the box. I'll take the first part of it. Most of the cost for the data center are up in cost of subscriptions. So, they're up in the gross margin line, there's also -- I mean there's depreciation, there's operating costs and there's some personnel costs. Those -- the first data center that closed, the Dallas data center is a colo facility. So, there's not a real estate impact there. So those costs will be part of our margin profile in the second half of the year. But also remind you that around the second data center, which we expect to close around the end of next year, the bubble costs or the duplicate costs of running that data center and incurring costs in AWS as we migrate customers out, those costs continue to increase until they go away because we continue to move more customers out of that data center as we progress towards its closure. The impact of the closing of the first data center is somewhat offset by the ongoing impact of the second data center. And then we'll get a bigger bump at the end of -- after that data center closes in '25. So again, I think overall, I think operating margins are probably pretty consistent in the second half of the year with where they are here in Q2. I think the ongoing move to the cloud helps us there as well because in a general sense, we're able to deploy software more efficiently in the cloud. And version consolidation helps us as well to some extent there on both services and support. Yes. And I think the other -- the other side of that strong demand is this increasing desire for digital modernization, and it's really how governments increasingly do -- address doing more with less resources. So, to the extent that they have really struggling with understaffing, a lot of workers left the public sector space during COVID and in general, government has not rebuilt its workforce. So, they're trying to perform these essential services with staffing constraints and really turning to technology as how they do that. So I think it's a little bit even more than just the traditional replacing a 20-year-old system that's at end of life and is dying but being more strategic about it and saying, okay, the new technology will help me do the things I have to do with either the budget or the personnel constraints that I'm forced to deal with."

            "content": "Yes, sure, Mark, obviously, version consolidation has been a big part of what I've been calling sort of Phase 1 of our cloud transformation. Phase 1 is selecting AWS. It's a product optimization, it's version consolidation. It's the flips, it's exiting the data centers. Version consolidation is critical for a lot of reasons. One is we need to get down to a single product. We need to get down to a cloud release. We need to get our clients up-to-date on the modern versions. Otherwise, they're not really going to be flipping the cloud. That's part of the foundation for that. We don't really go I don't know that you see necessarily quarter-by-quarter progress, but you see goals that are being hit and attained. Anecdotally, for example, in our enterprise ERP division, which is formerly our munis product we now have about 95% of our clients down on a single version, whereas a couple of years ago, there were several versions with maybe hundreds of clients on different types of versions. So that's significant progress that's been made, and it's a focus across all of our divisions and all of our operating units, and they're making similar progress."

            "name": "Lynn Moore",
            "content": "Thanks, Hala. We built on the momentum from our strong first quarter performance to, again, deliver exceptional second quarter results marked by consistently high execution and a continuation of solid operating and financial performance. Each of our key metrics across revenues, earnings, operating margin and cash flow exceeded our expectations. These results are especially meaningful given the significant shift towards SaaS in our new software contract mix, which pressured revenues and margins. Recurring revenues grew 8.4% and comprised 83% of our total revenues. SaaS revenues grew 23.2%, our 14th consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more above our target of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025. In addition, transaction revenues were ahead of plan driven by higher transaction volumes, including an increase in e-filing volumes and expanded payment services. Since committing to our cloud-first strategy in 2019, we've been intently focused on supporting our public sector's clients' digital transformation and guiding their migration to Tyler's next-generation cloud applications. Last year, we reached an inflection point where valuable, long-term recurring SaaS revenues surpassed on-premises' license and maintenance revenues. We're pleased to reach another milestone as we have now essentially completed the exit of our Dallas data center. This move is a significant achievement in our cloud migration road map as we continue to scale our deployments at AWS and drive more durable growth and margin benefits from our SaaS-based operating model. The public sector market remains healthy, characterized by high levels of RFP and sales demo activity. Our new business pipeline remains at elevated levels, reflecting the robust market environment, growing cross-sell opportunities and continued strong execution by our sales organization. Our leading market position and competitive strengths, including our deep domain expertise continue to differentiate us in the marketplace. These strengths underpin our long-term strategic focus on four key growth drivers, leveraging our unmatched installed base, expanding into new markets, completing our cloud transition and growing our payments business. Our large client base represents one of our most significant assets, and we're pleased to see strong go-to-market execution with significant cross-sell and upsell wins during the quarter, which included a joint effort with our Justice Group, leveraging our Digital Solution division's strong relationships in Florida, for an agreement with the Florida Department of Corrections to manage all aspects of money transfer services for correctional facilities across the state. The contract brings together disbursement solutions from our Rapid Financial Solutions acquisition, inmate trust and accounting and e-communications from the VendEngine acquisitions and payments through our Digital Solutions division. A single sourced enterprise supervision and enterprise public safety contract with Cherokee Nation, Oklahoma, adding to its existing enterprise ERP solutions. The SaaS agreement was a joint collaborative sales effort resulting in a total Tyler client win. Additionally, we continue to innovate and elevate our clients' resident engagement experience by empowering citizens with direct connections to government through Tyler's MyCivic platform. In Mississippi, we expanded citizen access to mental health resources with the Mississippi State Department of Health, leveraging our state enterprise agreement. We continue to advance our cloud transition and make substantial progress with our product version consolidation efforts, which will accelerate our continued migration of on-premises clients to the cloud. We're also pleased with the numerous second quarter SaaS contract wins, which underscore the public sector market's recognition of cloud benefits, including enhanced security. One of the key themes that emerged during client interactions at our recent Connect 2024 user conference was a notable shift in client openness to embrace cloud technology and a growing expectation among on-premises clients that they will migrate to the cloud. This shift is especially apparent in the state and federal market with our application platform and in the public safety market, where 90% of second quarter public safety contract value was SaaS compared to 13% a year ago. Primarily as a result of this accelerated shift in public safety cloud adoption, SaaS arrangements comprised 97% of our new software contract value in the second quarter. Additionally, we signed 111 flips of on-premises clients, including a number of larger clients, with the average ARR flips growing 21.8%. We also had a very successful go-live in May with the SaaS migration of the Idaho State Court system. This is our first flip to the cloud of a statewide court system, and Idaho went live just four months after the project kicked off. This high-profile migration has been watched closely by other statewide and large county courts and its successful execution is certainly a positive reference point as we engage with other large core clients about moving to the cloud. Key second quarter new SaaS deals and flips included a competitive win with the City of Topeka, Kansas for multiple integrated solutions, including enterprise ERP, enterprise permitting & licensing, enterprise asset management for nearly $700,000 in ARR. And ERP Pro and Payments contract with Richland County, Wisconsin, funded via ARPA funds. That was executed on an accelerated 90-day sales cycle, leveraging our enhanced sales enablement and competitive intel teams. The Idaho State Police signed a SaaS contract for our integrated enterprise public safety suite including CAD, records management and e-citations. This Tier 1 competitive win demonstrates our growing momentum with state public safety agencies and represents the sixth state police agency to adopt our enterprise public safety solutions. The United County, New York Department of Emergency Services also chose our integrated Public Safety Suite for 64 agency client-driven, SaaS deployment. Hunt County, Texas, upgraded to Enterprise Public Safety from our Public Safety Pro solution and Spotsylvania County, Virginia, signed a contract for our enforcement Mobile Solutions, joining eight of the 14 largest Virginia agencies using Tyler Public Safety applications. We signed an enterprise justice SaaS flip with Fulton County, Georgia, which includes Atlanta. The contract with ARR of $1.9 million follows Fulton County's Enterprise appraisal and tax SaaS flip signed in the first quarter, and includes integrated justice solutions such as prosecutor and jail as well as additional client management services under our unified One Tyler approach. We also signed an enterprise supervision expansion with the Arizona Supreme Court that builds on the success of adult probation to add juvenile probation for all 15 counties across the state. We leveraged the state relationship, which led to a five-year enterprise justice agreement with the Phoenix Municipal Court, representing in excess of $2.25 million in ARR. This strategic and highly competitive win includes five one-year extension options and paves the way for expansion and new court software opportunities in a large population state. Another theme coming out of Connect '24 was pronounced interest in AI and our expanded AI capabilities that were added through our 2023 acquisitions. High interest is turning into multiple new deals and cross-sell wins for our application platform, leveraging our augmented field operation solutions, formerly ARInspect with four inspection SaaS arrangements in the quarter across state, environmental, health and regulatory agencies. These included the California State Board of Pharmacy to configure and automate five regulatory inspection types, the Kentucky Department Environmental Protection, the New York Department of Health and the Arkansas Department of Labor and Licensing, which was a cross-sell win leveraging our Digital Solutions division state enterprise relationship. Another key to our growth strategy is expanding our differentiated payments business. And similar to our first quarter results, higher transaction volumes contributed to better-than-expected transaction revenues. In the second quarter, we signed 195 new payments deals across Tyler Software clients, representing approximately $8 million in projected ARR. In our state enterprise portal business, we secured extensions for our digital government and payment processing services under four state enterprise contracts, including Hawaii, New Jersey, Kansas and Kentucky and also won a sole source award with the state of Rhode Island as no extensions remained under the previous contract. We also signed a two-year renewal with the state of Illinois for our Outdoor and Enterprise Licensing Solutions. Now I'd like Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our updated annual guidance for 2024. Thanks, Brian. Our exceptional performance in the first half of 2024 positions us well for a strong second half. We're pleased with our progress across all fronts as we remain on track with key initiatives around our four-pronged growth strategy while demonstrating our competitive strength and model durability. Our cloud transition is beginning to generate the expected benefits of margin improvement and enhanced client experience. As you know, in 2019, we launched a multiyear cloud strategy to shift our solutions and operations to a cloud-first business model, leading our clients to a future in the cloud. As we enter the next phase of our cloud journey, and as more new and existing clients embrace our cloud strategy, we see increasing opportunities to prove areas critical to our clients that ultimately affect client satisfaction, including product release cycles, product consistency, performance reliability and cost effectiveness. To effectively address these areas and lead this change, I'm pleased to share that Russell Gainford has been promoted to Chief Cloud Officer, effective immediately. Over the past three years, Russell has proven his ability to own the overall vision for Tyler's cloud-first strategy. And in his new capacity, he will continue to drive our cloud initiatives across our organization, including developing our cloud technology and operation standards, controls and business processes, overseeing our strategic business partner and vendor relationships as well as architecting the organizational design and staffing plans in collaboration with operational leaders. Shifting to capital allocation. Our disciplined approach bolsters our strong balance sheet as we've repaid our term debt during this period of higher interest rates. This coupled with our ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow provides tremendous flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to make investments that drive shareholder value, including product development, M&A and potentially stock buybacks. And while the bar is currently high for acquisitions, we continue to evaluate strategic tuck-in acquisitions, while building liquidity to be in a position to address our convertible debt maturity in March of '26. I'm also pleased to highlight that Tyler recently was recognized by two leading publications as we were included on Times list of America's best midsized companies and Forbes' Best Employers for Women's list. Before I close, I'd like to welcome our two new board members, Margot Carter and Andy Teed, who were elected at our May 9th Annual Meeting. Margot brings a wealth of experience in cloud software and SaaS transformations, AI and payments. She currently serves as President of Living Mountain Capital, where she invests in and advises companies and private equity firms on digital transformation and innovative strategies. She has an extensive background in finance M&A and corporate governance and has served on several public company boards. Andy is a seasoned technology executive with significant public sector experience. He currently serves as the CEO of Eco Parking Technologies, an integrated lighting and parking guidance company. Prior to that, Andy spent nearly 20 years at Tyler in various senior leadership roles. His extensive public sector experience and familiarity with our products and clients along with his knowledge of cloud technologies, make Andy a valuable addition to our Board. I also want to thank our two outgoing Board Directors, Dusty Womble and [Mary Landro] for their years of service and contributions to Tyler's success. Finally, I'd like to express my appreciation to our entire Tyler team for their hard work and continued commitment to driving growth while leading our clients on their digital modernization journeys. Our leadership is aligned with a unified focus on cloud living, and I've never been more confident in our prospects and Tyler's future. Now, we'd like to open the line for Q&A. Yes, Alex, I think it's a couple of things. We did sign that long-term extension as we continue to commit more and more of our clients going into AWS and more and more spend each year, we do receive some additional discounts. So, I would expect those to continue. I think the other side is just -- is really just some of the operational efficiencies that we're starting to see the product optimization as we continue to optimize and move them into AWS version consolidation, the things that we've talked about. So, it's a number of factors, but I do expect looking forward that some of our gross margins would improve. I don't know that I would look -- I think as you look out over the next six, seven years, our Tyler 2030 vision, I would expect several of our gross margin lines to improve. I don't know that necessarily it's going to happen in the next 12 months, but we are making progress on all of those items. Yes, Matt, it's a good point. We are seeing more momentum, certainly more cross-sell momentum in that state space. I think it's a testament to our DSD division's long-standing relationships and really our enhanced focus on leveraging those these last couple of years. There's things that we've done. We've talked about in the last couple of earnings calls around compensation and sales commissions and also executive leadership compensation that sort of try to break down some of those barriers and enhance those cross-sell opportunities. We are seeing more and more multiproduct deals. I think I referenced a few in my notes earlier. And that again, that's just -- it's a testament to what we've been -- what I've been sort of calling for the last couple of years, this vision of one Tyler operating more as a singular unified company, breaking down any sort of internal barriers that might have been just a slight hindrance in the past around cross sells and upsells. And I think we're starting to see that pay off as relationships are continuing to forge and as they start to become more and more productive. Yes, you're right, Rob. Public safety has -- it's actually been a little bit surprising their results this year. At the end of last year and really coming into this year, we had made the decision that we were going to really lead our clients to the cloud sort of like the position we took across all of Tyler. And you're right, the momentum is there. Momentum is an interesting thing. And as you know, our clients talk and so I think right now, it is a competitive advantage for us. We are able to offer all of our core public safety products in a SaaS environment. That's not necessarily the case with all of our competitors. It's still a very competitive market. I like where we sit right now. I like some of our key wins or against some really key Tier 1 competitors, some that I mentioned in my remarks earlier, like Idaho State police deal. So, it's an interesting dynamic and one that I think is -- I talked earlier about momentum it is building momentum, and it's exciting to see. And I think we're also starting to see the impact of some of the cybersecurity concerns, which are -- they're heightened across all of our clients, but we've seen a number of flips. I think we had six flips in public safety in Q2. A couple of those were actually the result of some ransomware. And so being able to be nimble and stand up those clients very quickly, perhaps not with full functionality, but get them up and running where they can do their job has actually shown a lot of benefits and starting to give confidence to our clients and to their surrounding communities that the cloud is something that they should be looking at. Yes. I think, Michael, too, I think when you look at the numbers and compare quarter-over-quarter from last year, we've talked about the public sector market and how budgets are healthy and sales pipeline is strong. I think you're seeing that. We had I think if you look at our total new software deals, it's up about 11% year-over-year. Our flips are actually up about 18% and our new SaaS deals were up about 20%. Licenses, as Brian mentioned, are continuing to decline. I think licenses in Q2 were a little less than 1% of total revenues. And for the year, maybe a little less than 1.5% is what we're looking for the rest of the year. You're seeing the results of a good healthy market, and you're seeing the results of that market continuing to embrace SaaS and the cloud. Yes, Alex, I would say, I think in the last several quarters, we're actually starting to see a little bit more uplift than what we had expected. But I think what it does is when you step back and you look at our long-term Tyler 2030 goals, I'd say what's been happening over the last several quarters now as it's really validating what we've set out to do and what we said we're going to do. I would like to -- when you think about timing, one of the things we've constantly said is that as we look out to 2030, it won't be linear. But again, each quarter where I start to see some of these what I'm now calling momentums makes me feel even more confident about what we're doing and what we've set out to do. Yes. And I think when we think -- I think we outlined when we're looking out to Tyler 2030, we looked at transaction growth. It was really -- we're projecting long-term CAGR of sort of low double-digit growth. One of the things we're also seeing, Saket, is we've gotten a lot better at onboarding our clients. We're getting a lot more efficiencies there. And so, we're actually starting to get revenues recognized sooner. And then over time, to your point about sort of same-store sales is trying to drive further and further adoption across that client base is a significant driver. Yes. Good question, Terry. On the Idaho SaaS flip, our courts -- there's only so many state court implementations out there. And so, getting the first one out there on time, live and referenceable was a pretty impressive feat by our people. And I'm going to make a little sidebar comment because we've talked about it before over the years. But I think one of the things that's really impressive about our teams is all the work that we do behind the scenes. We talk a lot about the numbers, but there's a lot of work that goes into getting these clients up and actionable, whether it's a SaaS flip or even just a new implementation, and our teams just did an incredible job. And as you know, this entire business is a reference business. And there were a lot of state courts who had inquired, have been asking about the SaaS flip, but they all were sort of keeping an eye on Idaho. So do I expect that to translate into other large, statewide SaaS flips or just other large court SaaS flips, I do. I'm not going to say that they're going to start happening in the month of September. But I think as you look out over the coming quarters, you'll start to see that momentum grow and build in that market? Yes, there's a lot of buzz for these out in the marketplace, Terry. And as Brian said, it's kind of twofold. On the one hand, it's a great playbook that we've run for many years, a tuck-in acquisition that we can get in the hands of our sales teams and get out to our installed base but also in areas like ResourceX, for example, I mean, it's a differentiator for us in our new enterprise ERP sales. So, it's both a competitive advantage in new sales but also a huge opportunity to deploy through our installed base. Yes, I'd say -- I'd add to that, Josh. One of the things that's gratifying to me is we outlined this vision of closing the data centers a couple of years ago, and we're basically hit it on track. And that takes a lot of work by a lot of people. And again, it continues to validate some of the things that we've outlined a couple of years ago as we started our cloud transformation. So that's gratifying to see. The other obvious upside of getting out of the Dallas data center and eventually out of the [indiscernible] data center is all the future CapEx savings. We would spend a lot of money over the next five, seven years, adding to those capabilities had we not done that. Your question on pro services gross margins, it's a couple of things. I would say, one, it's been an enhanced focus, sort of a top-down focus from the management team over the last year plus. It's something that we're dissecting and continue to dissect and look at things around really focusing on those gross margins, utilization, things like that. The other thing that's been driving it is we're starting to see a little more stability in our workforce, and we've been seeing that for several quarters. So turnover is a lot lower. And in the Pro Services area, when you experience elevated turnover, which we did coming out of COVID, we did during sort of that period post COVID when people were transferring out and going through -- the grass is always greener. It's tough because it takes a long time to get people trained, up to speed and get to a point where they can be out in the field and be billable. And so, I think it's part of what we're seeing overall in the labor market. But having that return of more stability and more consistent, historical Tyler turnover levels is certainly helping. But it's also been an enhanced focus from the management team. And to that point, Brian, I guess, remote delivery of services, it's something we really started around COVID and clients continue to have more and more acceptance of that delivery model. Well, it's a little bit of both. Peter, the state-funded model is what old NIC now DSD grew up with. And there's -- I think there's going to be continued demand for that type of model as budgets are constrained. We talked about it, last quarter the significant deal we signed with -- last quarter, quarter before the California State Parks, which that deal could not have happened. It's the largest contract in Tyler's history, and that deal could not have happened absent the self-funded model. I do think you're going to -- we're also going to continue to see more and more agency by agency. That's part of our strategy, getting more products in on a targeted agency basis that's probably more aligned with the more historical Tyler model. We've done some things internally over the last couple of quarters really consummated in the last year. We've done an internal realignment between our Platform Solutions division and our Digital Solutions division so that we can take advantage of both of those opportunities, align our sales teams, eliminate some overlap but really start to drive both types of sales as we go forward. Yes, Jonathan. I mean, as we know, it's a reality. We always say it's even -- it's not a matter of if, it's when. And cybersecurity event has certainly impacted both our clients and other public sector agencies that aren't our clients. It is a natural opportunity to accelerate discussions around moving to the cloud and flipping to the cloud. We've had a number of those. We don't necessarily -- I talked about a couple of public safety that happened last quarter. I don't really like to highlight them too much. but that's -- it's a reality that's going on in the market. And one of the things that I think we're getting better at is as we're flipping clients to the cloud for whatever reason but certainly in the cyber -- as a result, cybersecurity is, it is an opportunity to get them more modern and add some more products in the mix. So again, it's out there. we're all dealing with it. And our goal really is to be as responsive to our clients as possible, and we've gotten better. I've mentioned at public safety -- we've also gotten better about being able to stand up clients really quickly, maybe not with the full functionality that they might have had in an on-premise system out of the box but enough to get them going, which also gives us an opportunity to sort of reevaluate all of their requirements and potentially upsell other items. And so yes, it's just out there. Yes. I think, Kirk, it's certainly a competitive differentiator right now. And I think we've seen this historically across different business lines. There's always times when competitors sort of make a move and then we make a move. I'd say right now, I like where we sit with public safety. We have the most comprehensive offering. We have the most comprehensive offering that can be deployed in the cloud. There are some smaller players who certainly have some cloud-native offerings but may not have the depth of functionality and may not really be good candidates for some of these larger deals and whether or not their ability to execute on it. What's been impressive, I think over the last 18 months or so -- 12, 18 months at public safety is the execution on this strategy. It's a shift in mindset for that sales team, it's a shift in mindset for all the operational teams and messaging that out to the market, it's resonating, and it's something that's exciting to see. I remember a couple of years ago talking about how it could be several years, maybe five, six years before we were even at 50% SaaS levels at public safety. And it just shows you that the changing dynamics in the market. And fortunately, we've been in a position through some of the work we've done over the years to not only capitalize on it but also help lead it. Yes. I don't know that -- yes, we -- for a lot of our clients are on June 30 fiscal year. But I don't know that we necessarily have significant insight in those budgets. They're pretty steady. They're pretty healthy. Most of our sales procurement cycles are multiple years long or certainly long, not all multiple years but they tend to be lengthy. I think -- I'm sorry, I lost my more train of thought there. So yes, I think the budgets are healthy right now. And I think our win rates are good. One of the things that I've -- we have noticed this year is, I think, probably a leading indicator is when you look across our product lines, all of the indicators are still strong. And really, most of our divisions, almost all of our products are either at or above sort of what their sales projection was for the year in terms of being midyear. So that's a good tailwind as we look out over the next several quarters. And right now, we're not seeing any -- certainly no negative changes in the public sector budgets. Thanks, Matt. And thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to today's Tyler Technologies First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Lynn Moore, President and Chief Executive Officer of Tyler Technologies. [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, April 25, 2024. \n I would like to turn the call over to Hala Elsherbini, Tyler's Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nHala Elsherbini: Thank you, Christa, and welcome to our call. With me today is Lynn Moore, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. After I give the safe harbor statement, Lynn will have some initial comments on our quarter and then Brian will review the details of our results and update our annual guidance for 2024. Lynn will end with some additional comments, and then we'll take your questions.  \n During this conference call, management may make statements that provide information other than historical information and may include projections concerning the company's future prospects, revenues, expenses and profits. Such statements are considered forward-looking statements under the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projections. We would refer you to our Form 10-K and other SEC filings for more information on those risks. Also, in our earnings release, we have included non-GAAP measures that we believe facilitate understanding of our results and comparisons with peers in the software industry.  \n A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is provided in our earnings release. We have also posted on the Investor Relations section of our website under the Financials tab, schedules with supplemental information, including information about our quarterly recurring revenues and bookings. On the Events and Presentations tab, we posted an earnings summary slide deck to supplement our prepared remarks. Please note that all growth comparisons we make on the call today will relate to the corresponding period of last year unless we specify otherwise. Lynn? \nH. Moore: Thanks, Hala. Our first quarter results provided an exceptional start to the year, exceeding our expectations across key metrics, including revenues, earnings, operating margin and cash flow. Recurring revenues grew almost 9% and comprised 84% of our total revenues. SaaS revenues grew 22%, our 13th consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more, exceeding expectations of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025. In addition, transaction revenue surpassed our plan with higher volumes and positive pricing trends.  \n Our performance demonstrates the power of our business model against the backdrop of robust public sector demand, supported by generally healthy budgets. Our leading sales activity indicators remain elevated, and our pipeline reflects growing sales synergies as we execute our integrated go-to-market strategy.  \n During our Investor Day last year, we announced our Tyler 2030 Vision, which aligns our strategic focus on 4 key growth drivers: leveraging our installed base, expanding into new markets, completing our cloud transition, and growing our payments business.  \n Leveraging our unmatched installed base has been a cornerstone of our growth strategy, and we're pleased with the outstanding execution by our sales organization, driving impactful cross-sell and upsell activity that further deepens existing client relationships and expands our market reach with new client engagements. Notable cross-sell and upsell wins during the quarter included a records management and ERP pro contract, including payments with Ada County, Idaho, leveraging our state enterprise relationship. And on-premises contract, for our full enterprise Public Safety suite with the City of Columbus, Georgia, adding to its existing Tyler courts, corrections, ERP, tax and permitting solutions.  \n An enterprise ERP win with the Texas Legislative Council facilitated by our existing Digital Solutions division relationship in Texas, which avoided an RFP process to secure a new enterprise ERP client in a nontraditional market. A combined SaaS contract with the city of Juneau, Alaska, for enterprise assessment and tax and enterprise permitting and licensing solutions. By prioritizing the cloud as one of our key growth drivers, we are unlocking new levels of innovation and responsiveness in making the cloud accessible for our clients, while providing enhanced security. Our new software SaaS mix continue to expand and comprised 93% of Q1 new software contract value. \n We're particularly encouraged to see a growing preference for cloud technology in the state and federal market with our application platform and an accelerated shift in Public Safety cloud demand with multiple client-driven SaaS selections. In fact, 75% of our first quarter enterprise Public Safety deals were SaaS. Because the pace of the shift to SaaS in these markets this year is faster than we previously anticipated, we have lowered our expectations for license revenues for the year. And across Tyler, the volume of flip signed in the first quarter was in line with our expectations, with a 21.5% increase in average ARR.  \n Key first quarter new SaaS deals and flips included multiyear SaaS arrangements with the Hawaii Department of Natural Resources and land between the Lakes National Recreation area that build on our momentum in the outdoor recreation space. Competitive SaaS wins for Public Safety included a full enterprise Public Safety suite contract with Palm Beach, Florida, which was focused on a cloud-only strategy. We also won a sole-source enterprise Public Safety contract with the city of Evanston, Illinois, which expands our growing footprint in the Chicagoland area. An enterprise appraisal in tax for Fulton County, Georgia, which includes Atlanta. The contracts with ARR of more than $1 million was executed on accelerated timeline with a go-live completed within 1 month. Two Public Safety SaaS flips with Beringham, Alabama and Germantown, Tennessee, both of which were client-driven SaaS selections and accelerated go-lives. The Kansas judicial branch signed an enterprise justice appellate court SaaS flip as we continue to see a growing interest in moving to the cloud from our on-premises courts clients.  \n Another key driver of our long-term growth is our transactions and payments business. As I mentioned earlier, better-than-expected transaction volumes contributed to first quarter revenues that exceeded our expectations. In the first quarter, we signed 288 new payments deals across Tyler, representing approximately $9 million in projected ARR. In our state enterprise portal business, we signed a new 3-year enterprise contract with the State of Mississippi, extending our existing 14-year relationship. Our enterprise agreement with the State of Idaho was also renewed for 2 years in a rebid through the NASPO Citizen Engagement agreement.  \n We're also very pleased to see early traction and growing demand for the solutions we added to our portfolio through our 2023 acquisitions of CSI, ARInspect and RexourceX, each of which brought us expanded AI capabilities. With CSI, we signed a contract with our existing course client in Dallas County, Texas, adding approximately $900,000 of ARR. We've seen demo activity double over pre-acquisition levels for our augmented field operation solution, formerly ARInspect, with first quarter wins that included the city of Newark manhole inspections and an expansion contract with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.  \n For our priority-based budgeting solution powered by RexourceX, we signed contracts with Collier County, Florida and Fort Worth, Texas that added almost $600,000 of ARR.  \n Now I'd like Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our updated annual guidance for 2024. \nBrian Miller: Lynn, total revenues for the quarter were $512.4 million, up 8.6% and organically grew to 7.8%. Subscriptions revenue increased 11.7% and organically rose 11.4%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew 22% to $148.8 million and grew organically 21.3%. Keep in mind that there's often a lag from the signing of a new SaaS deal or a flip to the start of revenue recognition that can vary from one to several quarters. Because of this, as well as the timing of SaaS renewals and related price increases, SaaS revenue growth, both year-over-year and sequentially may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.  \n Transaction revenues grew 3.7% to $164.5 million. While transaction revenues exceeded our plan, primarily due to higher transaction volumes from new and existing clients, including driver history records, the year-over-year comparison continues to be impacted by the change last year from the gross model to the net model for payments under one of our state enterprise agreement. SaaS deals comprised approximately 93% of our Q1 new software contract value compared to 87% last year.  \n During the quarter, we added 200 new SaaS arrangements and converted 90 existing on-premises SaaS clients -- on-premises clients to SaaS with a total contract value of approximately $86 million. In Q1 of last year, we added 145 new SaaS arrangements and had 73 on-premises conversions with a total contract value of approximately $86 million. More importantly, the average ARR associated with our Q1 flips increased 21.5% over last year. Including transaction revenues, expansions with existing clients and professional services, total bookings increased 15.7% on an organic basis.  \n Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.72 billion, up 8.8% and organically grew 8.2%. In previous quarters, we discussed our expectation that 2023 would be the operating margin trough from our cloud transition and that 2024 would mark a return to operating margin expansion. Our non-GAAP operating margin in the first quarter was 23.8%, up 210 basis points from last year. The margin expansion reflects improved margins for our cloud operations along with effective operating expense management. As we discussed on previous calls, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model, have a meaningful impact on our overall margins as they are passed through to clients and are included in both revenues and cost of revenues. We paid merchant fees of approximately $42 million in Q1. \n Both cash flows from operations and free cash flow were above expectations for the quarter at $71.8 million and $57.2 million, respectively, which allowed us to repay the remaining $50 million of term debt outstanding from the NIC acquisition earlier in the year than planned.  We ended the quarter with $600 million of convertible debt outstanding and cash and investments of approximately $202 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 0.79x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA with our only remaining debt of $600 million convertible due in 2026. \n Our updated 2024 annual guidance is as follows. We expect total revenues will be between $2.110 billion and $2.140 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8.5%. We now expect that merchant fees will be up slightly over last year and that implied organic growth, excluding merchant fees, would be approximately 50 basis points higher. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.27 and $5.47 and may vary significantly due to the impact of discrete tax items on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $9.10 and $9.30. We expect to see sequential growth in earnings throughout the year with both revenues and EPS slightly weighted towards the second half. We expect our free cash flow margin will be between 17% and 19%, including the estimated impact of approximately $58 million of incremental cash taxes related to Section 174. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q1 earnings deck posted on our website.  \n Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn. \nH. Moore: Thanks, Brian. Our performance in the quarter demonstrates strong execution by team members across Tyler in key strategic areas, anchored to our Tyler 2030 Vision. We are starting to see the expected benefits of our cloud transition through progress with version consolidation, cloud optimization of products, cost efficiencies and improved agility as we empower our clients who serve the public through Tyler's next-generation cloud applications.  \n Our strong first quarter results and positive outlook for the remainder of the year are reflected in our revised annual guidance. Even with lower expectations for license revenues because of the accelerated shift to SaaS with our Public Safety and application platform solutions, we've raised our revenue guidance while also increasing our earnings outlook.  \n We recently published our 2023 corporate responsibility report, our fifth annual sustainability disclosure covering our environmental, social and governance activities. Our sustainability initiatives in 2023 included investments in data management, validation and processes to drive reporting efficiencies. We also undertook a double materiality assessment to understand key insights for multiple constituents on both financial materiality and impact materiality. We hope you take the time to review our report, which is available on our website.  \n Finally, we're excited about Tyler Connect 2024, which will take place May 19 to 22 in Indianapolis. Nearly 5,000 Tyler clients and 900 Tyler team members will come together for training, collaboration and networking, and we're looking forward to inspiring our clients with the latest innovations from Tyler.  \n Now we'd like to open the line for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Rob Oliver from Baird. \nRobert Oliver: Lynn, mine is for you. You mentioned in the outset of your prepared remarks, kind of your growth focus areas, but you talked about the kind of growing sales synergies and the integrated go-to-market strategy that you guys laid out in more detail last year. And I know this has been a big push of your since you assumed the CEO role. Could you give us a little bit of color on kind of what if some of those growing sales synergies are? Where you're excited about the progress you've had so far? What some of the levers you're pulling are? And what are some areas you still need to improve on? I appreciate it. \nH. Moore: Yes. Sure, Rob. It's a good question. Last year, we elevated a couple of people to oversee all of our public admin sales, all of our justice sales. They're working more closely together than ever before. We've done things around aligning some incentive comp plans and changing the way people are comped to make sure that, for example, it's -- in the old days, it's well -- whose P&L is this recognized by. And we wanted to break down some of those barriers so that really, when -- it's all about Tyler, when Tyler wins, everybody wins. And so we've been doing things like that. We've done some things, and we're still in the process of -- and some of that's still work-in-progress. \n I mean when I say that we started these initiatives, they're not by any means finished, but these are things that are work-in-progress. We're doing things around our PSD and DSD divisions, our application platform and formerly NIC, we see a lot of synergies there. So we're doing things right now to start to bring some of those divisions closer together so that they can work more closely with sales and operating efficiencies. We believe the application platform is tailor-made for state government. And so just a number of initiatives like that. It's -- there's a lot going on. And I think we're going to continue to see improvement as we look out forward. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia from Barclays. \nSaket Kalia: Lynn, the numbers are pretty straightforward. So maybe I'll ask just a little bit of a higher level question. It sounds like just the spending backdrop in state and local governments continues to sound healthy. But just to make sure the question is asked, can you talk about, Lynn, what you've seen historically from those customers in presidential election years? I mean I imagine that those 2 things aren't terribly related. But again, I just want to ask -- I want to make sure that question is asked as we kind of get deeper into election season. \nH. Moore: Yes, I don't know that historically, there's been much of a correlation between our sales and the presidential election year more so than what may be going on in the broader macroeconomic environment. As you note, the budgets for our clients are healthy and strong. Our sales outlook for the year, and we have some pretty aggressive sales plans, but our sales outlook for the year are looking on plan and significant parts of our business actually, may be ahead of plan. Maybe a little bit in the federal space. I don't know that I've got enough experience yet with our federal space as to what impact that may have. But it's normally more so around what's going on with the federal funding and budgets. But I think generally, in our -- if you look at our traditional local and state space, I haven't seen a lot of change in my 25 years plus. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt VanVliet from BTIG. \nMatthew VanVliet: I said you continue to see a higher and higher mix of business going to set contracts and I believe even see an acceleration to a certain extent on the flips side [indiscernible] Public Safety or maybe holding you back [indiscernible] the case for or, I guess, impetus to try to push forward on more flips, maybe encouraged customers at a little bit more of an accelerated pace to move over and just try to get this done with sort of as quickly as possible? Or any changing in your thinking there of the motivation of customers? \nH. Moore: And you're kind of cutting out, I think I got most of your question, Matt. I'll start. Brian, you can certainly jump in. At Public Safety, I think it's a couple of things. I think actually, as you step back and you go back to 2019, when we sort of announced that we were going to go cloud-first from cloud agnostic, some of the message was we were going -- at least internally was we were going to take our leadership position and start leading the market to where we thought it was going to go and needed to go. In Public Safety, as you know, historically, it's been a little bit slower. We've spent a couple of years. We've got some new leadership Public Safety. Our position in Public Safety is we're very competitive. It's a competitive space, but we're in a very competitive space and a place, excuse me. \n And really starting this year and started more so third quarter, fourth quarter last year, we've taken the approach that we are going to start leading with SaaS with Public Safety. And so that's resonating. We talked about the Palm Beach, Florida contract. That was a deal where they were only looking for a SaaS arrangement. As we look out this year, we're going to continue to do things to push things quicker to SaaS. At the end of the day, it's still the customer's choice. There's a lot of selling things around that. You look at our Public Safety, I think our plan for the year was to do about 50% on-prem licenses, give or take, which was up significantly from last year. And what we're seeing right now, I think we reported 75% in Q1. \n As it relates to flips, there's a lot of selling messages generally around flips and where all our sales folks are armed with those. I think one thing that you're also starting to see, and we've talked about it before on earnings calls is the continued rise of cybersecurity and ransomware attacks are also sort of triggering clients to want to push to SaaS faster. And the more that they see that out in their community, which aren't always publicized, I think that's also sort of starting to grease the wheels a little bit to make that decision to move to SaaS. \nBrian Miller: I guess, the only thing I'd add to that is, in terms of our ability to significantly increase, the pace of flips beyond the sales efforts that Lynn talked about. We have talked about in the past the need for clients who aren't on the current version of our products generally to upgrade to that version either before or when they look to the cloud as we drive towards having one version of each product in the cloud. And we've made a lot of progress with version consolidation and sunsetting old versions and moving clients along, but that continues to be a gating factor in the pace of flips. \n And so as we continue to make progress with that, it opens up more opportunities from clients being in a position to flip. But as we've talked about, especially as we move into the larger flips, they're complicated processes from a planning perspective. And so the timing leading up to the flip from the time we start engaging with clients, sometimes can be kind of lengthy. So we're certainly pushing it as fast as possible. We've talked about a road map that varies by product, but across all of our products, converges on us being at 80%, 85% of our on-prem customer base having moved to the cloud by 2030, and all of our business units have road maps that are aligned with that goal. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Oppenheimer. \nHoi-Fung Wong: This one for you, Lynn. When we look at the number of subscription contracts, it looks like it took a really big step up this quarter. I think you touched on some of the highlights. Just wondering if that's more of a kind of a lumpy volatile seasonality type of a situation we're seeing there from the jump up to 200? Or do you think that, that is perhaps a closer reflection of the run rate we can expect going forward? \nH. Moore: It's probably a little bit of both. I think one -- obviously, with 200 new deals are going to vary in size and scope. But if you step back generally, when I think about 200 new contracts a year -- a quarter, that plays out to over 800 a year. That's a lot of business we're doing, and that's a lot of business we're executing on. It's great work by our sales teams. It's great work by our ProServe teams to then turn that into revenue. But I think it's -- I don't know that that's the new -- it's certainly higher than it was coming out of Q4 last year and most of last year. I think last year, we did about 750 new deals, give or take for the year. So we're on pace a little better. But as I said, right now, markets are healthy, budgets are strong. Our sales outlook, all indicators are positive and our sales outlook looks good for the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alexei Gogolev of JPMorgan. \nAlexei Gogolev: Considering the elevated level of demand that Lynn, you just referred to, has your win rate remained relatively consistent at around 50%? And if it has, it feels like you should be taking more market share. Do you feel that you could show acceleration of organic revenue growth in the near term? \nH. Moore: Yes. Thanks, Alexei. I'd say, generally, our win rates across the board are consistent. And when you say 50%, that's -- you got to look by each sort of major products. So there's certainly some areas where our win rates are 80%, 85%, some that are more competitive spaces, we talk about Public Safety, we talk about sort of the mid- to higher ERP space where there's -- it's a lot more competitive market, and they may sort of be around there. So those really haven't changed. There's still -- we still have some of the same lag factors that we talked about before between time of getting a deal to contract to getting them up and running. But yes, I mean, we -- as we look out, we've -- our overall revenue growth sort of slowed over the last 2 years, and I think we've said we expect that to pick back up, and we're starting to see some of that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Reilly from Needham & Company. \nJoshua Reilly: So we're hearing some of your venture-backed start-up competitors in Public Safety, specifically records management are having challenges getting customers live. Are you using this as an opportunity to go back to these customers and highlight the Tyler value proposition? And then just more broadly, how often have you seen this across other product lines where some of the venture-backed start-ups are making promises about getting customers live on timelines that they are unable to execute on? \nH. Moore: Yes, Joshua, that's a good question. And it's something we've seen, I'd say, really, over the 25-plus years I've been at Tyler. There's always seems to be little periods where someone comes up, makes little splash, they have a little spotlight on them. They certainly have a demo that looks good. They wouldn't have the depth of functionality and products that we've had because they haven't been in the space for as long as we have, but they win some business, but that's only part of the battle. We've always said part of Tyler secrets sauce is not just winning the business, but executing on the business. And it's hard stuff. Take, for example, our municipal and schools division, which really sells more on the low end of ERP and has some courts and things like that. \n They did, I think, last year -- I mean last quarter, they did 207 go-lives in 1 quarter. Now obviously, that's a -- those are small deals, but that's a lot of business. And that's the hard part. And people, I think, from the outside, generally sort of look at Tyler's results and say, boy, this is an easy business. This business is something we ought to invest in and get into. And what we found, not just with venture-backed, but some PE money that's come in, is they didn't really understand the market, and it's a lot more difficult than it may look at times from the outside. And it's a testament to all our hardworking people at Tyler, it's testament to our culture, it's a testament how we view our relationships with our clients. So no, it's -- I appreciate you bringing that up because it's not something we spend a lot of time talking about. But it's -- you're only successful as your last implementation in this business and all our clients talk. So when you fail, everybody knows. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. \nClarke Jeffries: Brian, very encouraging to see operating margins up substantially, and operating income dollars up 19% year-over-year. You talked about improved cloud operations as a driver of that. Does that mean that some of the capacity in the private cloud is already being reduced? And you're taking up EPS today, but could you talk a little bit about the expectations for full year, how operating margins pan out for the rest of the year? \nBrian Miller: Yes. It's not so much of the capacity. We do continue to move clients to AWS, and we are on track with our plans to evacuate our first data center midyear of this year. But really, that -- a lot of those costs don't go out until after that data center is closed. So that's not really the biggest factor. Some of the things driving those improved cloud efficiencies are the releases we've had over recent quarters of the cloud optimized versions of our product, which improves the efficiencies and lowers our hosting costs at AWS. The progress we've made with version consolidation, and we made significant progress last year and continue to have aggressive plans this year about sunsetting older versions of products and getting the benefits from both support costs and development costs around the expenses associated with supporting multiple versions of multiple products.\n And the new AWS agreement that we talked about last quarter has provided us with increased efficiencies or increased cost efficiencies around our hosting costs. So  all of those are continuing to play out. And then on the revenue side, the outperformance in terms of revenues, especially on the payment side, where we were able to cover fixed costs in a better way with incremental revenues from things like driver history records above our plan that contributed there. And then lastly, we mentioned briefly, but continue to have effective expense management of OpEx. So both sales and marketing and G&A costs are growing at a slower rate than our than our overall revenues. So we're getting efficiencies there and those factor into the rest of the year as well. \nH. Moore: Yes. Clarke, I'd add, we are seeing efficiencies through the cloud, but there's still a runway to go in the efficiencies that we're going to achieve. And there's some other internal initiatives, we don't talk a lot about, things like improving our gross margins on pro services. We've seen -- we saw an uptick of that in Q1. That's really a function of a few different things. It's more of -- it's a strategic focus that we started working on last year. But it's also a function of that we've had a more stable labor market. Our turnover has been much lower and sort of returned back to pre-COVID levels. And that really helps. It helps drive billable utilization.  Other internal initiatives around things like rationalization of some internal IT costs and real estate costs. Things that we've been working on behind the scenes are all starting to show some results in addition to the cloud. But I want to emphasize that the efficiencies that we're going to see from further version consolidation and optimization and all the things that we're going to do in the cloud are still out there for us to go capture. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo Securities. \nMichael Turrin: Maybe on transaction revenue, the prepared materials mentioned a customer change from gross to net.  Would be curious on the rationale there, whether that's something we could see other customers elect for? And Brian, maybe you can just walk through both the margin impacts for us to consider there as well as the increased growth guide. Fast start came up a couple of times on the call, but if there's any supporting commentary on what's driving that, also helpful. \nBrian Miller: Sure. Yes, last year, and we talked about this some last year, we actually had 2 clients last year, state enterprise clients that had changes from the gross to the net model. And still, the vast majority of our payments business is on the gross model, and we expect that to continue to be the case. So we really don't see sort of large-scale changes like that ahead. It is a client decision. Most of our clients prefer the certainty and predictability they get from having a growth arrangement with us, where we're responsible for the merchant fees and interchange fees and bear the risk of the fluctuation of those. And -- so most of our clients prefer that. \n These two clients, one changed towards the beginning of the year. The one that's still impacting our comparisons changed midyear last year, and they had roughly between $4 million and $5 million, a quarter of merchant fees associated with that account. So it will impact us in terms of our comparison for the first half of this year, and then it will lap itself and it won't be a factor. So as a result, our growth in transaction revenues because of that impact, and again, an impact on revenues, it actually improves margins by going to the gross model and the merchant fees for the first half of the year will just be up -- or transaction fees for the first half of the year, grow in the low single digits. But the second half of the year, we expect low to mid-teens when that impact has lapped. But again, I don't see that as a real trend going forward, but it is a client decision on an individual basis and different clients have different approaches to the risk they're willing to take and whether they're willing to manage those and pay those merchant interchange fees directly themselves. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair. \nJonathan Ho: Just wanted to maybe understand a little bit better the progress that you're seeing, I guess, adding more transaction-based systems to your existing customers. Can you give us a sense of how penetrated you are in terms of those transaction systems? And whether you're sort of on plan or on track in terms of adding more content to these existing contracts? \nH. Moore: Yes, that's a good question, Jonathan. I don't have those numbers just off here off the top of my head, we certainly can get back to you with those. I would say that generally speaking, we got a long runway left. We're still pretty early in our transactions business. You can point to our presentation at Tyler 2030 for how we saw transactions revenue to grow and the cash flow from that over the next 5 to 6 years. \nBrian Miller: Yes. We're still in the very early stages, very early innings of driving that cross-sell. We've done a lot of work with integrating the payments platform into our software products that have significant payments capabilities, things like utility billing and traffic court and licensing and permitting. And then as Lynn talked about earlier, the initiatives we've had to -- that in place more effective cross-selling sales motions. And we're starting to see the impact of that with, I think, we see 288 new payments deals across Tyler's customer base, but it's a very small fraction that we've penetrated so far of our software customer base with our payments platform, and that continues to build momentum, and we're really pleased with -- I'd say we're at least on track with our plans for this year. But again, in the very early innings of that. \nH. Moore: Yes. And I'd add to that, Jonathan. I mean, last -- I guess, now 2 years ago, we acquired Rapid Financial, which is the disbursements world. We are -- we barely scratched the surface with that. So still a lot to do on both sides. I would say if you look -- again, point you to our 2030 presentation, I'd say we're kind of on track right now for that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum from Northcoast Research. \nKeith Housum: I want to unpack a comment you made earlier in terms of cybersecurity as a driver of public agencies moving to the cloud. Are we seeing like the concerns about ransomware and cybersecurity is perhaps a tailwind that you guys are dealing now with just for public safety, but across the board? And are you seeing the life cycle of the systems that you're replacing, is that shrinking? So are we seeing an acceleration in the refresh cycle, albeit it might be small, but are we seeing some level of that, you think? \nH. Moore: I don't know about that. I guess I would just say that -- so my comment before on cybersecurity is look, we all know what's out there. It's a big event when it happens to a client.  Generally, they -- as I said, they view us and we view them as their trusted partner, and we're usually there to help them. And one of the things that they realize quickly is getting them into the cloud will make them much more secure.  It's -- to say that there's driving flips, it is. It's not a huge tailwind, but it's out there. And it's not necessarily something that we're hoping for. But it's just a fact of life. It's a fact of doing business in today's world. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kirk Materne from Evercore ISI. \nS. Kirk Materne: Brian, on the 21% growth in ARR and the flip, is that just largely pricing? Does that include cross-sell, upsell? I guess what does that entail? Is that -- I'm just trying to get a sense of it, that's sort of apples-to-apples or if you're seeing some of the sales synergies Lynn discussed earlier, factoring into that growth as well. \nBrian Miller: Yes. I think the biggest factor is larger average deal size. So we're seeing at least in the mix this quarter, and it won't necessarily be consistent every quarter because that can be kind of lumpy what that mix is. But we saw more bigger customers move we highlighted one of them, Fulton County, Georgia, with their tax solution. I think $1.3 million in ARR from that one. So seeing generally more larger customers in the mix. Last quarter, we had our first court flip. This quarter, we had the pellet court in Kansas flipping. \n So it's more around the average size of the clients. But there also is upsell in those as well. So I think the average we've talked about still tends to be about 1.7, 1.8x uplift relative to the maintenance, but in some of these -- especially some of the larger ones, we've seen a bigger uplift where we've added new services or additional products when they flip. So a combination of both of those things. \nH. Moore: Yes. And Kirk, I think there's also been a few occasions where we may have won business a while ago. And to get that business, we had some contract concessions, maybe had some fixed pricing for a period of time. And the SaaS flip is an opportunity to sort of revisit that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. \nGabriela Borges: And Brian, I want to reconcile some of the commentary you're making on transaction -- on the transaction business. You commented specifically around higher transaction volumes and better pricing. So maybe just help us understand, is the volume is a function of the traction you're making in cross-sell and the run rate that you talked about earlier? Or is there an underlying dynamic going on as well? And then if you could touch on the pricing as well. Is there an additional dynamic around better pricing, independent of some of the specific contracts you talked about changing from gross to net and vice versa? \nBrian Miller: Yes. On the pricing side, specifically, we've talked about that as we continue to drive more business into the Tyler software customer base, we're able to generally achieve premium pricing or better pricing than a sort of a commodities type payment arrangement where we provide additional value from things like automated reconciliations. So having the software or the payments platform embedded with the software creates additional value for the customer and lets us get better pricing than some of the just payments-only type contracts. \n So as we continue to add those, we're seeing improvements there. We've seen as well some price increases in some of our revenue-sharing arrangements with third-party payment processors that have also benefited us. And then we also saw, even though they're down year-over-year, we saw better-than-expected revenues from some of the other transaction volumes like driver history records, which tend to be a higher margin business as well. So sort of a combination of things driving that pricing. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel from Loop Capital Markets. \nMark Schappel: John, I believe the remaining ARPA funds must be allocated by year-end. I was wondering if you could just comment on the impact ARPA funds are having on your business today. And whether you anticipate any demand falling off next year as these funds come to an end? \nJohn Marr: Yes. The ARPU funds generally have to be committed by the end of 2024 and spent by the end of 2026. And so the commitments -- I mean, largely, I think, at this point across the universe of our customers and prospects, I think the majority of those have been committed probably a strong majority, I think, 80%, 85%, maybe more than that. But committed and sort of an internal commitment and doesn't necessarily mean that they've even started a buying process. So they may have committed funds for a new ERP system, but they haven't even issued the RFP yet. \n We've said that we believe it is a factor in the strong market conditions we've talked about, but not the biggest factor. And so we expect it to continue to be a tailwind of some sort, really through 2026 as those commitments turn into purchases and then turn into deliveries and revenue recognition for us. But we don't expect a big drop-off after that. Most -- we think some of them -- some of the funds used for things like hardware purchases around our school transportation solution that are sort of onetime purchases. But generally, when they're buying something from us, it creates a recurring revenue stream that they may fund the first 2 or 3 years out of ARPA funds, and then they have an ongoing expense with us for a subscription. So I think it's a tailwind, not the biggest factor in the market, we're seeing the one that we'll continue for a while. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Terry Tillman from Truist Securities. \nTerrell Tillman: Most of my questions have been asked -- answered. But one question I still had was, maybe we could talk about traction with AI-powered acquisitions. I think it was called out and it's on your slide deck. Just kind of curious, I know these were probably small acquisitions, but I'm curious about the revenue size of these products. And maybe kind of stack rank in terms of -- in your possession and with your size and scale and go-to-market, how would these opportunities stack up versus maybe what you did in the parks and recreation area or the vend engine and stuff in jails in the recent past? Just trying to better understand how meaningful these could be. \nH. Moore: Yes. Thanks, Terry. So I guess, first of all, like I said, we're early with these acquisitions. These acquisitions really fit the mold of acquisitions that we've done that have been very successful, which is a product differentiator that we can take into our installed base where we've got a really commanding position to leverage. I think each one of these 3 are -- have different growth trajectories, which is another one of our criteria is can this grow at a rate faster than Tyler's overall rate? And I think all 3 of these clearly ticked that box. I think the acquisition of CSI probably has a little bit bigger near-term market opportunity. The RexourceX will drive sufficient -- a lot of revenue in its own right, but it's also going to drive higher win rates for our ERP solutions, which is not necessarily as measurable.\n AR Inspect our field operations, new product. Again, we talked about there's a lot of interest there, a lot of excitement. And I'd expect that to really sort of all of them to outperform our expectations coming in. But based on those -- the criteria that I sort of originally outlined. So we're excited about all three of these. We're generally excited about every acquisition we do. But we -- these are off and running and off to a good start, and we're already seeing movements in the market based on these three acquisitions, and that's what's really appealing to me. \nBrian Miller: And collectively, those 3 are around $4 million of revenues for the quarter. So yes, small compared to Tyler's total. But interestingly, a couple of those deals we called out were significantly sized deals with large customers. So the Dallas County CSI, almost $1 million of ARR from the CSI product. So you see how that -- relative to a business group that are collectively doing around $4 million a quarter in revenues, adding single contracts that add $1 million of ARR is off to a nice start. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. \nAleksandr Zukin: So correct me if I'm wrong, but this is, I think, the first time since almost like 2014 that you've actually raised the top line guide for the full year after Q1. So maybe Lynn, just talk about and walk through what's giving you that confidence to do that? You guys don't usually do that. Is it improving demand from new arrangements as it flips? Is it transaction revenue expectations? It might be all of the above. It might be the M&A. But like what is driving that incremental confidence and conviction to kind of do something you don't usually do? \nH. Moore: Yes, it's a good point, Alex. And I was actually thinking to myself, when was the last time we'd ever done it, because I couldn't recall and you did my homework and told me it was 10 years ago. We just come off our management quarterly meetings. We've got really good visibility on what we see out there. And I would say it's improved. I talked earlier about not just the demand in the market, but what we're seeing for our sales outlook. We're just seeing a lot of things lining up in a way that gives us that confidence to do it, as you point out, I mean, it's not something we typically do. We were -- I wouldn't say we were conservative, but we like to not get ahead of our skis. And we'd like to tell you what we're going to do then we're going to go do it. And it's just -- it's a combination of a lot of factors. \n I can tell you that for the last couple of years, one of the mantras I've been saying within Tyler to not just the management team, but to all the employees, whether it's in a town hall or what is, I would say, the last couple of years, I have never been more excited about Tyler's future than I am today. And coming into this year and really the last couple of months, I've switched that a little bit. So I've never been more confident in Tyler's future then I am today. And again, it's just a lot of things going right. We're clicking on all cylinders right now, and we've got an aligned management team with a singular vision, singular focus. There's a lot of initiatives going on at Tyler. I mean we're not just sitting back. There's a lot of things going on, but I just like where we sit right now. \nBrian Miller: And just generally, the revenue outperformance in Q1, obviously, it was not sort of pull forward or timing of things that we might have seen in the later quarter, especially around the transaction-based revenue, truly was additive to what we expected for the rest of the year. And so that drove us raising the outlook for the full year. \nAleksandr Zukin: And I usually never asked this follow-up question, particularly because we love margins, and we love efficiency. But I guess, given this, call it, once in a decade incrementally higher level of confidence and conviction this early in a year. Is there a world where you do maybe push the throttle a little bit more on investments, both organic and/or inorganic as it does seem like the market seems to be coming to you at a faster pace? \nH. Moore: It's a good question, Alex. I think we -- I mean I don't know that we'll deviate from our historical practice of just taking a disciplined approach. We've got plans in place as it relates to margin and investment. I like our balance right now, I like our capital allocation where we sit right now. So I don't think you're going to hear us say this isn't 2017, 2018, where we're going to say, hey, this is now the time for elevated investment. We've got plenty of investments going on. And like I said, a lot of initiatives and both around revenue growth and margin expansion. So I don't think you'll hear that out of us over the next several quarters. \nOperator: This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Lynn Moore for closing remarks. \nH. Moore: Thanks, Krista, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks again, and have a great day. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Brian Miller",
            "content": "Lynn, total revenues for the quarter were $512.4 million, up 8.6% and organically grew to 7.8%. Subscriptions revenue increased 11.7% and organically rose 11.4%. Within subscriptions, our SaaS revenues grew 22% to $148.8 million and grew organically 21.3%. Keep in mind that there's often a lag from the signing of a new SaaS deal or a flip to the start of revenue recognition that can vary from one to several quarters. Because of this, as well as the timing of SaaS renewals and related price increases, SaaS revenue growth, both year-over-year and sequentially may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter.  \n Transaction revenues grew 3.7% to $164.5 million. While transaction revenues exceeded our plan, primarily due to higher transaction volumes from new and existing clients, including driver history records, the year-over-year comparison continues to be impacted by the change last year from the gross model to the net model for payments under one of our state enterprise agreement. SaaS deals comprised approximately 93% of our Q1 new software contract value compared to 87% last year.  \n During the quarter, we added 200 new SaaS arrangements and converted 90 existing on-premises SaaS clients -- on-premises clients to SaaS with a total contract value of approximately $86 million. In Q1 of last year, we added 145 new SaaS arrangements and had 73 on-premises conversions with a total contract value of approximately $86 million. More importantly, the average ARR associated with our Q1 flips increased 21.5% over last year. Including transaction revenues, expansions with existing clients and professional services, total bookings increased 15.7% on an organic basis.  \n Our total annualized recurring revenue was approximately $1.72 billion, up 8.8% and organically grew 8.2%. In previous quarters, we discussed our expectation that 2023 would be the operating margin trough from our cloud transition and that 2024 would mark a return to operating margin expansion. Our non-GAAP operating margin in the first quarter was 23.8%, up 210 basis points from last year. The margin expansion reflects improved margins for our cloud operations along with effective operating expense management. As we discussed on previous calls, merchant and interchange fees from our payments business under the gross revenue model, have a meaningful impact on our overall margins as they are passed through to clients and are included in both revenues and cost of revenues. We paid merchant fees of approximately $42 million in Q1. \n Both cash flows from operations and free cash flow were above expectations for the quarter at $71.8 million and $57.2 million, respectively, which allowed us to repay the remaining $50 million of term debt outstanding from the NIC acquisition earlier in the year than planned.  We ended the quarter with $600 million of convertible debt outstanding and cash and investments of approximately $202 million. Our net leverage at quarter end was approximately 0.79x trailing 12-month pro forma EBITDA with our only remaining debt of $600 million convertible due in 2026. \n Our updated 2024 annual guidance is as follows. We expect total revenues will be between $2.110 billion and $2.140 billion. The midpoint of our guidance implies organic growth of approximately 8.5%. We now expect that merchant fees will be up slightly over last year and that implied organic growth, excluding merchant fees, would be approximately 50 basis points higher. We expect GAAP diluted EPS will be between $5.27 and $5.47 and may vary significantly due to the impact of discrete tax items on the GAAP effective tax rate. We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS will be between $9.10 and $9.30. We expect to see sequential growth in earnings throughout the year with both revenues and EPS slightly weighted towards the second half. We expect our free cash flow margin will be between 17% and 19%, including the estimated impact of approximately $58 million of incremental cash taxes related to Section 174. Other details of our guidance are included in our earnings release and in the Q1 earnings deck posted on our website.  \n Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Lynn. I guess, the only thing I'd add to that is, in terms of our ability to significantly increase, the pace of flips beyond the sales efforts that Lynn talked about. We have talked about in the past the need for clients who aren't on the current version of our products generally to upgrade to that version either before or when they look to the cloud as we drive towards having one version of each product in the cloud. And we've made a lot of progress with version consolidation and sunsetting old versions and moving clients along, but that continues to be a gating factor in the pace of flips. \n And so as we continue to make progress with that, it opens up more opportunities from clients being in a position to flip. But as we've talked about, especially as we move into the larger flips, they're complicated processes from a planning perspective. And so the timing leading up to the flip from the time we start engaging with clients, sometimes can be kind of lengthy. So we're certainly pushing it as fast as possible. We've talked about a road map that varies by product, but across all of our products, converges on us being at 80%, 85% of our on-prem customer base having moved to the cloud by 2030, and all of our business units have road maps that are aligned with that goal. Yes. It's not so much of the capacity. We do continue to move clients to AWS, and we are on track with our plans to evacuate our first data center midyear of this year. But really, that -- a lot of those costs don't go out until after that data center is closed. So that's not really the biggest factor. Some of the things driving those improved cloud efficiencies are the releases we've had over recent quarters of the cloud optimized versions of our product, which improves the efficiencies and lowers our hosting costs at AWS. The progress we've made with version consolidation, and we made significant progress last year and continue to have aggressive plans this year about sunsetting older versions of products and getting the benefits from both support costs and development costs around the expenses associated with supporting multiple versions of multiple products.\n And the new AWS agreement that we talked about last quarter has provided us with increased efficiencies or increased cost efficiencies around our hosting costs. So  all of those are continuing to play out. And then on the revenue side, the outperformance in terms of revenues, especially on the payment side, where we were able to cover fixed costs in a better way with incremental revenues from things like driver history records above our plan that contributed there. And then lastly, we mentioned briefly, but continue to have effective expense management of OpEx. So both sales and marketing and G&A costs are growing at a slower rate than our than our overall revenues. So we're getting efficiencies there and those factor into the rest of the year as well. Sure. Yes, last year, and we talked about this some last year, we actually had 2 clients last year, state enterprise clients that had changes from the gross to the net model. And still, the vast majority of our payments business is on the gross model, and we expect that to continue to be the case. So we really don't see sort of large-scale changes like that ahead. It is a client decision. Most of our clients prefer the certainty and predictability they get from having a growth arrangement with us, where we're responsible for the merchant fees and interchange fees and bear the risk of the fluctuation of those. And -- so most of our clients prefer that. \n These two clients, one changed towards the beginning of the year. The one that's still impacting our comparisons changed midyear last year, and they had roughly between $4 million and $5 million, a quarter of merchant fees associated with that account. So it will impact us in terms of our comparison for the first half of this year, and then it will lap itself and it won't be a factor. So as a result, our growth in transaction revenues because of that impact, and again, an impact on revenues, it actually improves margins by going to the gross model and the merchant fees for the first half of the year will just be up -- or transaction fees for the first half of the year, grow in the low single digits. But the second half of the year, we expect low to mid-teens when that impact has lapped. But again, I don't see that as a real trend going forward, but it is a client decision on an individual basis and different clients have different approaches to the risk they're willing to take and whether they're willing to manage those and pay those merchant interchange fees directly themselves. Yes. We're still in the very early stages, very early innings of driving that cross-sell. We've done a lot of work with integrating the payments platform into our software products that have significant payments capabilities, things like utility billing and traffic court and licensing and permitting. And then as Lynn talked about earlier, the initiatives we've had to -- that in place more effective cross-selling sales motions. And we're starting to see the impact of that with, I think, we see 288 new payments deals across Tyler's customer base, but it's a very small fraction that we've penetrated so far of our software customer base with our payments platform, and that continues to build momentum, and we're really pleased with -- I'd say we're at least on track with our plans for this year. But again, in the very early innings of that. Yes. I think the biggest factor is larger average deal size. So we're seeing at least in the mix this quarter, and it won't necessarily be consistent every quarter because that can be kind of lumpy what that mix is. But we saw more bigger customers move we highlighted one of them, Fulton County, Georgia, with their tax solution. I think $1.3 million in ARR from that one. So seeing generally more larger customers in the mix. Last quarter, we had our first court flip. This quarter, we had the pellet court in Kansas flipping. \n So it's more around the average size of the clients. But there also is upsell in those as well. So I think the average we've talked about still tends to be about 1.7, 1.8x uplift relative to the maintenance, but in some of these -- especially some of the larger ones, we've seen a bigger uplift where we've added new services or additional products when they flip. So a combination of both of those things. Yes. On the pricing side, specifically, we've talked about that as we continue to drive more business into the Tyler software customer base, we're able to generally achieve premium pricing or better pricing than a sort of a commodities type payment arrangement where we provide additional value from things like automated reconciliations. So having the software or the payments platform embedded with the software creates additional value for the customer and lets us get better pricing than some of the just payments-only type contracts. \n So as we continue to add those, we're seeing improvements there. We've seen as well some price increases in some of our revenue-sharing arrangements with third-party payment processors that have also benefited us. And then we also saw, even though they're down year-over-year, we saw better-than-expected revenues from some of the other transaction volumes like driver history records, which tend to be a higher margin business as well. So sort of a combination of things driving that pricing. And collectively, those 3 are around $4 million of revenues for the quarter. So yes, small compared to Tyler's total. But interestingly, a couple of those deals we called out were significantly sized deals with large customers. So the Dallas County CSI, almost $1 million of ARR from the CSI product. So you see how that -- relative to a business group that are collectively doing around $4 million a quarter in revenues, adding single contracts that add $1 million of ARR is off to a nice start. And just generally, the revenue outperformance in Q1, obviously, it was not sort of pull forward or timing of things that we might have seen in the later quarter, especially around the transaction-based revenue, truly was additive to what we expected for the rest of the year. And so that drove us raising the outlook for the full year."

            "content": "Thanks, Hala. Our first quarter results provided an exceptional start to the year, exceeding our expectations across key metrics, including revenues, earnings, operating margin and cash flow. Recurring revenues grew almost 9% and comprised 84% of our total revenues. SaaS revenues grew 22%, our 13th consecutive quarter of SaaS revenue growth of 20% or more, exceeding expectations of a 20% CAGR in SaaS revenues through 2025. In addition, transaction revenue surpassed our plan with higher volumes and positive pricing trends.  \n Our performance demonstrates the power of our business model against the backdrop of robust public sector demand, supported by generally healthy budgets. Our leading sales activity indicators remain elevated, and our pipeline reflects growing sales synergies as we execute our integrated go-to-market strategy.  \n During our Investor Day last year, we announced our Tyler 2030 Vision, which aligns our strategic focus on 4 key growth drivers: leveraging our installed base, expanding into new markets, completing our cloud transition, and growing our payments business.  \n Leveraging our unmatched installed base has been a cornerstone of our growth strategy, and we're pleased with the outstanding execution by our sales organization, driving impactful cross-sell and upsell activity that further deepens existing client relationships and expands our market reach with new client engagements. Notable cross-sell and upsell wins during the quarter included a records management and ERP pro contract, including payments with Ada County, Idaho, leveraging our state enterprise relationship. And on-premises contract, for our full enterprise Public Safety suite with the City of Columbus, Georgia, adding to its existing Tyler courts, corrections, ERP, tax and permitting solutions.  \n An enterprise ERP win with the Texas Legislative Council facilitated by our existing Digital Solutions division relationship in Texas, which avoided an RFP process to secure a new enterprise ERP client in a nontraditional market. A combined SaaS contract with the city of Juneau, Alaska, for enterprise assessment and tax and enterprise permitting and licensing solutions. By prioritizing the cloud as one of our key growth drivers, we are unlocking new levels of innovation and responsiveness in making the cloud accessible for our clients, while providing enhanced security. Our new software SaaS mix continue to expand and comprised 93% of Q1 new software contract value. \n We're particularly encouraged to see a growing preference for cloud technology in the state and federal market with our application platform and an accelerated shift in Public Safety cloud demand with multiple client-driven SaaS selections. In fact, 75% of our first quarter enterprise Public Safety deals were SaaS. Because the pace of the shift to SaaS in these markets this year is faster than we previously anticipated, we have lowered our expectations for license revenues for the year. And across Tyler, the volume of flip signed in the first quarter was in line with our expectations, with a 21.5% increase in average ARR.  \n Key first quarter new SaaS deals and flips included multiyear SaaS arrangements with the Hawaii Department of Natural Resources and land between the Lakes National Recreation area that build on our momentum in the outdoor recreation space. Competitive SaaS wins for Public Safety included a full enterprise Public Safety suite contract with Palm Beach, Florida, which was focused on a cloud-only strategy. We also won a sole-source enterprise Public Safety contract with the city of Evanston, Illinois, which expands our growing footprint in the Chicagoland area. An enterprise appraisal in tax for Fulton County, Georgia, which includes Atlanta. The contracts with ARR of more than $1 million was executed on accelerated timeline with a go-live completed within 1 month. Two Public Safety SaaS flips with Beringham, Alabama and Germantown, Tennessee, both of which were client-driven SaaS selections and accelerated go-lives. The Kansas judicial branch signed an enterprise justice appellate court SaaS flip as we continue to see a growing interest in moving to the cloud from our on-premises courts clients.  \n Another key driver of our long-term growth is our transactions and payments business. As I mentioned earlier, better-than-expected transaction volumes contributed to first quarter revenues that exceeded our expectations. In the first quarter, we signed 288 new payments deals across Tyler, representing approximately $9 million in projected ARR. In our state enterprise portal business, we signed a new 3-year enterprise contract with the State of Mississippi, extending our existing 14-year relationship. Our enterprise agreement with the State of Idaho was also renewed for 2 years in a rebid through the NASPO Citizen Engagement agreement.  \n We're also very pleased to see early traction and growing demand for the solutions we added to our portfolio through our 2023 acquisitions of CSI, ARInspect and RexourceX, each of which brought us expanded AI capabilities. With CSI, we signed a contract with our existing course client in Dallas County, Texas, adding approximately $900,000 of ARR. We've seen demo activity double over pre-acquisition levels for our augmented field operation solution, formerly ARInspect, with first quarter wins that included the city of Newark manhole inspections and an expansion contract with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection.  \n For our priority-based budgeting solution powered by RexourceX, we signed contracts with Collier County, Florida and Fort Worth, Texas that added almost $600,000 of ARR.  \n Now I'd like Brian to provide more detail on the results for the quarter and our updated annual guidance for 2024. Thanks, Brian. Our performance in the quarter demonstrates strong execution by team members across Tyler in key strategic areas, anchored to our Tyler 2030 Vision. We are starting to see the expected benefits of our cloud transition through progress with version consolidation, cloud optimization of products, cost efficiencies and improved agility as we empower our clients who serve the public through Tyler's next-generation cloud applications.  \n Our strong first quarter results and positive outlook for the remainder of the year are reflected in our revised annual guidance. Even with lower expectations for license revenues because of the accelerated shift to SaaS with our Public Safety and application platform solutions, we've raised our revenue guidance while also increasing our earnings outlook.  \n We recently published our 2023 corporate responsibility report, our fifth annual sustainability disclosure covering our environmental, social and governance activities. Our sustainability initiatives in 2023 included investments in data management, validation and processes to drive reporting efficiencies. We also undertook a double materiality assessment to understand key insights for multiple constituents on both financial materiality and impact materiality. We hope you take the time to review our report, which is available on our website.  \n Finally, we're excited about Tyler Connect 2024, which will take place May 19 to 22 in Indianapolis. Nearly 5,000 Tyler clients and 900 Tyler team members will come together for training, collaboration and networking, and we're looking forward to inspiring our clients with the latest innovations from Tyler.  \n Now we'd like to open the line for Q&A. Yes. Sure, Rob. It's a good question. Last year, we elevated a couple of people to oversee all of our public admin sales, all of our justice sales. They're working more closely together than ever before. We've done things around aligning some incentive comp plans and changing the way people are comped to make sure that, for example, it's -- in the old days, it's well -- whose P&L is this recognized by. And we wanted to break down some of those barriers so that really, when -- it's all about Tyler, when Tyler wins, everybody wins. And so we've been doing things like that. We've done some things, and we're still in the process of -- and some of that's still work-in-progress. \n I mean when I say that we started these initiatives, they're not by any means finished, but these are things that are work-in-progress. We're doing things around our PSD and DSD divisions, our application platform and formerly NIC, we see a lot of synergies there. So we're doing things right now to start to bring some of those divisions closer together so that they can work more closely with sales and operating efficiencies. We believe the application platform is tailor-made for state government. And so just a number of initiatives like that. It's -- there's a lot going on. And I think we're going to continue to see improvement as we look out forward. Yes, I don't know that historically, there's been much of a correlation between our sales and the presidential election year more so than what may be going on in the broader macroeconomic environment. As you note, the budgets for our clients are healthy and strong. Our sales outlook for the year, and we have some pretty aggressive sales plans, but our sales outlook for the year are looking on plan and significant parts of our business actually, may be ahead of plan. Maybe a little bit in the federal space. I don't know that I've got enough experience yet with our federal space as to what impact that may have. But it's normally more so around what's going on with the federal funding and budgets. But I think generally, in our -- if you look at our traditional local and state space, I haven't seen a lot of change in my 25 years plus. And you're kind of cutting out, I think I got most of your question, Matt. I'll start. Brian, you can certainly jump in. At Public Safety, I think it's a couple of things. I think actually, as you step back and you go back to 2019, when we sort of announced that we were going to go cloud-first from cloud agnostic, some of the message was we were going -- at least internally was we were going to take our leadership position and start leading the market to where we thought it was going to go and needed to go. In Public Safety, as you know, historically, it's been a little bit slower. We've spent a couple of years. We've got some new leadership Public Safety. Our position in Public Safety is we're very competitive. It's a competitive space, but we're in a very competitive space and a place, excuse me. \n And really starting this year and started more so third quarter, fourth quarter last year, we've taken the approach that we are going to start leading with SaaS with Public Safety. And so that's resonating. We talked about the Palm Beach, Florida contract. That was a deal where they were only looking for a SaaS arrangement. As we look out this year, we're going to continue to do things to push things quicker to SaaS. At the end of the day, it's still the customer's choice. There's a lot of selling things around that. You look at our Public Safety, I think our plan for the year was to do about 50% on-prem licenses, give or take, which was up significantly from last year. And what we're seeing right now, I think we reported 75% in Q1. \n As it relates to flips, there's a lot of selling messages generally around flips and where all our sales folks are armed with those. I think one thing that you're also starting to see, and we've talked about it before on earnings calls is the continued rise of cybersecurity and ransomware attacks are also sort of triggering clients to want to push to SaaS faster. And the more that they see that out in their community, which aren't always publicized, I think that's also sort of starting to grease the wheels a little bit to make that decision to move to SaaS. It's probably a little bit of both. I think one -- obviously, with 200 new deals are going to vary in size and scope. But if you step back generally, when I think about 200 new contracts a year -- a quarter, that plays out to over 800 a year. That's a lot of business we're doing, and that's a lot of business we're executing on. It's great work by our sales teams. It's great work by our ProServe teams to then turn that into revenue. But I think it's -- I don't know that that's the new -- it's certainly higher than it was coming out of Q4 last year and most of last year. I think last year, we did about 750 new deals, give or take for the year. So we're on pace a little better. But as I said, right now, markets are healthy, budgets are strong. Our sales outlook, all indicators are positive and our sales outlook looks good for the year. Yes. Thanks, Alexei. I'd say, generally, our win rates across the board are consistent. And when you say 50%, that's -- you got to look by each sort of major products. So there's certainly some areas where our win rates are 80%, 85%, some that are more competitive spaces, we talk about Public Safety, we talk about sort of the mid- to higher ERP space where there's -- it's a lot more competitive market, and they may sort of be around there. So those really haven't changed. There's still -- we still have some of the same lag factors that we talked about before between time of getting a deal to contract to getting them up and running. But yes, I mean, we -- as we look out, we've -- our overall revenue growth sort of slowed over the last 2 years, and I think we've said we expect that to pick back up, and we're starting to see some of that. Yes, Joshua, that's a good question. And it's something we've seen, I'd say, really, over the 25-plus years I've been at Tyler. There's always seems to be little periods where someone comes up, makes little splash, they have a little spotlight on them. They certainly have a demo that looks good. They wouldn't have the depth of functionality and products that we've had because they haven't been in the space for as long as we have, but they win some business, but that's only part of the battle. We've always said part of Tyler secrets sauce is not just winning the business, but executing on the business. And it's hard stuff. Take, for example, our municipal and schools division, which really sells more on the low end of ERP and has some courts and things like that. \n They did, I think, last year -- I mean last quarter, they did 207 go-lives in 1 quarter. Now obviously, that's a -- those are small deals, but that's a lot of business. And that's the hard part. And people, I think, from the outside, generally sort of look at Tyler's results and say, boy, this is an easy business. This business is something we ought to invest in and get into. And what we found, not just with venture-backed, but some PE money that's come in, is they didn't really understand the market, and it's a lot more difficult than it may look at times from the outside. And it's a testament to all our hardworking people at Tyler, it's testament to our culture, it's a testament how we view our relationships with our clients. So no, it's -- I appreciate you bringing that up because it's not something we spend a lot of time talking about. But it's -- you're only successful as your last implementation in this business and all our clients talk. So when you fail, everybody knows. Yes. Clarke, I'd add, we are seeing efficiencies through the cloud, but there's still a runway to go in the efficiencies that we're going to achieve. And there's some other internal initiatives, we don't talk a lot about, things like improving our gross margins on pro services. We've seen -- we saw an uptick of that in Q1. That's really a function of a few different things. It's more of -- it's a strategic focus that we started working on last year. But it's also a function of that we've had a more stable labor market. Our turnover has been much lower and sort of returned back to pre-COVID levels. And that really helps. It helps drive billable utilization.  Other internal initiatives around things like rationalization of some internal IT costs and real estate costs. Things that we've been working on behind the scenes are all starting to show some results in addition to the cloud. But I want to emphasize that the efficiencies that we're going to see from further version consolidation and optimization and all the things that we're going to do in the cloud are still out there for us to go capture. Yes, that's a good question, Jonathan. I don't have those numbers just off here off the top of my head, we certainly can get back to you with those. I would say that generally speaking, we got a long runway left. We're still pretty early in our transactions business. You can point to our presentation at Tyler 2030 for how we saw transactions revenue to grow and the cash flow from that over the next 5 to 6 years. Yes. And I'd add to that, Jonathan. I mean, last -- I guess, now 2 years ago, we acquired Rapid Financial, which is the disbursements world. We are -- we barely scratched the surface with that. So still a lot to do on both sides. I would say if you look -- again, point you to our 2030 presentation, I'd say we're kind of on track right now for that. I don't know about that. I guess I would just say that -- so my comment before on cybersecurity is look, we all know what's out there. It's a big event when it happens to a client.  Generally, they -- as I said, they view us and we view them as their trusted partner, and we're usually there to help them. And one of the things that they realize quickly is getting them into the cloud will make them much more secure.  It's -- to say that there's driving flips, it is. It's not a huge tailwind, but it's out there. And it's not necessarily something that we're hoping for. But it's just a fact of life. It's a fact of doing business in today's world. Yes. And Kirk, I think there's also been a few occasions where we may have won business a while ago. And to get that business, we had some contract concessions, maybe had some fixed pricing for a period of time. And the SaaS flip is an opportunity to sort of revisit that. Yes. Thanks, Terry. So I guess, first of all, like I said, we're early with these acquisitions. These acquisitions really fit the mold of acquisitions that we've done that have been very successful, which is a product differentiator that we can take into our installed base where we've got a really commanding position to leverage. I think each one of these 3 are -- have different growth trajectories, which is another one of our criteria is can this grow at a rate faster than Tyler's overall rate? And I think all 3 of these clearly ticked that box. I think the acquisition of CSI probably has a little bit bigger near-term market opportunity. The RexourceX will drive sufficient -- a lot of revenue in its own right, but it's also going to drive higher win rates for our ERP solutions, which is not necessarily as measurable.\n AR Inspect our field operations, new product. Again, we talked about there's a lot of interest there, a lot of excitement. And I'd expect that to really sort of all of them to outperform our expectations coming in. But based on those -- the criteria that I sort of originally outlined. So we're excited about all three of these. We're generally excited about every acquisition we do. But we -- these are off and running and off to a good start, and we're already seeing movements in the market based on these three acquisitions, and that's what's really appealing to me. Yes, it's a good point, Alex. And I was actually thinking to myself, when was the last time we'd ever done it, because I couldn't recall and you did my homework and told me it was 10 years ago. We just come off our management quarterly meetings. We've got really good visibility on what we see out there. And I would say it's improved. I talked earlier about not just the demand in the market, but what we're seeing for our sales outlook. We're just seeing a lot of things lining up in a way that gives us that confidence to do it, as you point out, I mean, it's not something we typically do. We were -- I wouldn't say we were conservative, but we like to not get ahead of our skis. And we'd like to tell you what we're going to do then we're going to go do it. And it's just -- it's a combination of a lot of factors. \n I can tell you that for the last couple of years, one of the mantras I've been saying within Tyler to not just the management team, but to all the employees, whether it's in a town hall or what is, I would say, the last couple of years, I have never been more excited about Tyler's future than I am today. And coming into this year and really the last couple of months, I've switched that a little bit. So I've never been more confident in Tyler's future then I am today. And again, it's just a lot of things going right. We're clicking on all cylinders right now, and we've got an aligned management team with a singular vision, singular focus. There's a lot of initiatives going on at Tyler. I mean we're not just sitting back. There's a lot of things going on, but I just like where we sit right now. It's a good question, Alex. I think we -- I mean I don't know that we'll deviate from our historical practice of just taking a disciplined approach. We've got plans in place as it relates to margin and investment. I like our balance right now, I like our capital allocation where we sit right now. So I don't think you're going to hear us say this isn't 2017, 2018, where we're going to say, hey, this is now the time for elevated investment. We've got plenty of investments going on. And like I said, a lot of initiatives and both around revenue growth and margin expansion. So I don't think you'll hear that out of us over the next several quarters. Thanks, Krista, and thanks, everybody, for joining us today. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact Brian Miller or myself. Thanks again, and have a great day."

            "content": "Yes. The ARPU funds generally have to be committed by the end of 2024 and spent by the end of 2026. And so the commitments -- I mean, largely, I think, at this point across the universe of our customers and prospects, I think the majority of those have been committed probably a strong majority, I think, 80%, 85%, maybe more than that. But committed and sort of an internal commitment and doesn't necessarily mean that they've even started a buying process. So they may have committed funds for a new ERP system, but they haven't even issued the RFP yet. \n We've said that we believe it is a factor in the strong market conditions we've talked about, but not the biggest factor. And so we expect it to continue to be a tailwind of some sort, really through 2026 as those commitments turn into purchases and then turn into deliveries and revenue recognition for us. But we don't expect a big drop-off after that. Most -- we think some of them -- some of the funds used for things like hardware purchases around our school transportation solution that are sort of onetime purchases. But generally, when they're buying something from us, it creates a recurring revenue stream that they may fund the first 2 or 3 years out of ARPA funds, and then they have an ongoing expense with us for a subscription. So I think it's a tailwind, not the biggest factor in the market, we're seeing the one that we'll continue for a while."
