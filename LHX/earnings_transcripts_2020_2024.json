A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. On the call with me today are Bill Brown, our CEO; Chris Kubasik, our COO; and Jay Malave, our CFO. First, a few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our press release, presentation and SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. And to aid with year-over-year comparability following the L3Harris merger, prior year results will be on a pro forma basis. With that, Bill, I'll turn it over to you.\nBill Brown: Well, thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today we\u2019ve reported fourth quarter results, and I'd like to start by thanking our employees for their continued dedication and perseverance through 2020. Despite COVID, we've met customer commitments, advance the integration and deliver bottom-line results ahead of initial expectations all while keeping our workforce safe. We'll continue to follow mitigation plans implemented at the onset of the pandemic and keep them in place until widespread vaccinations have occurred. As a combined company, we're successfully executing the strategy we laid out a year and a half ago to drive shareholder value, and our progress is reflected in our operating results and outlook. First, we delivered solid results in 2020, where we exceeded our initial guidance on margins, earnings per share and free cash flow, offsetting the negative impacts of the pandemic with a solid 7% growth in our core U.S. government business and modest growth on the international side. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 18% from synergies and operational excellence and drove earnings per share up 13% consistent with our double-digit growth framework. With an eight-day improvement in working capital, we also generated strong free cash flow of nearly $2.7 billion. This along with progress on portfolio shaping enabled us to return $3 billion to shareholders and deliver growth and free cash flow per share of over 10%. Second, our guidance for the current year shows continued momentum in the business. With the fiscal 2021 budget now set and broad program support across key areas, we're in a position to deliver mid single-digit organic revenue growth at the midpoint, underpinned by the building blocks we previously described. Our DoD portfolio is well aligned with national security priorities. And while the overall budget is flat, we expect at least low single-digit growth driven by space, maritime, DoD modernization in classified programs. Revenue synergies will contribute about a point of growth with the notable driver being the SDA tracking layer award, as well as continued traction elsewhere with a win rate of about two-thirds of the 40 proposals awarded to-date. On the international front, we expect another \u2013 about another point from mid single-digit growth plus backed by a funded book-to-bill of above 1 in 2020 and a growing pipeline of pursuits. And then finally in our commercial businesses, we foresee a more modest impact of full year results as we lap COVID pressures following the first quarter. We also expect another year margin expansion supported by increased synergies and continued operational excellence, net of dilution from new program starts. We exited the year at $270 million in net cumulative synergy savings, $20 million ahead of our prior estimate. And with more confidence in savings from the supply chain, facility rationalization, shared services and functional efficiencies, we're now increasing our cumulative savings to $320 million to $350 million in 2021, up from a prior estimate of $300 million plus and still a year ahead of schedule. Our free cash flow guide of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion demonstrates clear progress towards our $3 billion target in 2022 with all cash use for capital returns to support double-digit earnings and free cash flow per share growth. Yesterday, we announced that our Board approved a new $6 billion share repurchase authorization alongside a 20% increase in our dividend, the third raise since we closed and bringing us closer to our target of a 30% to 35% payout of free cash flow. And then finally, we continue to position the business for long-term value creation by exiting non-core businesses and focusing our significant R&D investment on more strategic, technology-based business areas. We're now in the latter stages of several portfolio shaping processes, and we'll look to provide updates over the coming months. Our expectation continues to be for divestitures to represent a cumulative 8% to 10% of revenue with about a third completed to-date and all proceeds going towards repurchases. And we'll continue to sustain R&D spending at a peer high of nearly 4% of revenue with a focus on open architecture, multifunction software defined solutions across our broad C5ISR portfolio of capabilities. These technologies are essential to countering near peer threats across all domains and our past investments with a driver behind the recent SDA tracking layer, HBTSS, and next-gen jammer wins. So overall, we're clearly making progress in building a high-performance, technology-focused operating company and positioning L3Harris as a full end-to-end mission solutions prime. And with that, let me turn it over to you, Chris.\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 5. Integrated Mission Systems fourth quarter revenue was flat. Strong growth in our Maritime business continued as a result of several key wins during the year. We were awarded prime contracts for the medium unmanned surface vehicle program and the classified undersea acoustic systems program, which alongside an important win on the U.S. Navy frigate program, affirms our strategy to establish ourselves as both a prime contractor and a systems integrator. This progress was offset by a moderate decline in electro-optical due to program timing and an ISR due to aircraft timing. Our prior guidance assumed a December contract for ISR aircraft from an international customer that was delayed due to the customer's decision to expand the program. We are now awaiting parliamentary approval for that program. For the full year, revenue was up 3.3% from double-digit growth in Maritime and low single-digit growth in ISR. Operating income was up 7.2% in the fourth quarter and 21% for the year. And margins expanded 100 basis points to 14.3% and 230 basis points to 15.3% for the quarter in year, respectively. Our ISR business made significant progress on its international strategy with a contract to provide missionized ISR aircraft for the Canadian Air Force, capabilities on a Maritime patrol aircraft for a customer in the Asia-Pacific region and the introduction of potted SIGINT capability for unmanned aircraft for deployment in Europe and Asia. We have a strong pipeline as our allies appreciate the need for situational awareness that our systems provide. In Space and Airborne Systems, organic revenue increased 4.8% for the quarter from a ramp on the F-35 as we transitioned from development to production on the next-generation mission systems in our Mission Avionics sector and growth in space from new program wins. This growth was partially reduced by low single-digit decline in our Intel and Cyber due to program timing. For the full year, organic revenue increased 5.8% from the F-35 ramp and classified growth in Intel and Cyber. Space and electronic warfare were down due to in-year program transition, but recent wins position space to be a key growth driver for 2021. Operating income was up 13% in the fourth quarter and 6.8% for the year. And margins expanded 150 basis points to 19.5% for the quarter and 20 basis points to 18.8% for the year. Overall, our space business had a transformative year as we've been awarded contracts within the missile defense area, including the Space Development Agency\u2019s tracking layer, and more recently here in January on the Missile Defense Agency\u2019s hypersonic and ballistic tracking space sensor program, or HBTSS, culminating multiple years of investment in innovation. On HBTSS, our team will develop a prototype satellite that will demonstrate our capability to detect and track hypersonic weapons in space. The initial launch is targeted for 2023 with an opportunity to build out a constellation thereafter. These competitive wins have potential value of over $5 billion, uniquely positioning L3Harris to play a lead role with multiple agencies and mark the culmination of a successful multi-year repositioning strategy, establishing ourselves as a mission solutions prime with our responsive satellites and within missile defense. Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was up 3.4% for the quarter, driven by tactical growth of 17%, that included record international sales up over 30% from the the Mid East and Central Asia and continued DoD modernization. This strength was partially offset by anticipated weakness in our public safety business due to the COVID-19 as well as the decline in integrated vision systems from international program timing. Full year revenue was up 4.4% driven by 13% growth in tactical communications, primarily from the ramp in DoD modernization programs, which also benefited Integrated Vision Solutions. As anticipated, we saw solid international growth of 4% in tactical communications with major wins in Australia, Europe and the Mid East. Total Communication Systems orders in Australia exceeded 200 million with contracts for tactical radios and wave forms, supporting crypto modernization requirements and the Land 53 next-gen night vision goggle program. The 17% decline in PSPC was consistent with our expectations and should ease post the first quarter. Operating income was up 14% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the year. And margins expanded 280 basis points to 25.9% and 200 basis points to 24.4% for the quarter and year respectively. Our Broadband business had a major strategic win, with the prime contract award for the U.S. Navy's next generation jammer, low-band program for nearly $500 million. Highlighting our advanced technology and innovative solutions for the contested environments our customers will need to compete and operate-in, in the future. The program comes with follow-on opportunities in the $4 billion range, demonstrates our standing as a leader in spectrum superiority and electronic warfare for legacy and next-gen platforms. This multi-year pursuit validates our strategy to be a prime and provide leading edge technical solutions to our customers. Finally, in aviation systems, organic revenue decreased 11% in the quarter and 3% for the year as expected due to COVID-19 related impacts in the commercial aviation business. Growth with our U.S. government customers remained healthy in defense avionics from a ramp on classified programs and ground vehicle systems, and mission networks from higher FAA volume. Operating income was down 22% in the fourth quarter and 5.4% for the year, primarily from the sale of our airport security and automation businesses as cost actions and growth in defense aviation and mission networks mitigated our commercial headwinds. Margins were flat at 14.9% in the quarter, full year margins however expanded a 100 basis points to 13.8%. Notable activity in the quarter included $142 million order from the U.S. Space and Missile Systems Center to continue the development of the next gen M-Code GPS receivers with inception to-date awards had over $0.5 billion. Over the last few months, we've successfully positioned ourselves for growth with notable awards that represent opportunities in the multi-billion dollar range. These wins provide a long-term visibility and highlight the strength of our portfolio in a range of budget environments and across multiple domains. With a healthy backlog of $22 billion, that's up nearly 80% for the year adjusting for divestitures and a funded book-to-bill of 1.04 we are confident in the sustainability of our growth. As we think about 2021, we'll continue to execute on our strategic priorities that are focused on growing the top line, advancing the integration, expanding margins through flawless execution and continuous improvement, reshaping our portfolio and maximizing cash flow to support capital returns. With that I'll hand it over to Jay.\nJay Malave: Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. I'll begin with a brief recap of our fourth quarter and 2020 results before shifting over to our 2021 outlook. Fourth quarter, organic revenue was flat, largely driven by the effects of the pandemic and aircraft timing. As our core U.S government business was up about 4%, with the international side up modestly. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 18.5%, primarily from integration benefits, operational excellence and cost management, earnings per share of $11.60 was better than we expected and grew 10% or $0.29 as shown on Slide 9. Of this growth synergies and operations contributed $0.47. Along with a lower share comp of $0.15 which more than compensated for the headwinds from divestitures in pandemic impacted end markets For the full year organic revenue was up 3% with our core U.S. government business up 7% and international up a point. Partially offset by the impact from our commercial businesses due to the pandemic. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 18% and 75 basis points ahead of the midpoint of our initial guide. With the integration benefits, operational excellence and cost management being the primary drivers. Earnings per share grew 13% or $1.34, primarily from operations, synergy benefits and a 4% lower share count, enabling us to deliver on our double-digit growth target. Solid fourth quarter free cash flow of $642 million resulted in the full-year coming in at the upper end of our guidance range. With this cash flow, we repurchased $2.3 billion in stock and paid $725 million in dividends. Okay, now switching over to the 2021 guidance on Slide 10. Starting with the top-line, organic revenue is expected to be up 3% to 5% reflecting growth in every segment with a light first quarter as we lap pandemic-related impacts and phase in new programs. On full year EBIT, we expect total company margins to be 18% to 18.5%, a 25 basis point improvement over the prior year at the midpoint, primarily driven by increased cost synergies, operational excellence and pension, net of mix headwinds from space, IMS and tactical radios. This combined with a 4% lower share count will result in 2021 EPS in the range of $12.60 to $13 per share, up double digits at the midpoint versus 2020. On free cash flow, our guide implies nearly $14 per share at the point and clear traction with our growth framework. This reflects a three-day working capital improvement to 51 days, $375 million in capital expenditures and no pension funding. Our guidance also reflects approximately $2.3 billion in share repurchases, excluding divestitures as part of our recently approved buyback authorization. And following yesterday's announced dividend increase, this'll be our third hike since the merger, representing a cumulative increase of about 50, reflecting our confidence in continued cash generation. All told, we expect to return $3.1 billion to shareholders this year before accounting for any divestiture proceeds that'll be additive. Switching over to the segments, Integrated Mission Systems revenue is expected to be up 4% to 6%. Driven by ISR aircraft missionization demand and maritime from recent wins. Segment operating margin is anticipated to be 15.5% at the midpoint as operational excellence, synergy savings and pension benefits are netted by program mix impacts. In Space and Airborne Systems, we expect organic revenue to be up 4% to 6%, driven by traction and space, and continued classified strength in Intel and cyber. Segment operating margin of 18.5% at the midpoint is driven by mixed headwinds from key growth programs that outweigh E3 productivity, pension and integration benefits. Communication systems revenue is expected to be up 2.5% to 4.5%, from continued modernization growth in DoD tactical, as well as international growth integrated vision solutions. Public safety will have a modest headwind in the year, as COVID related impacts lap in the first quarter of 2021, with a recovery later in the year. Segment margins are anticipated to be 24.5% at the midpoint from operational excellence and synergies, partially offset by product mix within tactical radios. And lastly in Aviation Systems, organic revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3%, driven by continued growth in our U.S. government businesses from a ramp on combat propulsion systems and classified programs, which will be moderated by a slight decrease in commercial aerospace for the year. Segment margins of 14% at the midpoint reflect improvement driven by operational excellence, cost management and synergy savings. Okay. Turning to the EPS slide and bridge on Slide 11, expected full-year EPS of $12.80 at the midpoint reflects 10% growth. Of this, operations and synergies will contribute $0.44, along with a lower share count for $0.57. And pension and other items of $0.26, more than offsetting the $0.07 headwind from completed divestitures. All right, so just putting it all together, 2020 performance is demonstrating the resilience of our earnings and cash generating power and our 2021 outlook reflecting further progress against our financial targets, with recurring double-digit earnings and free cash flow per share growth, driven by rising top line as well as industry leading margins and capital returns. Okay. One last item before getting to your questions, I know there's been interest in a deeper look into our company as well as our growth drivers. So on March 10, we'll start with a virtual business briefing focusing on two of our segments Space and Airborne Systems, and Integrated Mission Systems. That will be followed by a closer look at our other businesses at a later date. Okay. With that operator, let's open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. My apologies. Sheila will continue in just a moment. Please go ahead, Sheila. Your line is open.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Bill, Chris, Jay, your EPS guide is up 10% at the midpoint on a 4% revenue increase. And you announced a fairly hefty dividend increase last night of 20%, but your total deployment is up 8% year-over-year. How do you think about growth in cap deployment from here? How does that tie into your medium-term expectations of EPS and free cash flow per share growth?\nJay Malave: So Sheila, you see what we saw today, what we announced last night on the dividend is where it's as far as well as including our share repurchase today. This is consistent with the framework we've laid out over the past year and a half, which is returning 100% of free cash flow to share owners. You'll see 3.1 is a little bit in excess of that in 2021, but the framework is intact. It's a framework we expect to continue moving forward. As far as the dividend, may be a little more specific, 20% \u2013 we've had the target as Bill mentioned of 30% to 35% in terms of a cash payout ratio in the dividend, and that's still our target. That's something that we'll look to accelerate or continue accelerating the dividend growth over the next few years to get ourselves in that range. And so I would expect it to be more of the same going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nCarter Copeland: Hey, good morning, guys. Just a quick clarification on a comment you made Chris, and then a question. The contract you mentioned in IMS, the air airplane contracts, is there any ongoing risk there if that doesn't get parliamentary approval or I think you said that was just scope. Just trying to get my arms around that one.\nChris Kubasik: Yes. Thanks, Carter. No, the program is in the budget and it's just a process to get through the parliament. What happened was the Air Force in this country wanted to add additional scope to the program and we had planned for a December award. But due to the changes to the contract and the ongoing holidays and the usual delays in that time of year, it's moved into 2021. So we're very confident in this award and it\u2019s just a timing flip.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nBill Brown: Good morning, Rob.\nRobert Stallard: It's either for Bill or for Chris. You obviously talked a lot about the defense exports and your ambition to continue to grow this going forward in 2021 and beyond. But we do have a new U.S. administration. They seem to put a few things on hold. Do you see any implications from this freeze for your export sales this year or into next year?\nBill Brown: Well, thanks for the question. I do think that we'll see in the Biden administration continued support for exports to our partners or allies. I think that's been clearly signaled. We'll see kind of like with the last administration, some clear support there. You may see some more scrutiny in certain regions like in the Middle East, and you saw an announcement come out just a couple of days ago. Frankly, it wasn't necessarily new news, it was well signaled. It\u2019s sort of a standard practice for the start of a new administration to take a pause on some of these more contentious exports of certain countries; so number one. Two, we're not an arms or weapons provider, so I'm not sure it really affects us very much. But when we look at sales into the region in those two countries, net of backlog is less than 1% of our revenue. So it's relatively small. And then third, it's likely just a matter of timing. We think if there's any impact to us at all, it's a matter of timing and we think that'll all come out within 2021. So we think this all settled down relatively quickly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nKristine Liwag: Hey, good morning, guys.\nBill Brown: Good morning.\nKristine Liwag: As you continue to shape your portfolio, can you provide us with an update of what you're viewing as core capabilities versus non-core? And whether or not that's changed with the election results?\nBill Brown: Well, thanks for the question. No, it's not changing. I mean, this is not really driven by who's in the current administration or what's happening in Congress. It really is driven by those businesses which we think that we can better own and drive value to owners that tend to be ones that are more technology intensive businesses that require investment in IRAD and our 20,000 plus engineers to make them better every day to differentiate versus competitors. Those are the kinds of businesses that we want to be in, and the businesses we're looking to get out are non-core, don't necessarily fit that model. We're making progress. We had a good start to early 2020. COVID sort of slowed us down a little bit. We saw some acceleration in Q4. And then certainly January has been pretty busy. It's not going to be a linear journey on divestitures, but we're patient, we're focused. We do still think it will be 8% to 10% of our revenue. And as I and Jay and others have talked about, we'll deploy proceeds back to owners as soon as we make those announcements and we'll talk to investors as those transactions occur.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please proceed with your questions.\nGautam Khanna: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.\nBill Brown: Hey, good morning, Gautam.\nGautam Khanna: So one of the questions we frequently get from investors and I wanted you to respond to it is despite all the revenue synergies and the progress you've shown, there's a perception that legacy Harris comm systems business may not fare so well in a flat to down DoD top line environment. And I wondered if you could just kind of speak to that, how you think night vision, tactical comms, et cetera, some of the shorter cycle that might fare over the next couple of years. And if you could provide some metrics around some of the pipeline pursuits that you're pursuing. Thank you.\nBill Brown: Yes, sure, Gautam. Look, we're a very different business today than we were seven, eight, nine years ago when a lot of the tac comm business was driven by repairs, resets. It really wasn't focused on a program of record, but that's very different today. So it\u2019s really stepping back. And when we think about our company as a whole, we've got total backlog at the end of last year at about 1.2 times our revenue. So it's a little bit less than what we see with our peers. So we're a shorter cycle if you will, but we're not necessarily short cycle. We've got a piece of the business and you hit some of the key ones that radios, night vision goggles, maybe a couple of other spots that are \u2013 that have backlog less than one times revenue. So for those businesses in particular, most of them are on programs of records today. They're well-supported. They're in the early innings of modernization and we feel very good about that. I'll take tactical radio for a minute on the DoD side. As we know, there's 350,000 to 400,000 radios that will be upgraded. There's about 10% of the way through there. You can see in the budget in 2021 continued to be well-supported in terms of revenue, in terms of budget authority for radio monetizations, and we're in the front end of a long modernization curve on tactical radios. The same thing is on the international side. There's more than a dozen countries on our front end of modernization. A lot of it announced a couple of 100,000 radios, $4 billion worth of pipeline. So, again, we're on the front end of modernization ramp on the international side, which is it tends to follow what happens in the U.S. And then you mentioned night vision goggles. We are on a sole source director requirement for ENVG-B. We delivered about 5,000 goggles to-date. We're on a program of record, which was announced in September, which we're one of the awardees for that, 100,000 plus night vision goggles. So we're 5% of the way through, again, with very clear budget visibility. So when you look at where we're at our modernization and visibility into the budgets, we think the outlook is very, very positive for all of those \u201cshorter cycle businesses\u201d, Gautam.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\nNoah Poponak: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nBill Brown: Hey, good morning, Noah.\nNoah Poponak: Hey, Jay, just wanted to try to better understand the cash flow progression. In thinking through 2020, there's a few hundred million of adjusted net income growth, which I think gets all the non-cash out. The deck sites eight days of working capital, which using the number you guys used to quote for per day, that's a sizeable increase. I think he had a deferred cash tax. So I'm surprised that that the 2020 final free cash was only up $200 million. Maybe you can help me square up what I'm missing there. And then if you could then just carry into 2021, helping us understand the major moving pieces in the cash flow bridge that are outside of the business guidance you've given.\nJay Malave: Sure. Thanks for the question, Noah. Sure. In 2020, at the end of 2020, we accelerated \u2013 we continue to accelerate payments to small suppliers. Total impact, most of which was most suppliers is about 100,000 million of outflow. Say the other piece of it was just a little bit of timing issue between cash taxes. And so there was some timing of cash that was more in 2020 that was paid versus what we'd originally expected that will be a benefit in 2021. So those are the two primary drivers of 2020. In 2021, as I mentioned, we're relying on three days of working capital. We'll also get a benefit from these cash tax a little bit better than we expected. And those are really the two major drivers. And just speaking, going back to working capital, we continue to drive while it's three days our opportunity set is substantially bigger than that. So there's runway beyond 2020, even in \u2013 sorry, 2021, even in 2021, where our projects are by our sectors, by our segments are pretty well-defined particularly in inventory. And we've got a really nice I think a roadmap to deliver 2021 and beyond going forward. And so, these I'd say the moving pieces are not much different from what we've talked about in the past, really focused on working capital to make that not a use of cash and could make it either neutral or a source of cash and dropping through the net income. In 2021, as I mentioned, we\u2019ll get a little bit of a tax benefit, but really kind of set the stage for continued cash flow growth beyond 2021 as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.\nRichard Safran: Thanks. Bill, Chris, Jay, Rajeev, good morning. How are you?\nBill Brown: Hey, good morning.\nRichard Safran: So, at IMS, you noted strong Maritime sales in 4Q. You had a ramp in manned and classified programs. You also mentioned it. I believe in your opening remarks about a driver of 2021. So I'm interested in if you could comment a bit more in more detail about sales and margin growth in that business in 2021 and maybe even in longer term. In your answer could you also comment on classified versus unclassified program growth?\nBill Brown: So, I'll start that and maybe Chris can jump in on that. Look, Richard, the Maritime business has been a real strong performer for us in 2020. We have a good leadership. There was lots of pieces that were well integrated together. We're not completely through all that, but we're making really good progress. 2020 was a very strong year, was up double digits. The orders were really strong. Book-to-bill came in above 1, factored reasonably above 1, and we see continued growth in calendar 2021. We're calling it mid single-digit range, but lots of good indicators of continued growth there. We just have a very solid position. We do a lot of work on power conversion, power distribution, towed arrays, mass, sonars, crypto, a bunch of different things. And we've got a great position on the unmanned side as well. So it's pretty broad base. It's across both the OEM and service U.S. international, so \u2013 in manned and unmanned. So we liked the position that we happen to have. On the manned side, we've got good content on both Columbia and Virginia. Those programs are well-supported and Chris talked about the future frigate with Fincantieri. We've got a very strong position in content on the future frigate. Those all look really good and well-supported. And on the unmanned side, I think we're on the front end of this. It's not a big part of the business today, but it's growing. We're the only prime of any unmanned maritime vessel here for the U.S. Navy is the MUSV or the Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicle. We're the prime on that. That\u2019s a pretty good contract we're executing on. We've got a study on the LUSV, which is the Large Unmanned Surface Vessel. We're doing mine counter-measure systems. I think we talked about in a press release about a Phase 2 with \u2013 in Europe, with a partner where we're providing substantial content for unmanned manned \u2013 unmanned mind counter countermeasures systems and then all the underwater side. Really can't talk about the \u2013 on the classified business, but we've got a very strong position on undersea classified capabilities as well. So overall a very good business, with the hope and the direction we'd likely see in the budget of more growth focused on the Navy given where the future threats happened to be. I don\u2019t know, Chris, if I missed anything in that.\nChris Kubasik: No, I think you got a good summary. I'll also say the future continues to be bright. I mean, we have to execute on all the programs that we just talked about. But just looking ahead to 2021, the Navy is looking at a couple of programs called spectral, spear and spatial, and these are all integrated signal intelligence programs, sensor to shooter, those types of things. They're under an overall umbrella that does maybe referred to as Overwatch. So if you kind of think of that as the Navy's equivalent of the AVMs equivalent. So, we were excited about those opportunities. And as I said in my remarks, both as a system integrator or a prime we're well-positioned. And then of course, internationally, we're getting a lot of interest of supporting OEMs as they take their business abroad. So it's been a good run and the future remains bright for Maritime.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nBill Brown: Good morning, David.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning, David.\nDavid Strauss: Bill and Chris, I guess, when the merger was announced, the management transition I think was Bill, you were going to be CEO for two years, and then Chris was going to take over. And I think that puts us \u2013 that plan in place happening kind of second half of this year. Is that still what we should expect or is there been any sort of a change there? Thanks.\nBill Brown: So, David, thank you. No, it's exactly the plan that we're working towards. It's the end of Q2. It's got a date and a time because it's written in a merger agreement and you're working towards that. I think more broadly, let nudges what's in the agreement is, is the partnership that I have with Chris and we're working with Jay, we've got a great leadership team. We're working well together. We're executing well on our strategy. We're aligned on the direction we're taking in the company. And you'll hear and see more of that in the investor briefing we're going to have in March, where Chris will talk a little bit about thoughts on becoming moving more towards emission solutions provider. As you see here, Ed and Sean talking about their businesses as well, but tracking well, performing well, and we're not expecting any sort of strategic redirection ready bump in the performance of the company.\nChris Kubasik: And I'll just chime in. I know a lot of people ask is the strategy going to change when you change the leader and that's not the case. So clearly we've been working this together for over two years, there'll be a smooth transition because Bill will remain in the exact chair for an additional year. So I don't see any big surprises coming. We've laid out pretty clearly our focus on the growth and the integration and the margin expansion and the cash flow. So we'll be in good shape. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Arment: Thanks. Good morning, Bill, Chris, Jay. Bill or Chris, I guess I just want to talk \u2013 bask about the synergy targets and performance in the quarter was really impressive. You guys beat I think your target for 2020 by 11% and have raised the longer-term target now. Can you just describe a little bit where you're seeing these gains? Is it just across the board from your E3 efforts? Maybe just some color there that'd be helpful. Thanks.\nBill Brown: So thanks for the question. No, it's different than E3. E3 is additive to the synergy targets. So now, we had a really good year. The team is performing, very, very well. I talked a little bit about some of the drivers of the outperformance this year and why we took up our number to next year at $320 million to $350 million, which again is well above what we thought we would do in three years. And we are now doing more than that in two. So we're seeing a lot more opportunities in supply chain, we're still working through our facility rationalization, very, very good progress, substantial activities happening over the course of 2021. It has been very, very well and closely managed and monitored. It's going to execute very well. And we're seeing good opportunities are coming through there. Functional efficiencies, shared services, we just keep seeing more and more opportunities to get better. That's the spirit of continuous improvement. That's really, what's behind E3. That's why we think as we wrap up integration at the back end of 2021. And then in 2022, we really talk about it less as integration more as just productivity and operational excellence. We're going to have a good year in 2021, those are the things that drive it, so team is just executing very, very well.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning.\nBill Brown: Good morning.\nMyles Walton: Two quick ones, maybe on IMS, obviously the sales didn't quite come through on the time you expect it. I'm just curious, Chris, if it's just a slip of timing, why 2021\u2019s growth isn't more significant. It seems like, kind of the $200 million or $150 million slipped would jolt up that growth rate. And then secondarily I think the F-35 in the avionics business in particular is where one of the biggest contributors of 2020 growth. What does that look like in 2021? Thanks.\nChris Kubasik: Yes. Thanks, Myles. On IMS side I can see where you'd draw that conclusion. We're still looking 4% to 6%, the initial guidance early in the year for IMS. And it really comes down to the number of aircraft that you can induct in the factory in any one year. So, I think of it as maybe some of that 2020 slides to 2021, the latter part of 2021 slides into 2022, if that makes sense. So we're not losing anything. It just kind of slipped out to the right. And then on F-35 and mission avionics, we have multiple systems that we're providing to Lockheed as you well know, especially on the \u2013 what we're calling TR3 the Tech Refresh 3. So we're going through a transition from development to production. We think longer-term there's numerous opportunities for additional content that we could provide, but not withstanding that as the aircrafts ramp up, we get more content per plane and even the potential for sustainment. We see this as a long-term growth driver for years to come, not to mention the international opportunities on top of that.\nMyles Walton: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.\nJon Raviv: Thanks and good morning. You sort of given the divestitures and also the pandemic impact on commercial in 2020 is a bit of an easy comp into 2021. And then with the commercial in 1Q still being light 2021 is still kind of setting a relatively easy comp as well. So can you talk about just the opportunities for growth rates to actually potentially accelerate beyond 2021, even slightly as you get over the commercial aero comp, these new space activities ramp up, the revenue synergies pick up. And then also within that portfolio, what might be sort of heading in the wrong direction versus what's heading the right direction to sort of maintain at least mid-single digit growth.\nBill Brown: So, Jon I think that's a good question. I think you laid out, kind of the response and the question, if you will. So you laid out some of the drivers next year. Yes, we do see \u2013 as I made that in my remarks, DoD in U.S. government low-single digits, we see revenue synergies about a point, we see international mid-single digit plus, some headwinds coming from commercial, but you're exactly right. As you start to get out into 2022 from 2021, we'll see less of it, maybe no commercial headwinds and maybe eventually starts to turn into a tailwind. We see international as a front-end of a build. Again, we're very under penetrated. We have 20% of our revenues in international and Chris laid out a growth target there. We performed very well in the back half of last year. It was up low-to-mid single digits. We had a very good Q3. And we've got some good momentum coming into this year, a very big pipeline, of our $67 billion total company pipeline $16 billion of which is an international. So we've got a lot of opportunities, we're chasing on the international front. And again, we've talked about the revenue synergies, about a point call it $150 million to $200 million net incremental in 2021 from 2020 we're still at the front end of the build. So we have 40 proposals that have been awarded. We won two-thirds of them, but there's 70 that are submitted so another 30 to be awarded or not. There's more that are happening in the future. So we hope to continue to build on that. And we do hope, just given the positioning of ourselves within the DoD budget, then low single digit growth from DoD could actually grow over time, because we're in great places that we are going to continue to get funded, but we're also growing as a mission solutions provider going after a larger addressable market. So, put all those pieces together, that should \u2013 that could drive acceleration beyond 2021. But right now we're laying out the 2021 framework and we are already thinking about mid-single digits beyond that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Seifman: Okay. Thanks very much, and good morning everyone.\nBill Brown: Good morning, Seth.\nSeth Seifman: I think, Bill, you talked in the past about getting DoD tactical to sort of $1 billion \u2013 over $1 billion of sales in the early 2020 time frame and kind of got right up to that $1 billion level in 2020. And so, I guess is there anything more specific you can say to kind of outline the outlook there over the next couple of years?\nBill Brown: So Seth that's a good question, in fact I remember the discussion from a few years ago about getting to $1 billion. And frankly, it happened a little bit sooner than we had even anticipated at that point in time. So we were just a tad under that last year. With our guidance, we'll be at or above \u2013 it will be above $1 billion this year. We're just very well-positioned across the tactical radio business, as you know. We're across all the services, across all the contract vehicles, very strong position and the Marine Corps was a big driver of us in 2020. We're sole-sourced on HF radios. We're sole-sourced there on Manpack. We'll compete on the handheld this year. We're sole-sourced across SOCOM. Army, we compete versus Thales and Collins. But the fact is I think given the momentum that we have here, we see continued share gains within those areas as well within the army. So, I think we're well positioned. The budgets are very supportive. When you look at all tactical radio in total in 2021 over 2020, the budgets themselves are up about 25%. HMS is up 16%, 17%. So there's very good continued budget coverage here. We're starting the year with mid-single-digit growth in DoD. We're coming off a very strong 2020 and an even stronger 2019. So maybe, hopefully, there's some conservatism built into that. But there's some competition happening this year, and we'll keep evaluating and updating investors through the year on just our progress in DoD. But frankly, the team has done a great job in positioning ourselves for success in tactical over a multiyear period.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nRon Epstein: Yes. Hi, good morning guys.\nBill Brown: Good morning.\nRon Epstein: Could you \u2013 with the change in administration, can you talk about \u2013 I mean, every defense company tends to say we're well positioned for the change. And everyone can't possibly be, right? I mean, that's just impossible. Where do you expect to see weaknesses because of the change? Where do you expect to see strength? And then, where are you positioned the best for the change in administration?\nBill Brown: So I'll start there. Maybe Jay and Chris can jump in. Look, I think there's going to be continued focus on the space domain, which we have spent a number of years repositioning the company to go after. Last year, it was a softer year. It was a transition year. We had a couple of program transitions. But you see in Q4, we came back very, very strongly. We're up high-single digits. We'll be up high single digits in 2021. We've got good wins. I mean, Chris walked through some of the key ones there. And frankly, that's just going to be continuing to be a growth area. And you heard some of the commentary, from Secretary Austin's commentary at his hearing about the focus on space and it's not just across DoD, there's a lot of classified community investments going on in the space. So I think, number one, we've got a really good position there going from components to systems, and I think a proven strategy. I think some of the things that's happening on the unmanned side are opportunities for the future, both on maritime as well as on the airborne side. We've got really strong positions in both sides. I think that's going to continue to be well-funded. At the end of the day, any fight in the future particularly against these near-peer competitors will require network platforms and not just simply platform improvements themselves, so how they work together. That requires resilient communications. Strong, secure, non-jammable resilient communications, and that is the sweet spot of the company. We keep talking about that. It's very, very important. And there's really no one that's better positioned to enable that JADC2 mission environment than where we happen to be. That's why we're on all of the ABMS contract vehicles, I think we've just had a great position there. That's going to continue to be well supported. So those are the areas that I think are going to be where we're best positioned. And I know what everyone else is talking about. We're sitting here with almost 4% of our revenue in IRAD. We're focusing our company. We've got a very unique situation with this merger where we can start off with a clean sheet and get all of our segments built from the day one to collaborate together, and that's why we're seeing traction here on the revenue synergies. So you put all those pieces together, and that's why I do believe that we've got just a strong powerful portfolio of businesses with good leadership that should outgrow our competitors into the future.\nChris Kubasik: And I'll just chime in. Some of the tradeoffs, obviously, are going to be the force structure versus modernization. And then the modernization is it going to be new platforms or upgrading existing platforms and then, there's always the focus on strategic deterrence. So the types of systems and the type of capabilities we have across all domains, I think position us well, there was a question earlier about our content on F-35 as an example, but we're also well positioned on next-generation opportunities. So we can support the upgrades and enhancements to existing systems. I look at what we have in EW. We have five LOAs signed with international countries, for F-16. Modernization is an example. We're on the Columbia class as a strategic deterrent. There's talk about \u2013 next about the nuclear command and control aircraft recapitalization, which again is in our sweet spot. So when you look across the spectrum, space, EW, cyber, ISR, resilient comms, whether we're a prime or a sub, new systems, old systems, I really like where we are. So, thanks for the question, Ron.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed with your question.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes. Good morning.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning, George.\nGeorge Shapiro: Chris, I just want a little more explanation similar to what you gave Myles on IMS and the SAS sector, because there, you were a little bit short as well in terms of the expectation of 7% growth for the year. You mentioned Intel and Cyber due to program timing, if you could just give some more color on where the shortfall there was.\nChris Kubasik: Yes, George, great question, I probably should have elaborated on that. It was really the timing of awards. I mentioned, HBTSS and SDA and some of the classified wins. They took a little longer to get under contract. Or, candidly, some of these were pro-tested and then it caused the delays. So we just saw a slip from the fourth quarter, if you will of 2020 into early 2021. You can't get the contract. You can't get the revenue to get started. So that was just a clear slip from 2020 to 2021 due to timing of those. Intel and Cyber, not too lumpy of a business but nothing to be concerned with there, in fact, when you look at that whole business it\u2019s close to $1 billion, we're seeing growth in 2021 there as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. And maybe just back to where Ron was going. A quick one, can you guys \u2013 do you think you can grow the backlog in 2021? And then just looking at that positioning, I think historically, DoD revenues were about 35% tied to O&M exposure. And then, you obviously got some army exposure. But, do you think with the administration change, you're confident in this growth trajectory. Assuming, maybe those prior two would be bill payers? Can you drive enough growth out of maybe air force and space? And maybe even kind of the commercial space to offset some of those O&M and army headwinds if they materialize?\nBill Brown: Yes. So, Michael, just very quickly, on Land it's about 20% of our revenue, and it's well supported programs. A lot of its ISR aircraft that we feel very confident it's going to continue. On the service mix, yes, there is going to be kind of a tilt toward sea, air, space center-type platforms in a near-peer competition that's hearing a lot coming out of the navy, and I talked a lot about what's happening with the air force and the space force. So in a flat to declining budget environment, I think there's general speculation, army will be a bill payer here for us. The army is only about 10% of our revenue. It's smaller part of what we do even with the DoD. It's, I think, between the navy and the air force, it's about four times what the army happens to be. So it's not a big part of the company. I think, we are more predisposed to the air force was our biggest customer. And the navy, we spent a lot of time talking about some of the maritime opportunities here. So we think the shift is actually favorable to us. We think we're well-positioned there. And we think we can manage through those shifts happening right now between the services. So we like where we are. We like the positioning of our portfolio. And then, by the way, in 2021, we do think we can build the backlog because we'll see book-to-bill more than one. So, we think that will continue to grow into next year.\nBill Brown: So look, that wraps us up here today. Thank you very much. We had a strong solid year. It was a tough backdrop. And I want to thank again our employees for executing well on our strategic priorities, delivering value to our customers and our shareholders, but also providing a solid foundation to build on in 2021 as well as the medium-term. Again, thank you for joining the call this morning. And we look forward to speaking with you more, at our upcoming investor briefing on March 10. Thank you very much, everybody. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Chris Kubasik",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Bill, and good morning, everyone. Let's go to Slide 5. Integrated Mission Systems fourth quarter revenue was flat. Strong growth in our Maritime business continued as a result of several key wins during the year. We were awarded prime contracts for the medium unmanned surface vehicle program and the classified undersea acoustic systems program, which alongside an important win on the U.S. Navy frigate program, affirms our strategy to establish ourselves as both a prime contractor and a systems integrator. This progress was offset by a moderate decline in electro-optical due to program timing and an ISR due to aircraft timing. Our prior guidance assumed a December contract for ISR aircraft from an international customer that was delayed due to the customer's decision to expand the program. We are now awaiting parliamentary approval for that program. For the full year, revenue was up 3.3% from double-digit growth in Maritime and low single-digit growth in ISR. Operating income was up 7.2% in the fourth quarter and 21% for the year. And margins expanded 100 basis points to 14.3% and 230 basis points to 15.3% for the quarter in year, respectively. Our ISR business made significant progress on its international strategy with a contract to provide missionized ISR aircraft for the Canadian Air Force, capabilities on a Maritime patrol aircraft for a customer in the Asia-Pacific region and the introduction of potted SIGINT capability for unmanned aircraft for deployment in Europe and Asia. We have a strong pipeline as our allies appreciate the need for situational awareness that our systems provide. In Space and Airborne Systems, organic revenue increased 4.8% for the quarter from a ramp on the F-35 as we transitioned from development to production on the next-generation mission systems in our Mission Avionics sector and growth in space from new program wins. This growth was partially reduced by low single-digit decline in our Intel and Cyber due to program timing. For the full year, organic revenue increased 5.8% from the F-35 ramp and classified growth in Intel and Cyber. Space and electronic warfare were down due to in-year program transition, but recent wins position space to be a key growth driver for 2021. Operating income was up 13% in the fourth quarter and 6.8% for the year. And margins expanded 150 basis points to 19.5% for the quarter and 20 basis points to 18.8% for the year. Overall, our space business had a transformative year as we've been awarded contracts within the missile defense area, including the Space Development Agency's tracking layer, and more recently here in January on the Missile Defense Agency's hypersonic and ballistic tracking space sensor program, or HBTSS, culminating multiple years of investment in innovation. On HBTSS, our team will develop a prototype satellite that will demonstrate our capability to detect and track hypersonic weapons in space. The initial launch is targeted for 2023 with an opportunity to build out a constellation thereafter. These competitive wins have potential value of over $5 billion, uniquely positioning L3Harris to play a lead role with multiple agencies and mark the culmination of a successful multi-year repositioning strategy, establishing ourselves as a mission solutions prime with our responsive satellites and within missile defense. Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was up 3.4% for the quarter, driven by tactical growth of 17%, that included record international sales up over 30% from the the Mid East and Central Asia and continued DoD modernization. This strength was partially offset by anticipated weakness in our public safety business due to the COVID-19 as well as the decline in integrated vision systems from international program timing. Full year revenue was up 4.4% driven by 13% growth in tactical communications, primarily from the ramp in DoD modernization programs, which also benefited Integrated Vision Solutions. As anticipated, we saw solid international growth of 4% in tactical communications with major wins in Australia, Europe and the Mid East. Total Communication Systems orders in Australia exceeded 200 million with contracts for tactical radios and wave forms, supporting crypto modernization requirements and the Land 53 next-gen night vision goggle program. The 17% decline in PSPC was consistent with our expectations and should ease post the first quarter. Operating income was up 14% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the year. And margins expanded 280 basis points to 25.9% and 200 basis points to 24.4% for the quarter and year respectively. Our Broadband business had a major strategic win, with the prime contract award for the U.S. Navy's next generation jammer, low-band program for nearly $500 million. Highlighting our advanced technology and innovative solutions for the contested environments our customers will need to compete and operate-in, in the future. The program comes with follow-on opportunities in the $4 billion range, demonstrates our standing as a leader in spectrum superiority and electronic warfare for legacy and next-gen platforms. This multi-year pursuit validates our strategy to be a prime and provide leading edge technical solutions to our customers. Finally, in aviation systems, organic revenue decreased 11% in the quarter and 3% for the year as expected due to COVID-19 related impacts in the commercial aviation business. Growth with our U.S. government customers remained healthy in defense avionics from a ramp on classified programs and ground vehicle systems, and mission networks from higher FAA volume. Operating income was down 22% in the fourth quarter and 5.4% for the year, primarily from the sale of our airport security and automation businesses as cost actions and growth in defense aviation and mission networks mitigated our commercial headwinds. Margins were flat at 14.9% in the quarter, full year margins however expanded a 100 basis points to 13.8%. Notable activity in the quarter included $142 million order from the U.S. Space and Missile Systems Center to continue the development of the next gen M-Code GPS receivers with inception to-date awards had over $0.5 billion. Over the last few months, we've successfully positioned ourselves for growth with notable awards that represent opportunities in the multi-billion dollar range. These wins provide a long-term visibility and highlight the strength of our portfolio in a range of budget environments and across multiple domains. With a healthy backlog of $22 billion, that's up nearly 80% for the year adjusting for divestitures and a funded book-to-bill of 1.04 we are confident in the sustainability of our growth. As we think about 2021, we'll continue to execute on our strategic priorities that are focused on growing the top line, advancing the integration, expanding margins through flawless execution and continuous improvement, reshaping our portfolio and maximizing cash flow to support capital returns. With that I'll hand it over to Jay. Yes. Thanks, Carter. No, the program is in the budget and it's just a process to get through the parliament. What happened was the Air Force in this country wanted to add additional scope to the program and we had planned for a December award. But due to the changes to the contract and the ongoing holidays and the usual delays in that time of year, it's moved into 2021. So we're very confident in this award and it's just a timing flip. No, I think you got a good summary. I'll also say the future continues to be bright. I mean, we have to execute on all the programs that we just talked about. But just looking ahead to 2021, the Navy is looking at a couple of programs called spectral, spear and spatial, and these are all integrated signal intelligence programs, sensor to shooter, those types of things. They're under an overall umbrella that does maybe referred to as Overwatch. So if you kind of think of that as the Navy's equivalent of the AVMs equivalent. So, we were excited about those opportunities. And as I said in my remarks, both as a system integrator or a prime we're well-positioned. And then of course, internationally, we're getting a lot of interest of supporting OEMs as they take their business abroad. So it's been a good run and the future remains bright for Maritime. Good morning, David. And I'll just chime in. I know a lot of people ask is the strategy going to change when you change the leader and that's not the case. So clearly we've been working this together for over two years, there'll be a smooth transition because Bill will remain in the exact chair for an additional year. So I don't see any big surprises coming. We've laid out pretty clearly our focus on the growth and the integration and the margin expansion and the cash flow. So we'll be in good shape. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Myles. On IMS side I can see where you'd draw that conclusion. We're still looking 4% to 6%, the initial guidance early in the year for IMS. And it really comes down to the number of aircraft that you can induct in the factory in any one year. So, I think of it as maybe some of that 2020 slides to 2021, the latter part of 2021 slides into 2022, if that makes sense. So we're not losing anything. It just kind of slipped out to the right. And then on F-35 and mission avionics, we have multiple systems that we're providing to Lockheed as you well know, especially on the \u2013 what we're calling TR3 the Tech Refresh 3. So we're going through a transition from development to production.

            "content": "Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. I'll begin with a brief recap of our fourth quarter and 2020 results before shifting over to our 2021 outlook. Fourth quarter, organic revenue was flat, largely driven by the effects of the pandemic and aircraft timing. As our core U.S government business was up about 4%, with the international side up modestly. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 18.5%, primarily from integration benefits, operational excellence and cost management, earnings per share of $11.60 was better than we expected and grew 10% or $0.29 as shown on Slide 9. Of this growth synergies and operations contributed $0.47. Along with a lower share comp of $0.15 which more than compensated for the headwinds from divestitures in pandemic impacted end markets For the full year organic revenue was up 3% with our core U.S. government business up 7% and international up a point. Partially offset by the impact from our commercial businesses due to the pandemic. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 18% and 75 basis points ahead of the midpoint of our initial guide. With the integration benefits, operational excellence and cost management being the primary drivers. Earnings per share grew 13% or $1.34, primarily from operations, synergy benefits and a 4% lower share count, enabling us to deliver on our double-digit growth target. Solid fourth quarter free cash flow of $642 million resulted in the full-year coming in at the upper end of our guidance range. With this cash flow, we repurchased $2.3 billion in stock and paid $725 million in dividends. Okay, now switching over to the 2021 guidance on Slide 10. Starting with the top-line, organic revenue is expected to be up 3% to 5% reflecting growth in every segment with a light first quarter as we lap pandemic-related impacts and phase in new programs. On full year EBIT, we expect total company margins to be 18% to 18.5%, a 25 basis point improvement over the prior year at the midpoint, primarily driven by increased cost synergies, operational excellence and pension, net of mix headwinds from space, IMS and tactical radios. This combined with a 4% lower share count will result in 2021 EPS in the range of $12.60 to $13 per share, up double digits at the midpoint versus 2020. On free cash flow, our guide implies nearly $14 per share at the point and clear traction with our growth framework. This reflects a three-day working capital improvement to 51 days, $375 million in capital expenditures and no pension funding. Our guidance also reflects approximately $2.3 billion in share repurchases, excluding divestitures as part of our recently approved buyback authorization. And following yesterday's announced dividend increase, this'll be our third hike since the merger, representing a cumulative increase of about 50, reflecting our confidence in continued cash generation. All told, we expect to return $3.1 billion to shareholders this year before accounting for any divestiture proceeds that'll be additive. Switching over to the segments, Integrated Mission Systems revenue is expected to be up 4% to 6%. Driven by ISR aircraft missionization demand and maritime from recent wins. Segment operating margin is anticipated to be 15.5% at the midpoint as operational excellence, synergy savings and pension benefits are netted by program mix impacts. In Space and Airborne Systems, we expect organic revenue to be up 4% to 6%, driven by traction and space, and continued classified strength in Intel and cyber. Segment operating margin of 18.5% at the midpoint is driven by mixed headwinds from key growth programs that outweigh E3 productivity, pension and integration benefits. Communication systems revenue is expected to be up 2.5% to 4.5%, from continued modernization growth in DoD tactical, as well as international growth integrated vision solutions. Public safety will have a modest headwind in the year, as COVID related impacts lap in the first quarter of 2021, with a recovery later in the year. Segment margins are anticipated to be 24.5% at the midpoint from operational excellence and synergies, partially offset by product mix within tactical radios. And lastly in Aviation Systems, organic revenue is expected to be up 1% to 3%, driven by continued growth in our U.S. government businesses from a ramp on combat propulsion systems and classified programs, which will be moderated by a slight decrease in commercial aerospace for the year. Segment margins of 14% at the midpoint reflect improvement driven by operational excellence, cost management and synergy savings. Okay. Turning to the EPS slide and bridge on Slide 11, expected full-year EPS of $12.80 at the midpoint reflects 10% growth. Of this, operations and synergies will contribute $0.44, along with a lower share count for $0.57. And pension and other items of $0.26, more than offsetting the $0.07 headwind from completed divestitures. All right, so just putting it all together, 2020 performance is demonstrating the resilience of our earnings and cash generating power and our 2021 outlook reflecting further progress against our financial targets, with recurring double-digit earnings and free cash flow per share growth, driven by rising top line as well as industry leading margins and capital returns. Okay. One last item before getting to your questions, I know there's been interest in a deeper look into our company as well as our growth drivers. So on March 10, we'll start with a virtual business briefing focusing on two of our segments Space and Airborne Systems, and Integrated Mission Systems. That will be followed by a closer look at our other businesses at a later date. Okay. With that operator, let's open up the line for questions. So Sheila, you see what we saw today, what we announced last night on the dividend is where it's as far as well as including our share repurchase today. This is consistent with the framework we've laid out over the past year and a half, which is returning 100% of free cash flow to share owners. You'll see 3.1 is a little bit in excess of that in 2021, but the framework is intact. It's a framework we expect to continue moving forward. As far as the dividend, may be a little more specific, 20% \u2013 we've had the target as Bill mentioned of 30% to 35% in terms of a cash payout ratio in the dividend, and that's still our target. That's something that we'll look to accelerate or continue accelerating the dividend growth over the next few years to get ourselves in that range. And so I would expect it to be more of the same going forward. Sure. Thanks for the question, Noah. Sure. In 2020, at the end of 2020, we accelerated \u2013 we continue to accelerate payments to small suppliers. Total impact, most of which was most suppliers is about 100,000 million of outflow. Say the other piece of it was just a little bit of timing issue between cash taxes. And so there was some timing of cash that was more in 2020 that was paid versus what we'd originally expected that will be a benefit in 2021. So those are the two primary drivers of 2020. In 2021, as I mentioned, we're relying on three days of working capital. We'll also get a benefit from these cash tax a little bit better than we expected. And those are really the two major drivers. And just speaking, going back to working capital, we continue to drive while it's three days our opportunity set is substantially bigger than that. So there's runway beyond 2020, even in \u2013 sorry, 2021, even in 2021, where our projects are by our sectors, by our segments are pretty well-defined particularly in inventory. And we've got a really nice I think a roadmap to deliver 2021 and beyond going forward. And so, these I'd say the moving pieces are not much different from what we've talked about in the past, really focused on working capital to make that not a use of cash and could make it either neutral or a source of cash and dropping through the net income. In 2021, as I mentioned, we'll get a little bit of a tax benefit, but really kind of set the stage for continued cash flow growth beyond 2021 as well."

            "name": "Bill Brown",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today we've reported fourth quarter results, and I'd like to start by thanking our employees for their continued dedication and perseverance through 2020. Despite COVID, we've met customer commitments, advance the integration and deliver bottom-line results ahead of initial expectations all while keeping our workforce safe. We'll continue to follow mitigation plans implemented at the onset of the pandemic and keep them in place until widespread vaccinations have occurred. As a combined company, we're successfully executing the strategy we laid out a year and a half ago to drive shareholder value, and our progress is reflected in our operating results and outlook. First, we delivered solid results in 2020, where we exceeded our initial guidance on margins, earnings per share and free cash flow, offsetting the negative impacts of the pandemic with a solid 7% growth in our core U.S. government business and modest growth on the international side. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 18% from synergies and operational excellence and drove earnings per share up 13% consistent with our double-digit growth framework. With an eight-day improvement in working capital, we also generated strong free cash flow of nearly $2.7 billion. This along with progress on portfolio shaping enabled us to return $3 billion to shareholders and deliver growth and free cash flow per share of over 10%. Second, our guidance for the current year shows continued momentum in the business. With the fiscal 2021 budget now set and broad program support across key areas, we're in a position to deliver mid single-digit organic revenue growth at the midpoint, underpinned by the building blocks we previously described. Our DoD portfolio is well aligned with national security priorities. And while the overall budget is flat, we expect at least low single-digit growth driven by space, maritime, DoD modernization in classified programs. Revenue synergies will contribute about a point of growth with the notable driver being the SDA tracking layer award, as well as continued traction elsewhere with a win rate of about two-thirds of the 40 proposals awarded to-date. On the international front, we expect another \u2013 about another point from mid single-digit growth plus backed by a funded book-to-bill of above 1 in 2020 and a growing pipeline of pursuits. And then finally in our commercial businesses, we foresee a more modest impact of full year results as we lap COVID pressures following the first quarter. We also expect another year margin expansion supported by increased synergies and continued operational excellence, net of dilution from new program starts. We exited the year at $270 million in net cumulative synergy savings, $20 million ahead of our prior estimate. And with more confidence in savings from the supply chain, facility rationalization, shared services and functional efficiencies, we're now increasing our cumulative savings to $320 million to $350 million in 2021, up from a prior estimate of $300 million plus and still a year ahead of schedule. Our free cash flow guide of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion demonstrates clear progress towards our $3 billion target in 2022 with all cash use for capital returns to support double-digit earnings and free cash flow per share growth. Yesterday, we announced that our Board approved a new $6 billion share repurchase authorization alongside a 20% increase in our dividend, the third raise since we closed and bringing us closer to our target of a 30% to 35% payout of free cash flow. And then finally, we continue to position the business for long-term value creation by exiting non-core businesses and focusing our significant R&D investment on more strategic, technology-based business areas. We're now in the latter stages of several portfolio shaping processes, and we'll look to provide updates over the coming months. Our expectation continues to be for divestitures to represent a cumulative 8% to 10% of revenue with about a third completed to-date and all proceeds going towards repurchases. And we'll continue to sustain R&D spending at a peer high of nearly 4% of revenue with a focus on open architecture, multifunction software defined solutions across our broad C5ISR portfolio of capabilities. These technologies are essential to countering near peer threats across all domains and our past investments with a driver behind the recent SDA tracking layer, HBTSS, and next-gen jammer wins. So overall, we're clearly making progress in building a high-performance, technology-focused operating company and positioning L3Harris as a full end-to-end mission solutions prime. And with that, let me turn it over to you, Chris. Good morning, Rob. Well, thanks for the question. I do think that we'll see in the Biden administration continued support for exports to our partners or allies. I think that's been clearly signaled. We'll see kind of like with the last administration, some clear support there. You may see some more scrutiny in certain regions like in the Middle East, and you saw an announcement come out just a couple of days ago. Frankly, it wasn't necessarily new news, it was well signaled. It's sort of a standard practice for the start of a new administration to take a pause on some of these more contentious exports of certain countries; so number one. Two, we're not an arms or weapons provider, so I'm not sure it really affects us very much. But when we look at sales into the region in those two countries, net of backlog is less than 1% of our revenue. So it's relatively small. And then third, it's likely just a matter of timing. We think if there's any impact to us at all, it's a matter of timing and we think that'll all come out within 2021. So we think this all settled down relatively quickly. Good morning. Well, thanks for the question. No, it's not changing. I mean, this is not really driven by who's in the current administration or what's happening in Congress. It really is driven by those businesses which we think that we can better own and drive value to owners that tend to be ones that are more technology intensive businesses that require investment in IRAD and our 20,000 plus engineers to make them better every day to differentiate versus competitors. Those are the kinds of businesses that we want to be in, and the businesses we're looking to get out are non-core, don't necessarily fit that model. We're making progress. We had a good start to early 2020. COVID sort of slowed us down a little bit. We saw some acceleration in Q4. And then certainly January has been pretty busy. It's not going to be a linear journey on divestitures, but we're patient, we're focused. We do still think it will be 8% to 10% of our revenue. And as I and Jay and others have talked about, we'll deploy proceeds back to owners as soon as we make those announcements and we'll talk to investors as those transactions occur. Hey, good morning, Gautam. Yes, sure, Gautam. Look, we're a very different business today than we were seven, eight, nine years ago when a lot of the tac comm business was driven by repairs, resets. It really wasn't focused on a program of record, but that's very different today. So it's really stepping back. And when we think about our company as a whole, we've got total backlog at the end of last year at about 1.2 times our revenue. So it's a little bit less than what we see with our peers. So we're a shorter cycle if you will, but we're not necessarily short cycle. We've got a piece of the business and you hit some of the key ones that radios, night vision goggles, maybe a couple of other spots that are \u2013 that have backlog less than one times revenue. So for those businesses in particular, most of them are on programs of records today. They're well-supported. They're in the early innings of modernization and we feel very good about that. I'll take tactical radio for a minute on the DoD side. As we know, there's 350,000 to 400,000 radios that will be upgraded. There's about 10% of the way through there. You can see in the budget in 2021 continued to be well-supported in terms of revenue, in terms of budget authority for radio monetizations, and we're in the front end of a long modernization curve on tactical radios. The same thing is on the international side. There's more than a dozen countries on our front end of modernization. A lot of it announced a couple of 100,000 radios, $4 billion worth of pipeline. So, again, we're on the front end of modernization ramp on the international side, which is it tends to follow what happens in the U.S. And then you mentioned night vision goggles. We are on a sole source director requirement for ENVG-B. We delivered about 5,000 goggles to-date. We're on a program of record, which was announced in September, which we're one of the awardees for that, 100,000 plus night vision goggles. So we're 5% of the way through, again, with very clear budget visibility. So when you look at where we're at our modernization and visibility into the budgets, we think the outlook is very, very positive for all of those \u201cshorter cycle businesses\u201d, Gautam. Hey, good morning, Noah. Hey, good morning. So, I'll start that and maybe Chris can jump in on that. Look, Richard, the Maritime business has been a real strong performer for us in 2020. We have a good leadership. There was lots of pieces that were well integrated together. We're not completely through all that, but we're making really good progress. 2020 was a very strong year, was up double digits. The orders were really strong. Book-to-bill came in above 1, factored reasonably above 1, and we see continued growth in calendar 2021. We're calling it mid single-digit range, but lots of good indicators of continued growth there. We just have a very solid position. We do a lot of work on power conversion, power distribution, towed arrays, mass, sonars, crypto, a bunch of different things. And we've got a great position on the unmanned side as well. So it's pretty broad base. It's across both the OEM and service U.S. international, so \u2013 in manned and unmanned. So we liked the position that we happen to have. On the manned side, we've got good content on both Columbia and Virginia. Those programs are well-supported and Chris talked about the future frigate with Fincantieri. We've got a very strong position in content on the future frigate. Those all look really good and well-supported. And on the unmanned side, I think we're on the front end of this. It's not a big part of the business today, but it's growing. We're the only prime of any unmanned maritime vessel here for the U.S. Navy is the MUSV or the Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicle. We're the prime on that. That's a pretty good contract we're executing on. We've got a study on the LUSV, which is the Large Unmanned Surface Vessel. We're doing mine counter-measure systems. I think we talked about in a press release about a Phase 2 with \u2013 in Europe, with a partner where we're providing substantial content for unmanned manned \u2013 unmanned mind counter countermeasures systems and then all the underwater side. Really can't talk about the \u2013 on the classified business, but we've got a very strong position on undersea classified capabilities as well. So overall a very good business, with the hope and the direction we'd likely see in the budget of more growth focused on the Navy given where the future threats happened to be. I don't know, Chris, if I missed anything in that. Good morning, David. So, David, thank you. No, it's exactly the plan that we're working towards. It's the end of Q2. It's got a date and a time because it's written in a merger agreement and you're working towards that. I think more broadly, let nudges what's in the agreement is, is the partnership that I have with Chris and we're working with Jay, we've got a great leadership team. We're working well together. We're executing well on our strategy. We're aligned on the direction we're taking in the company. And you'll hear and see more of that in the investor briefing we're going to have in March, where Chris will talk a little bit about thoughts on becoming moving more towards emission solutions provider. As you see here, Ed and Sean talking about their businesses as well, but tracking well, performing well, and we're not expecting any sort of strategic redirection ready bump in the performance of the company. So thanks for the question. No, it's different than E3. E3 is additive to the synergy targets. So now, we had a really good year. The team is performing, very, very well. I talked a little bit about some of the drivers of the outperformance this year and why we took up our number to next year at $320 million to $350 million, which again is well above what we thought we would do in three years. And we are now doing more than that in two. So we're seeing a lot more opportunities in supply chain, we're still working through our facility rationalization, very, very good progress, substantial activities happening over the course of 2021. It has been very, very well and closely managed and monitored. It's going to execute very well. And we're seeing good opportunities are coming through there. Functional efficiencies, shared services, we just keep seeing more and more opportunities to get better. That's the spirit of continuous improvement. That's really, what's behind E3. That's why we think as we wrap up integration at the back end of 2021. And then in 2022, we really talk about it less as integration more as just productivity and operational excellence. We're going to have a good year in 2021, those are the things that drive it, so team is just executing very, very well. Good morning. So, Jon I think that's a good question. I think you laid out, kind of the response and the question, if you will. So you laid out some of the drivers next year. Yes, we do see \u2013 as I made that in my remarks, DoD in U.S. government low-single digits, we see revenue synergies about a point, we see international mid-single digit plus, some headwinds coming from commercial, but you're exactly right. As you start to get out into 2022 from 2021, we'll see less of it, maybe no commercial headwinds and maybe eventually starts to turn into a tailwind. We see international as a front-end of a build. Again, we're very under penetrated. We have 20% of our revenues in international and Chris laid out a growth target there. We performed very well in the back half of last year. It was up low-to-mid single digits. We had a very good Q3. And we've got some good momentum coming into this year, a very big pipeline, of our $67 billion total company pipeline $16 billion of which is an international. So we've got a lot of opportunities, we're chasing on the international front. And again, we've talked about the revenue synergies, about a point call it $150 million to $200 million net incremental in 2021 from 2020 we're still at the front end of the build. So we have 40 proposals that have been awarded. We won two-thirds of them, but there's 70 that are submitted so another 30 to be awarded or not. There's more that are happening in the future. So we hope to continue to build on that. And we do hope, just given the positioning of ourselves within the DoD budget, then low single digit growth from DoD could actually grow over time, because we're in great places that we are going to continue to get funded, but we're also growing as a mission solutions provider going after a larger addressable market. So, put all those pieces together, that should \u2013 that could drive acceleration beyond 2021. But right now we're laying out the 2021 framework and we are already thinking about mid-single digits beyond that. Good morning, Seth. So Seth that's a good question, in fact I remember the discussion from a few years ago about getting to $1 billion. And frankly, it happened a little bit sooner than we had even anticipated at that point in time. So we were just a tad under that last year. With our guidance, we'll be at or above \u2013 it will be above $1 billion this year. We're just very well-positioned across the tactical radio business, as you know. We're across all the services, across all the contract vehicles, very strong position and the Marine Corps was a big driver of us in 2020. We're sole-sourced on HF radios. We're sole-sourced there on Manpack. We'll compete on the handheld this year. We're sole-sourced across SOCOM. Army, we compete versus Thales and Collins. But the fact is I think given the momentum that we have here, we see continued share gains within those areas as well within the army. So, I think we're well positioned. The budgets are very supportive. When you look at all tactical radio in total in 2021 over 2020, the budgets themselves are up about 25%. HMS is up 16%, 17%. So there's very good continued budget coverage here. We're starting the year with mid-single-digit growth in DoD. We're coming off a very strong 2020 and an even stronger 2019. So maybe, hopefully, there's some conservatism built into that. But there's some competition happening this year, and we'll keep evaluating and updating investors through the year on just our progress in DoD. But frankly, the team has done a great job in positioning ourselves for success in tactical over a multiyear period. Good morning. So I'll start there. Maybe Jay and Chris can jump in. Look, I think there's going to be continued focus on the space domain, which we have spent a number of years repositioning the company to go after. Last year, it was a softer year. It was a transition year. We had a couple of program transitions. But you see in Q4, we came back very, very strongly. We're up high-single digits. We'll be up high single digits in 2021. We've got good wins. I mean, Chris walked through some of the key ones there. And frankly, that's just going to be continuing to be a growth area. And you heard some of the commentary, from Secretary Austin's commentary at his hearing about the focus on space and it's not just across DoD, there's a lot of classified community investments going on in the space. So I think, number one, we've got a really good position there going from components to systems, and I think a proven strategy. I think some of the things that's happening on the unmanned side are opportunities for the future, both on maritime as well as on the airborne side. We've got really strong positions in both sides. I think that's going to continue to be well-funded. At the end of the day, any fight in the future particularly against these near-peer competitors will require network platforms and not just simply platform improvements themselves, so how they work together. That requires resilient communications. Strong, secure, non-jammable resilient communications, and that is the sweet spot of the company. We keep talking about that. It's very, very important. And there's really no one that's better positioned to enable that JADC2 mission environment than where we happen to be. That's why we're on all of the ABMS contract vehicles, I think we've just had a great position there. That's going to continue to be well supported. So those are the areas that I think are going to be where we're best positioned. And I know what everyone else is talking about. We're sitting here with almost 4% of our revenue in IRAD. We're focusing our company. We've got a very unique situation with this merger where we can start off with a clean sheet and get all of our segments built from the day one to collaborate together, and that's why we're seeing traction here on the revenue synergies. So you put all those pieces together, and that's why I do believe that we've got just a strong powerful portfolio of businesses with good leadership that should outgrow our competitors into the future. Yes. So, Michael, just very quickly, on Land it's about 20% of our revenue, and it's well supported programs. A lot of its ISR aircraft that we feel very confident it's going to continue. On the service mix, yes, there is going to be kind of a tilt toward sea, air, space center-type platforms in a near-peer competition that's hearing a lot coming out of the navy, and I talked a lot about what's happening with the air force and the space force. So in a flat to declining budget environment, I think there's general speculation, army will be a bill payer here for us. The army is only about 10% of our revenue. It's smaller part of what we do even with the DoD. It's, I think, between the navy and the air force, it's about four times what the army happens to be. So it's not a big part of the company. I think, we are more predisposed to the air force was our biggest customer. And the navy, we spent a lot of time talking about some of the maritime opportunities here. So we think the shift is actually favorable to us. We think we're well-positioned there. And we think we can manage through those shifts happening right now between the services. So we like where we are. We like the positioning of our portfolio. And then, by the way, in 2021, we do think we can build the backlog because we'll see book-to-bill more than one. So, we think that will continue to grow into next year. So look, that wraps us up here today. Thank you very much. We had a strong solid year. It was a tough backdrop. And I want to thank again our employees for executing well on our strategic priorities, delivering value to our customers and our shareholders, but also providing a solid foundation to build on in 2021 as well as the medium-term. Again, thank you for joining the call this morning. And we look forward to speaking with you more, at our upcoming investor briefing on March 10. Thank you very much, everybody. Have a good day."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2020 earnings call. On the call with me today are Bill Brown, our CEO; Chris Kubasik, our COO; and Jay Malave, our CFO. First, a few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumption, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our press release, presentation and our SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website which is l3harris.com where a replay of this call will also be available. And to aid with year-over-year comparability, following the L3Harris merger, the first half of prior-year results will be on a pro forma basis. With that, Bill, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.\nBill Brown: Thank you, Rajeev and good morning, everyone. So two years ago this month, we announced the merger of L3 and Harris. And thanks to the hard work and perseverance of our employees, we've been able to deliver results consistent with or better than expectations, despite market volatility and unforeseen obstacles like COVID. Their efforts have led to another strong quarter and put us in a position to raise our 2020 guidance. The mitigation plans we implemented earlier in the year to manage COVID-19 have proven effective in keeping our employees safe and our facilities open and will remain in place for the foreseeable future. We also continue to support our supply chain through accelerated payments, totaling over $200 million in the quarter and nearly $0.5 billion year-to-date and we expect these advances will continue in the fourth quarter. Earlier today, we reported third quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.84, up a solid 10%. Company margins expanded 60 basis points to 17.9% on organic revenue growth of 4.5% and adjusted free cash flow was $726 million. Our core U.S. and international government businesses were up over 7% including double-digit growth internationally, partially offset by COVID-related impacts on our commercial businesses that were down largely in line with expectations. With another quarter of strong execution on our under our belt, we're improving our outlook for the year and increasing margins, earnings per share and free cash flow to the upper end of the prior range, while narrowing organic revenue growth to the prior midpoint of approximately 4%. It's worth noting that despite the pandemic headwinds, we're back to the midpoint of our initial 2020 earnings per share guide, a testament to the benefits of the merger and our earnings power. Integration activity continued to progress well. And then in the quarter we delivered net cost synergies of $50 million, bringing year-to-date savings to $165 million and well on track to meet our $185 million target this year. At this rate, we'll exit the year with $250 million in net cumulative savings, which positions us to deliver at least $300 million net in 2021, a year ahead of schedule. Our E3 operational excellence program continues to mature and become institutionalized and alongside cost synergies was a key driver of the 60 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter and 130 basis points year-to-date. With our strong performance to date, we're increasing our margin guidance to approximately 17.75% for the year, a 100 basis point improvement from 2019 and a solid base to build on over the medium term. As we look beyond 2020, we see three primary building blocks supporting mid-single-digit top line growth. First, we have a portfolio that is well aligned with national security priorities irrespective of the outcome of the elections. Our broad C5ISR capabilities are essential elements encountering the near-peer threats identified in the National Defense Strategy: resilient communications, open architecture command and control, offensive and defensive cyber and ISR across all spectrums electro optical, infrared, hyperspectral, RF, sonar; and all forms of intelligence, signals, comms, electronic and image. We have leadership positions in many of these areas and operate in all domains. And we've realigned our R&D efforts to extend our position through investments in open architecture, multifunction, software-defined technologies. The security threats are real and we anticipate that future defense budgets will continue to prioritize spending in these areas where we're well positioned and we're investing. Second, we uniquely benefit from the revenue synergy opportunities created in a merger of two complementary companies that expanded our addressable market. This quarter we received an additional 12 revenue synergy awards bringing the total down selected proposals to 25 out of 37 for a cumulative value of over $300 million, an initial down payment on our multi-billion dollar pipeline. Two recent wins worth highlighting are the Space Development Agency's tracking layer, which leveraged legacy Harris' strength in space payloads and integration with L3's onboard space avionics solutions. The other is SAFE-SiM, a DARPA program to simulate and train for future multi-domain battle that addresses the challenge of secured data sharing of highly classified sensors. And third, we see upside in international which at about 20% of revenue is underrepresented versus peers. With a now larger international footprint, we can better leverage our scale and extensive sales channels and capitalize on our domestic position to support global modernization efforts and extend our ISR leadership in the airborne, land and maritime domains. And as seen with recent awards this quarter to deliver missionized aircraft to both Canada and the Royal Australian Air Force, we're making progress. Our top-line and margin opportunities along with our discipline around working capital and CapEx support our free cash flow potential as well as our ability to return capital to shareholders. We're off to a good start to-date and now expect to deliver free cash flow of approximately $2.65 billion to $2.7 billion for the year at the top end of our prior guidance. This performance coupled with divestiture proceeds has enabled us to return over $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders in the third quarter, which put share repurchases to-date at $1.85 billion ahead of our full year 2020 commitment of $1.7 billion. For the full year, we now expect share repurchases to be about $2.2 billion, a pace we plan to sustain through next year. On portfolio reshaping, we're about one-third of the way through our bottoms-up target of divesting 8% to 10% of revenues and activity continues to be robust. Our criteria and strategy haven't changed as a result of recent events. We continue to be patient and persistent as we look to maximize value. And as previously stated, we will announce divestitures as they occur with proceeds primarily used for capital returns. So overall, we're executing well despite the uncertain times. And with our unique revenue, margin and cash opportunities we remain focused on delivering double-digit earnings and free cash flow per share. So with that, I'll turn it over to Chris to discuss segment results. Chris?\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Thank you, Bill and good morning, everyone. Let's go to slide 5. Integrated Mission Systems revenue increased 6.2% primarily from growth in our Maritime business as recently awarded manned and classified programs began to ramp up along with growth from our ISR business driven by strength in aircraft missionization. The modest decline in our Electro Optical business was due to timing of deliveries. Operating income was up 21% and margins expanded 190 basis points to 15.5% from operational excellence and integration benefits, partially offset by higher R&D investments. Order momentum at IMS was broad-based with particular strength in Maritime resulting in a segment funded book-to-bill of 1.08 for the quarter and 1.22 year-to-date. Our Maritime business continued to build out its pipeline of opportunities following the Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicle award. Additionally, the team finalized its position on the largest -- as the largest subcontractor on the U.S. Navy's frigate program. We're playing a key role as a mission solutions provider for electrical propulsion and navigation systems. The current 10-ship contract could exceed $300 million if all options are exercised. In addition, the Department of Defense recently reported its long-range plan to significantly expand the U.S. Navy's manned and unmanned ship count to over 500 with the greatest increase planned for unmanned vessels. With our experience and capabilities in both platform types, we are well-positioned to support the Navy's growth. Turning to Space and Airborne Systems. Organic revenue increased 6.8%. Growth in our Avionics business was driven by the production and modernization ramp on the F-35 and increased classified work at Intel and Cyber. These were somewhat offset by program timing in the Space and Electronic Warfare businesses, which based on recent awards including the F-18 IDECM contract position us for growth in the coming quarters. Segment operating income was flat and margins contracted 110 basis points to 18.5% as integration benefits and operational excellence were more than offset by program mix from recent wins. Overall funded book-to-bill was 1.04 for the quarter and 1.05 year-to-date with key awards received in our Space, Avionics and Electronic Warfare businesses. As Bill highlighted, our Space business was one of two awardees for a contract with the Space Development Agency to develop and integrate an end-to-end system of four satellites where we are providing both the bus and mission payload validating our space strategy to become a mission solutions prime. This system will provide warning and tracking of advanced threats including hypersonic missiles. The initial satellites will be launched within the next 24 months and support the tracking layer of the DoD's missile defense network in space. Once fully operational, there could be a demand for many more satellites with the value well into the billions leading to the next space-based franchise for our company. We expect to build on these opportunities in the near to medium-term with a space pipeline of over $10 billion in opportunities. Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was up 6.7% for the quarter driven by tactical growth in the mid-teens, which included international growth of about 20%. The Middle East, Europe and Asia Pacific provided most of that growth. Both DoD tactical and integrated vision systems benefited from continued modernization demand. This strength was partially offset by our public safety business due to COVID-19, which was down consistent with expectations in the mid-teens. Segment operating income was up 17% and margins expanded 230 basis points to 25% from operational excellence integration benefits and cost management. Funded book-to-bill was about 1.0 for the quarter and 0.94 year-to-date and was particularly strong in tactical communications at over 1.1 for the quarter. This was driven by an initial full-rate production award on the U.S. SOCOM's multichannel manpack program as part of the $255 million sole-sourced IDIQ, an important milestone for this multiyear modernization strategy. We also saw healthy activity on the international front including customers in the Middle East where we continue to build out our installed base and identify new opportunities. Lastly, Aviation Systems organic revenue decreased 4.1% as the anticipated COVID-19-related impacts in commercial aviation were partially offset by consistent strong performance in Defense Aviation Products, which was up high teens; and Mission Networks, which was up mid-single digits. Operating income was down 19% with most of the decline resulting from divestitures while margins contracted 40 basis points to 13% as integration benefits operational efficiencies and cost management were more than offset by COVID-19 related market headwinds in commercial aviation. Third quarter funded book-to-bill was 0.94, following strong first half orders resulting in a year-to-date funded book-to-bill of 1.08. Award activity was notable on several ground vehicle programs from the DoD and international customers for our power and propulsion systems, which totaled approximately $150 million. In addition, we recently announced that we're a partner with Northrop on the U.S. Air Force's GBSD program for operations and maintenance training systems, highlighting continued progress with next-generation programs and platforms. Now over to Jay, who will discuss the financials in more detail as well as our guidance. \nJay Malave: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a quick recap of third quarter results and then shift over to our updated outlook. In the quarter, organic revenue was up 4.4% and margins expanded 60 basis points to 17.9% as the benefit from synergies more than offset higher R&D investment. Earnings per share grew 10% or $0.26 as shown on slide 9. Of this growth synergies and operations contributed $0.24 along with a lower share count for $0.13, which more than offset headwinds from divestitures and pandemic impacted end markets. Free cash flow for the quarter was $726 million and we ended the quarter with 55 working capital days, holding the strong first half improvement of seven days. With year-to-date organic revenue growth just over 4% and margins of 17.9% along with a 5% higher backlog, L3Harris is set up well to close the year. So let's turn to slide 10 to cover our updated outlook. Organic revenue is now anticipated to be approximately up 4% or at the midpoint of our prior range with the top line trending largely as expected. Our core U.S. government businesses continue to perform well, up about 7% year-to-date and driven by DoD tactical radios, maritime, mission avionics and classified growth at intel and cyber, and defense aviation products. On the international side, the business returned to growth in the third quarter up double digits, which sets up for a flattish year or better supported by ISR and international tactical radios. And finally this guidance reflects about a two-point impact from our commercial businesses due to the pandemic in the range of our initial assessment. Shifting to margins, we've revised our outlook to approximately 17.75%, a 25 basis point increase versus our prior expectation from better cost performance and mitigation of COVID impacts. On EPS we are raising our full year to approximately $11.55 at the top end of our previous range and consistent with the midpoint set at the beginning of the year. As shown on slide 11, the increase of $0.20 from the prior midpoint is primarily driven by $0.13 of improvement in operations including our mitigation efforts plus $0.07 between a lower share count and other items. Moving to free cash flow, we now plan to deliver approximately $2.65 billion to $2.7 billion or the upper end of our prior guidance driven by higher net income and CapEx discipline. This keeps us on track to deliver our 2022 free cash flow target of $3 billion and double-digit annual growth on a per-share basis. On capital returns, we returned over $1.3 billion to shareholders in the third quarter with $1.15 billion of share repurchases and 175 -- $179 million in dividends. Year-to-date, total buybacks were $1.85 billion ahead of our prior target of $1.7 billion for the year. With an elevated cash position and solid cash generation anticipated in the fourth quarter, we now expect share buybacks for the year to be around $2.2 billion. And we expect to continue our shareholder-friendly capital framework into 2021, as we normalize our cash balance generate healthy cash flow and continue shaping our portfolio. Now switching to our segment outlook. In Integrated Mission Systems, we now anticipate revenues up approximately 6% for the year from the prior range of up 5.5% to 7%, driven by growth in ISR and Maritime. Segment margin is now expected to be about 15%, up 150 basis points versus the prior guidance driven by solid program performance and cost management. At Space and Airborne Systems, we're now guiding to organic revenue growth of approximately 7% within the previous range of up 6% to 7.5%, as higher F-35 revenues continue to drive Mission Avionics. Segment margin guidance remains unchanged at approximately 18.75%. In Communication Systems, organic revenue growth is expected to be approximately 4% and within the prior range of up 3.5% to 5%, mainly driven by modernization strength in DoD tactical radios. Segment margins are now expected to be about 24% a 25 basis point increase from our prior guidance, primarily from mix related to our Tactical business and cost management. And lastly, in Aviation Systems, we now anticipate revenues to be down approximately 3% on an organic basis versus our prior range of down 1% to 5% consistent with our prior estimates in the commercial aero business, partially offset by double-digit growth on the defense side from classified and other programs. Segment margin guidance remains unchanged at 13.25% reflecting the timely and decisive actions to mitigate commercial aero headwinds. So overall, we delivered solid performance in the quarter and year-to-date and now expect to deliver results consistent with our original EPS and free cash flow guidance set back in February. Before wrapping up, I'd like to briefly touch on our outlook post 2020. We'll provide 2021 guidance as we typically do with fourth quarter results. Though note we remain confident in our framework of annual double-digit growth in earnings and free cash flow per share, as the building blocks remain the same: mid single-digit top line growth, steady to rising margins, working capital and CapEx discipline and returning our free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. With that I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Mike [ph] Walton with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning everybody. You increased the repurchase effort by $0.5 billion directionally closer to sort of your pre-COVID capital return level of $3.5 billion, but not quite there yet. I'm just curious, is there anything that would hold you back from going that much higher? And then more philosophically, Bill or Chris, as you look at capital returns through dividends and repurchase, do you have more headroom here to maybe push the dividends a little bit harder? And do you think that would be more appealing to investors? Thanks.\nBill Brown: So Myles, I'll start on the second one and maybe I'll ask Jay to come back on the first one on the buyback. Look on capital returns, we -- the philosophy really is 100% of our free cash flow coming back to owners in repurchases or dividends and we see that through next year. We've been leaning pretty heavily into share buybacks and Jay will talk in a minute about our philosophy there. Based on our share price, we think that that's a good value. We do see our dividend with some room to move up. We've been up about 25% in our dividend rate since close. We had raised it twice once at close and once at the beginning of this year. But at about 28% of our free cash flow being paid out, it's below the bottom end of our range. And we'll expect to take a hard look at that early next year and probably lean a little bit heavier into our dividend. But broadly, all of our cash will come back to owners plus divestiture proceeds through at least next year. Jay, you want to talk about the buyback?\nJay Malave: Sure. Myles in the third quarter, we increased a little bit relative to the proceeds about $150 million. If you just do the math, I would say $350 million here in Q4. You can back into our free cash flow for the fourth quarter. And with the dividends we're approaching kind of the framework that Bill just mentioned as far as returning free cash flow to shareholders. Yes, there could be a little bit more room there. I mean our balance is elevated with $1.3 billion at the end of September. Given where we are with the guidance we just gave you, we would expect the balance to continue to remain elevated in December. And so there could be opportunity there. We're also evaluating other items which could include some pension contributions but -- so we're leaving our optionality open a little bit. But if it doesn't happen in this quarter then it would carry over into next year. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Ms. Kahyaoglu, I'm showing its muted, you're live for question.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi, sorry about that. Thank you guys for the question and good morning. I wanted to ask about just integration activity. Clearly, it's been performing really well and EBIT was up $32 million in the quarter. But ex-synergies, your incrementals were about flat. And then the implied incremental for 2021, ex-synergies is 20%. So, how are you thinking about maybe incrementals going forward outside of synergies? And what changes with mix going forward? Thank you.\nJay Malave: So, Sheila it's a great question. If you think about it maybe in kind of a little bit bigger picture, we end the year this year we'll be at 17.75% for the year around that ballpark. We do have incremental synergies next year $50 million. That equates to anywhere around 25, 30 basis points of expansion. Our core E3 productivity is obviously going to be a driver for us, but we do have some mixed headwinds that we'll be dealing with and we deal with that every year. And so our intent always is to drive more than the mix headwinds. But I think for now right now as we're continuing to go through the planning offsetting one for one is where we stand at the moment. The only thing I'll say is that we will see a little bit of a headwind in Q1 because of the -- just the roll-through of the commercial the pandemic-related impacts roll through the four quarters. And so that will put a little bit of pressure on Q1 which will also have an impact obviously on the full year. But having said that I think mix is something we just have to keep an eye on, but our core E3 productivity is intended to offset that on a kind of run rate basis and drive. Once we get beyond the synergy period in the integration period, our core E3 operating excellence program will continue to be a driver of margins for us.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKristine Liwag: Hey good morning everyone. Bill and Chris what drove your narrower 2020 revenue outlook? And I know it's still too early to talk 2021, but how much of your expected 2021 revenue is already in the backlog versus what you need to go out and win? \nBill Brown: So, right now as you'll see in the Q, our funded and unfunded backlog at the end of Q3 was about $20 billion. And you'll note there about two-thirds of it 65% rolls out through calendar 2021. So, we think that that part of our business is pretty solid. We've got a very good pipeline $69 billion. It's come up over the last quarter. It's come up about 8% or 10% since the beginning of the year. So, it continues to grow be very robust. And as we look into next year and to Jay's points about mid-single-digit growth we see good solid growth in our core U.S. government businesses. You've heard a couple of our peers talk about low to mid-single-digit growth there. We will add on top of that with revenue synergies that we've talked quite a bit about. We see international growing. It's a growth business for us here in the back half. Book-to-bill was very good. The pipeline is really strong internationally. We see that being a contributor into next year. And certainly as Jay just mentioned about commercial, it will be a little bit of a headwind until we lap one year on COVID. But the other dimensions will be pretty strong going to next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning. Maybe two areas following up there to talk about growth. One is in space. I know Chris you mentioned a lot of the opportunities there. Is there a point in which we should see the -- maybe the book-to-bill step up even further and the backlog start to grow a little bit more? And then Bill you just mentioned the international opportunities. Are those principally on the tactical radio side, or are they across IMS or avionics or other areas? Thanks.\nChris Kubasik: Hey good morning Seth. I'll take a first shot at both of those. Yes, so in space, we're going to be seeing the book-to-bill increase. We talked about some of the key wins we had here in the third quarter. We talked about our strategy to be a mission solutions prime and it's really taken traction here. The SDA win was a big one. There are some opportunities coming down the pipe in the fourth quarter. A fair amount of them are in the classified world but you'll be able to see that in the quarters ahead. As Bill said on the international side, we do have a strong pipeline a good book-to-bill. The tactical radios are going to grow. That represents about 20% to 25% of our international revenue. We're really seeing it across the board. The ISR platforms are doing well with the aircraft missionization and of course the Maritime business. So it's pretty well spread out across the portfolio and the domains.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nGautam Khanna: Good morning. Thanks and congrats on the SDA win. Guys I was hoping you could elaborate on the revenue synergy opportunity. The SDA win seems like that was -- that kind of establishes a new franchise for you guys. Are there other kind of new franchise-setting opportunities within that pipeline that you could maybe elaborate on, so we could think about growth beyond 2021 as well? And would you be willing to opine on where you think the topline will shake out in terms of growth rate in '22?\nBill Brown: Well, first on '22 it's a little bit further out in the future, but I might -- maybe answer the first part of the question as Chris thinks about if he wants to give any guidance on '22. But we're making really good progress on the revenue synergies. And I think this has been a pleasant surprise to all of us in terms of the pace and magnitude of getting that revenue opportunity. I think, it points to the strategic rationale of the combination and the complementary nature of the technology that we're working on. So again, we're about 80 proposals that have been submitted. It's come up from Q3. We're winning quite a few of them. 25 out of 37 is pretty healthy with $300 million of awards. We talked about a couple of these are some of the -- certainly the SDA win is one of the bigger ones. But generally speaking, they're going to be in the space domain electronic warfare, some in maritime. And there's quite a lot that's happening in the classified domain. As we said over multiple calls, one of the things that was unique here is, as we put our companies together, we got a lot of input and feedback from our classified customers, who really see across our portfolio and across other missions across other companies and really giving us strong guidance as to where there might be opportunities to combine capabilities within L3Harris. And the team has worked very hard to put together some compelling proposals and we continue to win. So, it's modest growth this year. It will start to grow next year and be a good contributor in 2021 and certainly more beyond that. It will grow to hundreds of millions over the next year or two which I think is a very positive sign for not just winning them, but actually seeing them come through in revenue opportunity. So, I'm really, really pleased here Gautam on sort of the revenue synergy. I don't know Chris maybe answer the question on '22 if you want to take a stab at that one.\nChris Kubasik: Absolutely. No, I agree with Bill we're really outperforming here on the revenue synergy. And over time and probably by 2022, the business development pursuits and as the business integrates, these things are really going to be merging and part of our overall strategy. So, I'm thinking by the time we get to '22, '23, I'm not sure we're going to be calling these out. What it is going to do is give us higher confidence in our growth rate that we've already talked about. So, I'm looking for good opportunities and year-over-year growth improvement relative to revenue synergies. But over time, it's just going to be merged and part of our normal processes.\nBill Brown: And I think Jay's comment about the mid-single-digit framework kind of expand -- spans a bit more than one year. Thank you, Gautam.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning. Bill, I get this question a lot from investors so I thought I'd give it to you. There's this perception that your portfolio is shorter cycle than your peer group. I guess how much of your portfolio do you view as short cycle converting from backlog into sales I guess within 12 to 18 months? And do you view your portfolio as shorter cycle and I guess more at risk than your peer group to lower budgets? Thanks.\nBill Brown: So David thanks for the question. Look, as I mentioned earlier about two-thirds of our backlog coming out of Q3 what you'll see in the Q is around 20 -- a little over $20 billion funded and unfunded rolls out over the next year. And what I've seen over time is it's hard to compare our portfolio sort of short long cycle versus peers. But certainly, it has lengthened over the last several years as some of the programs that we worked on specifically in tactical radios have moved from sort of book and ship, a quick turn to replenish spares or radios in Iraq and Afghanistan to now being fundamental long-term programs of record which a lot more -- longer visibility in terms of the buying pattern the spending outlook. So, we certainly see our portfolio being longer term than we were several years ago. And certainly, combining with L3, I think puts us in that position as well. So again, I think our portfolio is very sound. It's robust. We're well positioned to grow into next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question.\nPete Skibitski: Hey good morning guys. Bill, can you maybe talk at a high level about these new concepts as ABMS and JADC2? I think you have some bids in there and they seem pretty well supported in DoD. I just wondered, if you can maybe size the opportunity set for you there. It's still a little nebulous. And maybe talk about timing just maybe level set us on your expectations?\nBill Brown: So Pete, it's a very good question. Look, you know what -- and I took some pains in my comments to talk about the broad set of C5ISR capability we've had across the company. And when you break down C5 and ISR into its components and domains different sensing technologies, we've got a very strong position across all of them, all of which are essential in enabling this JADC2 or Joint All-Domain Command and Control vision of the future. We're a strong player there. I think on ABMS we've -- lots of players on the IDIQ, but we are across all seven business areas which is somewhat unique. We had content on Project Convergence which is sort of the Army version of that in partnership with the Air Force. We had a lot of content there and we'll hope to see more as it gets into the next version of it next year. We're very strong in maritime and distributed maritime operations. So we believe this is a strength of ours. We've got very strong capabilities in comms resilient communications which is developing very strong resilient wave forms. L3 was -- had a strength there. We had certainly a strength there, very strong ISR. So to me we're right in the middle of this. And I think it's fundamental that JADC2 or that vision that concept is going to be required in a near-peer competition. It's going to be more about the capabilities on platforms and how they inter-operate as opposed to the platforms themselves. And when I think about this powerhouse that we've created here at L3Harris, Pete I think we're right going to be in the middle of it. It will grow over time. There's funding there and we're confident that's going to be a driver for the company over time. It's hard to size it today, but we believe it's going to be pretty important Pete. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please proceed.\nRichard Safran: Good morning everybody. How are you doing?\nBill Brown: Good morning Richard.\nRichard Safran: Just a very quick question here on R&D, I wanted to ask you about your opening remarks on research and development. Given the number of wins and the fact that your win rate has been increasing in your remarks, I want to know how you're thinking about R&D longer term, if you think it could be ratcheted back a bit? Do you need to spend more R&D to support the increasing win rate on programs, or are you really just about the right level right now? \nBill Brown: Hey Richard thanks for the question. I think you're hitting on a very important topic and that is the power of the IRAD that we spend and the work that's happened over the last five quarters. We're spending in the 3.6% 3.8% of our revenue in that range. We think it's sized well. And I think more importantly what the team has done is worked very hard over the last five quarters to make sure, it's spent on the best highest-value highest-return opportunities and focusing that spear we call IRAD.  We've reduced the number of projects by about 30%. We moved about 10% of the dollars around to really be placed on the technology the areas that we think will have the best returns or aligned to revenue opportunities, revenue synergies. And the second element of it is making -- not just putting the -- making sure we're spending on the right projects, but also doing it efficiently. So we've got good opportunities to drive operational excellence skills into the way we develop products. We're pushing hard on digital engineering on DevOps and a lot of our work is software development. There's lots of ways to improve the effectiveness of our R&D spend. And to me this is going to be a very powerful driver of growth in the future. I don't see it stepping up materially from where we're at. I think it's at a good amount. It will come up with revenue in the terms of a dollar perspective, but I think we're spending a healthy amount on R&D. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Harned: Good morning. I want to go back really to the budget here. When you look across the portfolio, I'm trying to understand how your businesses are affected by end strength and forward-deployed end strength. And changes really aren't in the plans right now. It's in terms of at least basic number of let's say army troops. But we're about to have an election. So if we were to see military personnel reduced in the coming years how would that affect you? And I'd ask the same thing for changes in forward-deployed troops such as movement in troops out of Afghanistan Iraq or elsewhere. So when you look across the businesses how are you tied to those levels? \nBill Brown: So Doug I'll start here maybe going to ask Chris to jump in. I don't think we're going to be much affected by redeployment of overseas troops back onshore. I don't think that's going to be a big driver of growth either a top headwind or a tailwind. On end strength it would come back to things like businesses like night vision goggle or radios where those are distributed out to individual soldiers. But frankly we're on the front end of a modernization ramp, even through the next five years. We're not even 40% through the modernization ramp in -- with radio. So even if end strength comes down as I expect it likely will, I don't think it's going to affect the growth rate in our radio business. I think you are so far underpenetrated with new technology both night vision, as well as radios that we still see good growth opportunities there. So if anything reduced end strength might actually free up some dollars to be put onto modernization investments that really affect a broad part of our business. I don't know if Chris you wanted to add to that? \nChris Kubasik: Yes. And if there is a reduction in the forward-deployed troops, I mean you look at the rest of the portfolio Doug and situational awareness is going to be critical. So you look at the ISR assets that we have both in space and air and the need as Bill talked about for the multi-domain comms. It strengthens the rest of the portfolio. So I look at it as kind of a net-net push or maybe a slight positive when you look across all four segments. And the same theory applies internationally. There's just a lot of need for communications and situational awareness. So our ISR capabilities both in space, air, land and maritime are well positioned.\nDoug Harned: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nNoah Poponak: Hey, good morning everyone.\nBill Brown: Good morning, Noah.\nNoah Poponak: Hey, guys. So kind of every quarter since the merger we sort of all get on these earnings calls and question you on the sustainability of your growth rate and ask about short cycle and the O&M exposure. And I think those are sensible questions and you guys provide decent answers to those that have some conservatism, but are mostly qualitative in nature. And after every one of those conversations the stock just de-rates moving sideways, while you're performing well and the numbers are going up. And so, I guess, I wonder how much are you all talking about that internally in terms of a different way to start from scratch and reframe this for investors? I mean, you talk about the handful of franchises you have. The defense budget is broken down into a handful of franchises. Is there a way to sort of while still giving detail like super simplify this so that people can see on a legit three to five-year basis you really can keep growing mid single-digits? Because otherwise it just feels like we're just sort of circling back to the same things every quarter. I don't know. I mean maybe there's no good answer to that and you just have to keep performing and the stock eventually matches to the numbers. But I was pretty curious if you guys talk about that or think about that internally and if you could share any thoughts with us.\nBill Brown: Well, yes, go ahead.\nJay Malave: Well, no, I think, I'd comment some of the new awards that we talked about. Just I think it demonstrates and is illustrative of our positioning for the modernization trends that we're seeing going forward. And so while people may want to focus on O&M budgets and historical tactical radios, the new awards that we're winning are really positioning us well for the trends that we're seeing in terms of defense priority spending. And so I think you should as Bill mentioned think about our portfolio and our revenue potential more in that broader context. And that's what gives us confidence in our mid single-digit growth over and we're seeing this in our new awards right now.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nBill Brown: Hey, good morning, Rob.\nRobert Stallard: Bill you've mentioned defense exports a couple of times this morning. And I think earlier this year you were suggesting this area could be a bit slower, but that doesn't seem to have happened. So wondered if you could comment on what changed there. And also looking forward and maybe to follow on Noah's question how big could defense exports be as a percentage of sales going forward?\nBill Brown: So, yeah, as we talked earlier this year right after I think it was Q1 maybe Q2 as we looked at the international business we saw it being more flattish for the year. We saw the first half being down a little bit the back half growing and being about flat for the year. Q3 came in strong like we had expected it would a little bit better than we had thought. So it could be up a little bit, so flat to up low single-digits internationally, so a little better than we saw a couple of months ago. International tactical has come in almost exactly as we had expected. You could see the numbers up 21% in the third quarter. We expect the fourth quarter up a similar amount. So we see good recovery in that business. A lot of it is Middle East, Europe, Asia-Pacific mostly Australia and New Zealand. So, there's pretty good growth in tactical. And we've got a nice pipeline of opportunities. I think the number is about $20 billion of international opportunities. The book-to-bill year-to-date is over 1 about 1.06 or so. We see the fourth quarter looking -- shaping up to be pretty sizable in terms of book-to-bill looks pretty good. About $3 billion of those proposals that are out there of our pipeline is in proposal. So it's actually getting to be more nearer term. So it's looking a little bit more encouraging than we thought just a couple of months ago. I think Chris and the team are putting a lot of focus on this. We have resources in place going after 10 focused countries and we're starting to turn the corner. So we're at 20% roughly in terms of our revenue. We expect it's going to grow several points over the next number of years. I don't know Chris if you want to state a goal there but it's going to come up from where we are because it's underrepresented in our portfolio today.\nChris Kubasik : Yeah. I think ultimately the next target would be closer to the 25% of revenue over the several years. And what I like about our company is the portfolio and the demand for our products. And when you export there's always a focus on offensive versus defensive products especially as administrations look at approving these exports. And when you look at our ISR capabilities, the maritime capabilities the radio to comms, those are generally easier to export and approve regardless of which administration is running the country. So I think that gives us a lot of confidence. And we've been able to stay in touch with our customers. We have executives forward deployed full time in the focus countries. And all of us have been using new technology to call Zoom and stay in touch with our customers really on a weekly basis, and that's working well. We're negotiating contracts via Zoom and continuing to keep the business running. So, very optimistic on international. \nRobert Stallard: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Arment: Yeah. Good morning, Bill. Nice results. Bill, I guess on the working capital you've given us a lot of details. Just kind of a clarification is the seven-day improvement year-to-date the number? And is that a good kind of I guess pacing item as we think about your goal to get to the low 40s as we think about next year and into 2022 to hit that kind of $3 billion free cash flow target? Thanks.\nBill Brown: Yes. Thanks, Peter. Yeah, so seven days year-to-date it's about 13 days operationally since the close. So we put out our divestitures and purchase accounting. We will see towards the back end of the year. We'll probably stay right on 55 days. So, you won't see seven-days improvement over three quarters as the continued pace into the future. We see the 55 dropping below 50 over the next couple of years three to four days per year. That gets us to the $3 billion goal in calendar 2022. We still see an opportunity to get down to the low 40s or about 40 days. Certainly, that's where legacy Harris was. We've seen our peers at that point. So even after calendar 2022 47, 48 days we see opportunity to continue to prove working capital beyond that. As I said last time and we've talked about this a number of times a lot of it is going to be on inventory. So we've got a lot of opportunity here. We know where it's at. We've got 10 businesses that we're really focused on that drive 75% of our working capital six with more than 75 days. So we know where we're focused. We're driving it hard. We review these every single week. And you can see the progress and trajectory that we happen to be on. So, again, about three to four days a year beyond calendar 2020.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Raviv: Good morning. Thank you. I know you talked a lot about margin going above 18% with the synergy drop-through offsetting the mix. I think there's been some conversation over the last month or so about a long-term opportunity for 20% margin. What's your perspective on how you get there? Is it all in your control, or do you need some customer behavior to change? And then also, if we're going to get there is it linear, or could there something \u2013 could something big pop up in a given year such that you have to make a big investment margin could step back for a year or two and then kind of hitting that margin expansion growth trajectory again? So more of a long-term question there around margin? Thank you.\nBill Brown: Hey, John, look it's a good question. I mean I think we're really performing better than we had expected on margins even through this year. Keep in mind, we started the year I think guiding to 17% to 17.5%. And now, today it's 17.75%. So in an era of COVID, which actually dinged us about 40 basis points this year, so we're performing very, very well. It comes through the synergy drop-through. It comes through operational excellence, which is maturing at a fast clip. Jay has talked about 18% or so next year. He gave you some of the drivers. Will it go up beyond that? It will likely move up. I don't know if and when it will hit 20%. I think the key thing to be thinking about is we got to make sure that we're leaning in to go after and drive revenue growth capturing some opportunities, which might have a near-term short-term impact on margins, but long term be good businesses for the overall enterprise. We got to make sure we continue to invest at the level required to grow the business on a long-term basis. Anyone could easily pull back investment like IRAD, and drive margin up in the near term, but be detrimental on long-term value for the owners. I think you have to work the pedals here, and I think we do this very, very effectively. So we can't commit to something beyond next year, but we will commit to continue to work the agenda to drive hard on technology investments which drive differentiation and good cost management lean productivity across the whole company. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed with your question.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes. I wanted to know, what's the progress payment benefits you've gotten this year, and then how much benefit from payroll deferral. And is that inhibiting getting to the $3 billion of free cash flow next year? I'm assuming, CapEx probably is no higher next year than what you're saying this year? Thanks.\nJay Malave: Sure George. Thanks. The progress payment benefit this year is in the range of say around close to $100 million in that ballpark maybe a little bit lower than that. That one, we basically have offset with small supplier payments. And so it's just one for one as it's come in. We really pushed supplier payments out. On the payroll tax benefit, that's kind of $150 million plus in that ballpark, similar type of effort. We've kind of put a placeholder there to support supply chain there as well. That as you know, will be paid back over two years 2021 and 2022. But I would say, as it relates to kind of longer-term targets and our $3 billion target, there's a number of puts and takes. There's risks and opportunities. We've got that factored in. We feel good about our ability to generate continued working capital improvement and we don't see that getting in the way of us getting to $3 billion in 2022. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nRon Epstein: Hey, guys. Good morning.\nBill Brown: Good morning, Ron.\nRon Epstein: Bill, just following up on one of your earlier comments. You gave us some color on the growth in classified. Can you give us more detail on that? And you mentioned that that's a big area for synergies. I mean, -- and then I realize it's classified, right? So it's difficult. But can you give us some more feel around that? And then also how many more opportunities are there out there? Can you share the growth profile? And what percentage of the overall business is classified today?\nBill Brown: Okay. So let me hit on a couple of points there, Ron. But you're right a lot of it's classified in terms of its nature. But it's about 20% of our total company revenue is classified. And as you know, the classified budgets both military and national intelligence programs. Those budgets have come up over the last five or six years. They're at a very healthy level. And that does offer some cushion, if you will, as you go into the next several years. If there's more pressure on the non-classified DoD budget, money tends to move and be well supported in the classified domain. And even the elements of that of what's in the classified budget, which is around $85 billion plus or minus between military and national intelligence programs, the elements are actually moving in a direction, which we believe supports a lot of the investments we've made. So, a lot of we focus on is in the space domain, various new technologies for optics RF systems, driving to larger constellations from prototypes running a full end-to-end mission solution. I think what's an interesting element of this is, historically, a lot of the space domain was dominated by the intelligence community. But, because of the lower cost faster time to market, more onboard processing of our small satellites, it's opening up new markets within the DoD. So the addressable base for us is actually expanding, and that's helping us quite a bit. So it's really on the space domain, but there's plenty of other classified opportunities on the land in Maritime domains as well. We've got a strong position really across all of them. So it's hard to shape them, but it gets back to the comment I made on the strength of C5ISR. And a lot of the things that we do in the classified domain leverage off of that, we hone technologies advanced technologies, and then you can leverage that benefit into the non-class environment. And that's been a strategy of the company for a number of years Ron, and I think it's worked pretty well. \nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Spingarn: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in. So, Bill, just following up on that. It seems like the competitive landscape for some of your work is changing a bit. There are some public companies in government services that are increasingly moving into comms and EW. And then you have some private companies, especially out on the West Coast like Anduril and UAVs and SpaceX and smallsats. And the Air Force is also encouraging new contractor formation, business formation. So, ultimately would you accept the premise the competitive landscape is changing? How do you negotiate this in a potentially flattening budget? And how much will M&A factor in?\nBill Brown: Rob, it's a very, very good question. So the landscape is changing. We are seeing greater penetration of some of the Western companies Silicon Valley companies, SpaceX you mentioned. As you know, they were one of the awardees of the SDA tracking layer. We could follow what they've done in commercial launch and with Starlink and other things. So they're playing more. There's a number of other companies. You mentioned a few of them. There are some more typical government contractors who are looking to expand what they do into -- from services to other components. So, the market is moving around and we get it. The way we stay ahead is basically running our strategy, running our game which is really strong investments and performance in R&D and technology moving quickly. There's really nobody that's put up a smallsat with the capability we had and the time frame we've done it just in the last couple of years. And I think that's the way we stay ahead. We continue to drive cost out drive operational excellence, improve quality and meet our program objectives. And I think if we do that and we continue to accelerate the pace at which we can execute on our programs and technologies we're going to stay ahead. I think that's what we need to do. Will M&A play a role in that? Maybe over time. Right now, we're focused on integration our portfolio shaping. But as you go out in time, there could be pieces of other companies or things on the market that could become available to fill a gap in our portfolio. We don't see that today but that's very positive. In fact, it's probably likely it's going to happen over time. But today, we're focused on running our game, and I think that's been an effective strategy. So, Rob thanks for the question. It was very good. I really appreciate that.\nBill Brown: Let me just wrap up from here. And I want to thank again the L3Harris team. They've done a fantastic job of staying focused to meeting our customer commitments. They work very, very hard, and that hard work has led to another quarter of very strong results. We're well positioned coming into next -- into the year-end and into the coming years. And I look forward to our next update. Thank you very much everybody for joining us today. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Chris Kubasik",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Bill and good morning, everyone. Let's go to slide 5. Integrated Mission Systems revenue increased 6.2% primarily from growth in our Maritime business as recently awarded manned and classified programs began to ramp up along with growth from our ISR business driven by strength in aircraft missionization. The modest decline in our Electro Optical business was due to timing of deliveries. Operating income was up 21% and margins expanded 190 basis points to 15.5% from operational excellence and integration benefits, partially offset by higher R&D investments. Order momentum at IMS was broad-based with particular strength in Maritime resulting in a segment funded book-to-bill of 1.08 for the quarter and 1.22 year-to-date. Our Maritime business continued to build out its pipeline of opportunities following the Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicle award. Additionally, the team finalized its position on the largest -- as the largest subcontractor on the U.S. Navy's frigate program. We're playing a key role as a mission solutions provider for electrical propulsion and navigation systems. The current 10-ship contract could exceed $300 million if all options are exercised. In addition, the Department of Defense recently reported its long-range plan to significantly expand the U.S. Navy's manned and unmanned ship count to over 500 with the greatest increase planned for unmanned vessels. With our experience and capabilities in both platform types, we are well-positioned to support the Navy's growth. Turning to Space and Airborne Systems. Organic revenue increased 6.8%. Growth in our Avionics business was driven by the production and modernization ramp on the F-35 and increased classified work at Intel and Cyber. These were somewhat offset by program timing in the Space and Electronic Warfare businesses, which based on recent awards including the F-18 IDECM contract position us for growth in the coming quarters. Segment operating income was flat and margins contracted 110 basis points to 18.5% as integration benefits and operational excellence were more than offset by program mix from recent wins. Overall funded book-to-bill was 1.04 for the quarter and 1.05 year-to-date with key awards received in our Space, Avionics and Electronic Warfare businesses. As Bill highlighted, our Space business was one of two awardees for a contract with the Space Development Agency to develop and integrate an end-to-end system of four satellites where we are providing both the bus and mission payload validating our space strategy to become a mission solutions prime. This system will provide warning and tracking of advanced threats including hypersonic missiles. The initial satellites will be launched within the next 24 months and support the tracking layer of the DoD's missile defense network in space. Once fully operational, there could be a demand for many more satellites with the value well into the billions leading to the next space-based franchise for our company. We expect to build on these opportunities in the near to medium-term with a space pipeline of over $10 billion in opportunities. Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was up 6.7% for the quarter driven by tactical growth in the mid-teens, which included international growth of about 20%. The Middle East, Europe and Asia Pacific provided most of that growth. Both DoD tactical and integrated vision systems benefited from continued modernization demand. This strength was partially offset by our public safety business due to COVID-19, which was down consistent with expectations in the mid-teens. Segment operating income was up 17% and margins expanded 230 basis points to 25% from operational excellence integration benefits and cost management. Funded book-to-bill was about 1.0 for the quarter and 0.94 year-to-date and was particularly strong in tactical communications at over 1.1 for the quarter. This was driven by an initial full-rate production award on the U.S. SOCOM's multichannel manpack program as part of the $255 million sole-sourced IDIQ, an important milestone for this multiyear modernization strategy. We also saw healthy activity on the international front including customers in the Middle East where we continue to build out our installed base and identify new opportunities. Lastly, Aviation Systems organic revenue decreased 4.1% as the anticipated COVID-19-related impacts in commercial aviation were partially offset by consistent strong performance in Defense Aviation Products, which was up high teens; and Mission Networks, which was up mid-single digits. Operating income was down 19% with most of the decline resulting from divestitures while margins contracted 40 basis points to 13% as integration benefits operational efficiencies and cost management were more than offset by COVID-19 related market headwinds in commercial aviation. Third quarter funded book-to-bill was 0.94, following strong first half orders resulting in a year-to-date funded book-to-bill of 1.08. Award activity was notable on several ground vehicle programs from the DoD and international customers for our power and propulsion systems, which totaled approximately $150 million. In addition, we recently announced that we're a partner with Northrop on the U.S. Air Force's GBSD program for operations and maintenance training systems, highlighting continued progress with next-generation programs and platforms. Now over to Jay, who will discuss the financials in more detail as well as our guidance. Hey good morning Seth. I'll take a first shot at both of those. Yes, so in space, we're going to be seeing the book-to-bill increase. We talked about some of the key wins we had here in the third quarter. We talked about our strategy to be a mission solutions prime and it's really taken traction here. The SDA win was a big one. There are some opportunities coming down the pipe in the fourth quarter. A fair amount of them are in the classified world but you'll be able to see that in the quarters ahead. As Bill said on the international side, we do have a strong pipeline a good book-to-bill. The tactical radios are going to grow. That represents about 20% to 25% of our international revenue. We're really seeing it across the board. The ISR platforms are doing well with the aircraft missionization and of course the Maritime business. So it's pretty well spread out across the portfolio and the domains. Absolutely. No, I agree with Bill we're really outperforming here on the revenue synergy. And over time and probably by 2022, the business development pursuits and as the business integrates, these things are really going to be merging and part of our overall strategy. So, I'm thinking by the time we get to '22, '23, I'm not sure we're going to be calling these out. What it is going to do is give us higher confidence in our growth rate that we've already talked about. So, I'm looking for good opportunities and year-over-year growth improvement relative to revenue synergies. But over time, it's just going to be merged and part of our normal processes. Yes. And if there is a reduction in the forward-deployed troops, I mean you look at the rest of the portfolio Doug and situational awareness is going to be critical. So you look at the ISR assets that we have both in space and air and the need as Bill talked about for the multi-domain comms. It strengthens the rest of the portfolio. So I look at it as kind of a net-net push or maybe a slight positive when you look across all four segments. And the same theory applies internationally. There's just a lot of need for communications and situational awareness. So our ISR capabilities both in space, air, land and maritime are well positioned. Yeah. I think ultimately the next target would be closer to the 25% of revenue over the several years. And what I like about our company is the portfolio and the demand for our products. And when you export there's always a focus on offensive versus defensive products especially as administrations look at approving these exports. And when you look at our ISR capabilities, the maritime capabilities the radio to comms, those are generally easier to export and approve regardless of which administration is running the country. So I think that gives us a lot of confidence. And we've been able to stay in touch with our customers. We have executives forward deployed full time in the focus countries. And all of us have been using new technology to call Zoom and stay in touch with our customers really on a weekly basis, and that's working well. We're negotiating contracts via Zoom and continuing to keep the business running. So, very optimistic on international."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Jay Malave",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a quick recap of third quarter results and then shift over to our updated outlook. In the quarter, organic revenue was up 4.4% and margins expanded 60 basis points to 17.9% as the benefit from synergies more than offset higher R&D investment. Earnings per share grew 10% or $0.26 as shown on slide 9. Of this growth synergies and operations contributed $0.24 along with a lower share count for $0.13, which more than offset headwinds from divestitures and pandemic impacted end markets. Free cash flow for the quarter was $726 million and we ended the quarter with 55 working capital days, holding the strong first half improvement of seven days. With year-to-date organic revenue growth just over 4% and margins of 17.9% along with a 5% higher backlog, L3Harris is set up well to close the year. So let's turn to slide 10 to cover our updated outlook. Organic revenue is now anticipated to be approximately up 4% or at the midpoint of our prior range with the top line trending largely as expected. Our core U.S. government businesses continue to perform well, up about 7% year-to-date and driven by DoD tactical radios, maritime, mission avionics and classified growth at intel and cyber, and defense aviation products. On the international side, the business returned to growth in the third quarter up double digits, which sets up for a flattish year or better supported by ISR and international tactical radios. And finally this guidance reflects about a two-point impact from our commercial businesses due to the pandemic in the range of our initial assessment. Shifting to margins, we've revised our outlook to approximately 17.75%, a 25 basis point increase versus our prior expectation from better cost performance and mitigation of COVID impacts. On EPS we are raising our full year to approximately $11.55 at the top end of our previous range and consistent with the midpoint set at the beginning of the year. As shown on slide 11, the increase of $0.20 from the prior midpoint is primarily driven by $0.13 of improvement in operations including our mitigation efforts plus $0.07 between a lower share count and other items. Moving to free cash flow, we now plan to deliver approximately $2.65 billion to $2.7 billion or the upper end of our prior guidance driven by higher net income and CapEx discipline. This keeps us on track to deliver our 2022 free cash flow target of $3 billion and double-digit annual growth on a per-share basis. On capital returns, we returned over $1.3 billion to shareholders in the third quarter with $1.15 billion of share repurchases and 175 -- $179 million in dividends. Year-to-date, total buybacks were $1.85 billion ahead of our prior target of $1.7 billion for the year. With an elevated cash position and solid cash generation anticipated in the fourth quarter, we now expect share buybacks for the year to be around $2.2 billion. And we expect to continue our shareholder-friendly capital framework into 2021, as we normalize our cash balance generate healthy cash flow and continue shaping our portfolio. Now switching to our segment outlook. In Integrated Mission Systems, we now anticipate revenues up approximately 6% for the year from the prior range of up 5.5% to 7%, driven by growth in ISR and Maritime. Segment margin is now expected to be about 15%, up 150 basis points versus the prior guidance driven by solid program performance and cost management. At Space and Airborne Systems, we're now guiding to organic revenue growth of approximately 7% within the previous range of up 6% to 7.5%, as higher F-35 revenues continue to drive Mission Avionics. Segment margin guidance remains unchanged at approximately 18.75%. In Communication Systems, organic revenue growth is expected to be approximately 4% and within the prior range of up 3.5% to 5%, mainly driven by modernization strength in DoD tactical radios. Segment margins are now expected to be about 24% a 25 basis point increase from our prior guidance, primarily from mix related to our Tactical business and cost management. And lastly, in Aviation Systems, we now anticipate revenues to be down approximately 3% on an organic basis versus our prior range of down 1% to 5% consistent with our prior estimates in the commercial aero business, partially offset by double-digit growth on the defense side from classified and other programs. Segment margin guidance remains unchanged at 13.25% reflecting the timely and decisive actions to mitigate commercial aero headwinds. So overall, we delivered solid performance in the quarter and year-to-date and now expect to deliver results consistent with our original EPS and free cash flow guidance set back in February. Before wrapping up, I'd like to briefly touch on our outlook post 2020. We'll provide 2021 guidance as we typically do with fourth quarter results. Though note we remain confident in our framework of annual double-digit growth in earnings and free cash flow per share, as the building blocks remain the same: mid single-digit top line growth, steady to rising margins, working capital and CapEx discipline and returning our free cash flow to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. With that I'll ask the operator to open up the line for questions. Sure. Myles in the third quarter, we increased a little bit relative to the proceeds about $150 million. If you just do the math, I would say $350 million here in Q4. You can back into our free cash flow for the fourth quarter. And with the dividends we're approaching kind of the framework that Bill just mentioned as far as returning free cash flow to shareholders. Yes, there could be a little bit more room there. I mean our balance is elevated with $1.3 billion at the end of September. Given where we are with the guidance we just gave you, we would expect the balance to continue to remain elevated in December. And so there could be opportunity there. We're also evaluating other items which could include some pension contributions but -- so we're leaving our optionality open a little bit. But if it doesn't happen in this quarter then it would carry over into next year. So, Sheila it's a great question. If you think about it maybe in kind of a little bit bigger picture, we end the year this year we'll be at 17.75% for the year around that ballpark. We do have incremental synergies next year $50 million. That equates to anywhere around 25, 30 basis points of expansion. Our core E3 productivity is obviously going to be a driver for us, but we do have some mixed headwinds that we'll be dealing with and we deal with that every year. And so our intent always is to drive more than the mix headwinds. But I think for now right now as we're continuing to go through the planning offsetting one for one is where we stand at the moment. The only thing I'll say is that we will see a little bit of a headwind in Q1 because of the -- just the roll-through of the commercial the pandemic-related impacts roll through the four quarters. And so that will put a little bit of pressure on Q1 which will also have an impact obviously on the full year. But having said that I think mix is something we just have to keep an eye on, but our core E3 productivity is intended to offset that on a kind of run rate basis and drive. Once we get beyond the synergy period in the integration period, our core E3 operating excellence program will continue to be a driver of margins for us. Well, no, I think, I'd comment some of the new awards that we talked about. Just I think it demonstrates and is illustrative of our positioning for the modernization trends that we're seeing going forward. And so while people may want to focus on O&M budgets and historical tactical radios, the new awards that we're winning are really positioning us well for the trends that we're seeing in terms of defense priority spending. And so I think you should as Bill mentioned think about our portfolio and our revenue potential more in that broader context. And that's what gives us confidence in our mid single-digit growth over and we're seeing this in our new awards right now. Sure George. Thanks. The progress payment benefit this year is in the range of say around close to $100 million in that ballpark maybe a little bit lower than that. That one, we basically have offset with small supplier payments. And so it's just one for one as it's come in. We really pushed supplier payments out. On the payroll tax benefit, that's kind of $150 million plus in that ballpark, similar type of effort. We've kind of put a placeholder there to support supply chain there as well. That as you know, will be paid back over two years 2021 and 2022. But I would say, as it relates to kind of longer-term targets and our $3 billion target, there's a number of puts and takes. There's risks and opportunities. We've got that factored in. We feel good about our ability to generate continued working capital improvement and we don't see that getting in the way of us getting to $3 billion in 2022."

            "content": "Thank you, Rajeev and good morning, everyone. So two years ago this month, we announced the merger of L3 and Harris. And thanks to the hard work and perseverance of our employees, we've been able to deliver results consistent with or better than expectations, despite market volatility and unforeseen obstacles like COVID. Their efforts have led to another strong quarter and put us in a position to raise our 2020 guidance. The mitigation plans we implemented earlier in the year to manage COVID-19 have proven effective in keeping our employees safe and our facilities open and will remain in place for the foreseeable future. We also continue to support our supply chain through accelerated payments, totaling over $200 million in the quarter and nearly $0.5 billion year-to-date and we expect these advances will continue in the fourth quarter. Earlier today, we reported third quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.84, up a solid 10%. Company margins expanded 60 basis points to 17.9% on organic revenue growth of 4.5% and adjusted free cash flow was $726 million. Our core U.S. and international government businesses were up over 7% including double-digit growth internationally, partially offset by COVID-related impacts on our commercial businesses that were down largely in line with expectations. With another quarter of strong execution on our under our belt, we're improving our outlook for the year and increasing margins, earnings per share and free cash flow to the upper end of the prior range, while narrowing organic revenue growth to the prior midpoint of approximately 4%. It's worth noting that despite the pandemic headwinds, we're back to the midpoint of our initial 2020 earnings per share guide, a testament to the benefits of the merger and our earnings power. Integration activity continued to progress well. And then in the quarter we delivered net cost synergies of $50 million, bringing year-to-date savings to $165 million and well on track to meet our $185 million target this year. At this rate, we'll exit the year with $250 million in net cumulative savings, which positions us to deliver at least $300 million net in 2021, a year ahead of schedule. Our E3 operational excellence program continues to mature and become institutionalized and alongside cost synergies was a key driver of the 60 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter and 130 basis points year-to-date. With our strong performance to date, we're increasing our margin guidance to approximately 17.75% for the year, a 100 basis point improvement from 2019 and a solid base to build on over the medium term. As we look beyond 2020, we see three primary building blocks supporting mid-single-digit top line growth. First, we have a portfolio that is well aligned with national security priorities irrespective of the outcome of the elections. Our broad C5ISR capabilities are essential elements encountering the near-peer threats identified in the National Defense Strategy: resilient communications, open architecture command and control, offensive and defensive cyber and ISR across all spectrums electro optical, infrared, hyperspectral, RF, sonar; and all forms of intelligence, signals, comms, electronic and image. We have leadership positions in many of these areas and operate in all domains. And we've realigned our R&D efforts to extend our position through investments in open architecture, multifunction, software-defined technologies. The security threats are real and we anticipate that future defense budgets will continue to prioritize spending in these areas where we're well positioned and we're investing. Second, we uniquely benefit from the revenue synergy opportunities created in a merger of two complementary companies that expanded our addressable market. This quarter we received an additional 12 revenue synergy awards bringing the total down selected proposals to 25 out of 37 for a cumulative value of over $300 million, an initial down payment on our multi-billion dollar pipeline. Two recent wins worth highlighting are the Space Development Agency's tracking layer, which leveraged legacy Harris' strength in space payloads and integration with L3's onboard space avionics solutions. The other is SAFE-SiM, a DARPA program to simulate and train for future multi-domain battle that addresses the challenge of secured data sharing of highly classified sensors. And third, we see upside in international which at about 20% of revenue is underrepresented versus peers. With a now larger international footprint, we can better leverage our scale and extensive sales channels and capitalize on our domestic position to support global modernization efforts and extend our ISR leadership in the airborne, land and maritime domains. And as seen with recent awards this quarter to deliver missionized aircraft to both Canada and the Royal Australian Air Force, we're making progress. Our top-line and margin opportunities along with our discipline around working capital and CapEx support our free cash flow potential as well as our ability to return capital to shareholders. We're off to a good start to-date and now expect to deliver free cash flow of approximately $2.65 billion to $2.7 billion for the year at the top end of our prior guidance. This performance coupled with divestiture proceeds has enabled us to return over $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders in the third quarter, which put share repurchases to-date at $1.85 billion ahead of our full year 2020 commitment of $1.7 billion. For the full year, we now expect share repurchases to be about $2.2 billion, a pace we plan to sustain through next year. On portfolio reshaping, we're about one-third of the way through our bottoms-up target of divesting 8% to 10% of revenues and activity continues to be robust. Our criteria and strategy haven't changed as a result of recent events. We continue to be patient and persistent as we look to maximize value. And as previously stated, we will announce divestitures as they occur with proceeds primarily used for capital returns. So overall, we're executing well despite the uncertain times. And with our unique revenue, margin and cash opportunities we remain focused on delivering double-digit earnings and free cash flow per share. So with that, I'll turn it over to Chris to discuss segment results. Chris? So Myles, I'll start on the second one and maybe I'll ask Jay to come back on the first one on the buyback. Look on capital returns, we -- the philosophy really is 100% of our free cash flow coming back to owners in repurchases or dividends and we see that through next year. We've been leaning pretty heavily into share buybacks and Jay will talk in a minute about our philosophy there. Based on our share price, we think that that's a good value. We do see our dividend with some room to move up. We've been up about 25% in our dividend rate since close. We had raised it twice once at close and once at the beginning of this year. But at about 28% of our free cash flow being paid out, it's below the bottom end of our range. And we'll expect to take a hard look at that early next year and probably lean a little bit heavier into our dividend. But broadly, all of our cash will come back to owners plus divestiture proceeds through at least next year. Jay, you want to talk about the buyback? So, right now as you'll see in the Q, our funded and unfunded backlog at the end of Q3 was about $20 billion. And you'll note there about two-thirds of it 65% rolls out through calendar 2021. So, we think that that part of our business is pretty solid. We've got a very good pipeline $69 billion. It's come up over the last quarter. It's come up about 8% or 10% since the beginning of the year. So, it continues to grow be very robust. And as we look into next year and to Jay's points about mid-single-digit growth we see good solid growth in our core U.S. government businesses. You've heard a couple of our peers talk about low to mid-single-digit growth there. We will add on top of that with revenue synergies that we've talked quite a bit about. We see international growing. It's a growth business for us here in the back half. Book-to-bill was very good. The pipeline is really strong internationally. We see that being a contributor into next year. And certainly as Jay just mentioned about commercial, it will be a little bit of a headwind until we lap one year on COVID. But the other dimensions will be pretty strong going to next year. Well, first on '22 it's a little bit further out in the future, but I might -- maybe answer the first part of the question as Chris thinks about if he wants to give any guidance on '22. But we're making really good progress on the revenue synergies. And I think this has been a pleasant surprise to all of us in terms of the pace and magnitude of getting that revenue opportunity. I think, it points to the strategic rationale of the combination and the complementary nature of the technology that we're working on. So again, we're about 80 proposals that have been submitted. It's come up from Q3. We're winning quite a few of them. 25 out of 37 is pretty healthy with $300 million of awards. We talked about a couple of these are some of the -- certainly the SDA win is one of the bigger ones. But generally speaking, they're going to be in the space domain electronic warfare, some in maritime. And there's quite a lot that's happening in the classified domain. As we said over multiple calls, one of the things that was unique here is, as we put our companies together, we got a lot of input and feedback from our classified customers, who really see across our portfolio and across other missions across other companies and really giving us strong guidance as to where there might be opportunities to combine capabilities within L3Harris. And the team has worked very hard to put together some compelling proposals and we continue to win. So, it's modest growth this year. It will start to grow next year and be a good contributor in 2021 and certainly more beyond that. It will grow to hundreds of millions over the next year or two which I think is a very positive sign for not just winning them, but actually seeing them come through in revenue opportunity. So, I'm really, really pleased here Gautam on sort of the revenue synergy. I don't know Chris maybe answer the question on '22 if you want to take a stab at that one. And I think Jay's comment about the mid-single-digit framework kind of expand -- spans a bit more than one year. Thank you, Gautam. So David thanks for the question. Look, as I mentioned earlier about two-thirds of our backlog coming out of Q3 what you'll see in the Q is around 20 -- a little over $20 billion funded and unfunded rolls out over the next year. And what I've seen over time is it's hard to compare our portfolio sort of short long cycle versus peers. But certainly, it has lengthened over the last several years as some of the programs that we worked on specifically in tactical radios have moved from sort of book and ship, a quick turn to replenish spares or radios in Iraq and Afghanistan to now being fundamental long-term programs of record which a lot more -- longer visibility in terms of the buying pattern the spending outlook. So, we certainly see our portfolio being longer term than we were several years ago. And certainly, combining with L3, I think puts us in that position as well. So again, I think our portfolio is very sound. It's robust. We're well positioned to grow into next year. So Pete, it's a very good question. Look, you know what -- and I took some pains in my comments to talk about the broad set of C5ISR capability we've had across the company. And when you break down C5 and ISR into its components and domains different sensing technologies, we've got a very strong position across all of them, all of which are essential in enabling this JADC2 or Joint All-Domain Command and Control vision of the future. We're a strong player there. I think on ABMS we've -- lots of players on the IDIQ, but we are across all seven business areas which is somewhat unique. We had content on Project Convergence which is sort of the Army version of that in partnership with the Air Force. We had a lot of content there and we'll hope to see more as it gets into the next version of it next year. We're very strong in maritime and distributed maritime operations. So we believe this is a strength of ours. We've got very strong capabilities in comms resilient communications which is developing very strong resilient wave forms. L3 was -- had a strength there. We had certainly a strength there, very strong ISR. So to me we're right in the middle of this. And I think it's fundamental that JADC2 or that vision that concept is going to be required in a near-peer competition. It's going to be more about the capabilities on platforms and how they inter-operate as opposed to the platforms themselves. And when I think about this powerhouse that we've created here at L3Harris, Pete I think we're right going to be in the middle of it. It will grow over time. There's funding there and we're confident that's going to be a driver for the company over time. It's hard to size it today, but we believe it's going to be pretty important Pete. Good morning Richard. Hey Richard thanks for the question. I think you're hitting on a very important topic and that is the power of the IRAD that we spend and the work that's happened over the last five quarters. We're spending in the 3.6% 3.8% of our revenue in that range. We think it's sized well. And I think more importantly what the team has done is worked very hard over the last five quarters to make sure, it's spent on the best highest-value highest-return opportunities and focusing that spear we call IRAD.  We've reduced the number of projects by about 30%. We moved about 10% of the dollars around to really be placed on the technology the areas that we think will have the best returns or aligned to revenue opportunities, revenue synergies. And the second element of it is making -- not just putting the -- making sure we're spending on the right projects, but also doing it efficiently. So we've got good opportunities to drive operational excellence skills into the way we develop products. We're pushing hard on digital engineering on DevOps and a lot of our work is software development. There's lots of ways to improve the effectiveness of our R&D spend. And to me this is going to be a very powerful driver of growth in the future. I don't see it stepping up materially from where we're at. I think it's at a good amount. It will come up with revenue in the terms of a dollar perspective, but I think we're spending a healthy amount on R&D. So Doug I'll start here maybe going to ask Chris to jump in. I don't think we're going to be much affected by redeployment of overseas troops back onshore. I don't think that's going to be a big driver of growth either a top headwind or a tailwind. On end strength it would come back to things like businesses like night vision goggle or radios where those are distributed out to individual soldiers. But frankly we're on the front end of a modernization ramp, even through the next five years. We're not even 40% through the modernization ramp in -- with radio. So even if end strength comes down as I expect it likely will, I don't think it's going to affect the growth rate in our radio business. I think you are so far underpenetrated with new technology both night vision, as well as radios that we still see good growth opportunities there. So if anything reduced end strength might actually free up some dollars to be put onto modernization investments that really affect a broad part of our business. I don't know if Chris you wanted to add to that? Good morning, Noah. Well, yes, go ahead. Hey, good morning, Rob. So, yeah, as we talked earlier this year right after I think it was Q1 maybe Q2 as we looked at the international business we saw it being more flattish for the year. We saw the first half being down a little bit the back half growing and being about flat for the year. Q3 came in strong like we had expected it would a little bit better than we had thought. So it could be up a little bit, so flat to up low single-digits internationally, so a little better than we saw a couple of months ago. International tactical has come in almost exactly as we had expected. You could see the numbers up 21% in the third quarter. We expect the fourth quarter up a similar amount. So we see good recovery in that business. A lot of it is Middle East, Europe, Asia-Pacific mostly Australia and New Zealand. So, there's pretty good growth in tactical. And we've got a nice pipeline of opportunities. I think the number is about $20 billion of international opportunities. The book-to-bill year-to-date is over 1 about 1.06 or so. We see the fourth quarter looking -- shaping up to be pretty sizable in terms of book-to-bill looks pretty good. About $3 billion of those proposals that are out there of our pipeline is in proposal. So it's actually getting to be more nearer term. So it's looking a little bit more encouraging than we thought just a couple of months ago. I think Chris and the team are putting a lot of focus on this. We have resources in place going after 10 focused countries and we're starting to turn the corner. So we're at 20% roughly in terms of our revenue. We expect it's going to grow several points over the next number of years. I don't know Chris if you want to state a goal there but it's going to come up from where we are because it's underrepresented in our portfolio today. Yes. Thanks, Peter. Yeah, so seven days year-to-date it's about 13 days operationally since the close. So we put out our divestitures and purchase accounting. We will see towards the back end of the year. We'll probably stay right on 55 days. So, you won't see seven-days improvement over three quarters as the continued pace into the future. We see the 55 dropping below 50 over the next couple of years three to four days per year. That gets us to the $3 billion goal in calendar 2022. We still see an opportunity to get down to the low 40s or about 40 days. Certainly, that's where legacy Harris was. We've seen our peers at that point. So even after calendar 2022 47, 48 days we see opportunity to continue to prove working capital beyond that. As I said last time and we've talked about this a number of times a lot of it is going to be on inventory. So we've got a lot of opportunity here. We know where it's at. We've got 10 businesses that we're really focused on that drive 75% of our working capital six with more than 75 days. So we know where we're focused. We're driving it hard. We review these every single week. And you can see the progress and trajectory that we happen to be on. So, again, about three to four days a year beyond calendar 2020. Hey, John, look it's a good question. I mean I think we're really performing better than we had expected on margins even through this year. Keep in mind, we started the year I think guiding to 17% to 17.5%. And now, today it's 17.75%. So in an era of COVID, which actually dinged us about 40 basis points this year, so we're performing very, very well. It comes through the synergy drop-through. It comes through operational excellence, which is maturing at a fast clip. Jay has talked about 18% or so next year. He gave you some of the drivers. Will it go up beyond that? It will likely move up. I don't know if and when it will hit 20%. I think the key thing to be thinking about is we got to make sure that we're leaning in to go after and drive revenue growth capturing some opportunities, which might have a near-term short-term impact on margins, but long term be good businesses for the overall enterprise. We got to make sure we continue to invest at the level required to grow the business on a long-term basis. Anyone could easily pull back investment like IRAD, and drive margin up in the near term, but be detrimental on long-term value for the owners. I think you have to work the pedals here, and I think we do this very, very effectively. So we can't commit to something beyond next year, but we will commit to continue to work the agenda to drive hard on technology investments which drive differentiation and good cost management lean productivity across the whole company. Good morning, Ron. Okay. So let me hit on a couple of points there, Ron. But you're right a lot of it's classified in terms of its nature. But it's about 20% of our total company revenue is classified. And as you know, the classified budgets both military and national intelligence programs. Those budgets have come up over the last five or six years. They're at a very healthy level. And that does offer some cushion, if you will, as you go into the next several years. If there's more pressure on the non-classified DoD budget, money tends to move and be well supported in the classified domain. And even the elements of that of what's in the classified budget, which is around $85 billion plus or minus between military and national intelligence programs, the elements are actually moving in a direction, which we believe supports a lot of the investments we've made. So, a lot of we focus on is in the space domain, various new technologies for optics RF systems, driving to larger constellations from prototypes running a full end-to-end mission solution. I think what's an interesting element of this is, historically, a lot of the space domain was dominated by the intelligence community. But, because of the lower cost faster time to market, more onboard processing of our small satellites, it's opening up new markets within the DoD. So the addressable base for us is actually expanding, and that's helping us quite a bit. So it's really on the space domain, but there's plenty of other classified opportunities on the land in Maritime domains as well. We've got a strong position really across all of them. So it's hard to shape them, but it gets back to the comment I made on the strength of C5ISR. And a lot of the things that we do in the classified domain leverage off of that, we hone technologies advanced technologies, and then you can leverage that benefit into the non-class environment. And that's been a strategy of the company for a number of years Ron, and I think it's worked pretty well. Rob, it's a very, very good question. So the landscape is changing. We are seeing greater penetration of some of the Western companies Silicon Valley companies, SpaceX you mentioned. As you know, they were one of the awardees of the SDA tracking layer. We could follow what they've done in commercial launch and with Starlink and other things. So they're playing more. There's a number of other companies. You mentioned a few of them. There are some more typical government contractors who are looking to expand what they do into -- from services to other components. So, the market is moving around and we get it. The way we stay ahead is basically running our strategy, running our game which is really strong investments and performance in R&D and technology moving quickly. There's really nobody that's put up a smallsat with the capability we had and the time frame we've done it just in the last couple of years. And I think that's the way we stay ahead. We continue to drive cost out drive operational excellence, improve quality and meet our program objectives. And I think if we do that and we continue to accelerate the pace at which we can execute on our programs and technologies we're going to stay ahead. I think that's what we need to do. Will M&A play a role in that? Maybe over time. Right now, we're focused on integration our portfolio shaping. But as you go out in time, there could be pieces of other companies or things on the market that could become available to fill a gap in our portfolio. We don't see that today but that's very positive. In fact, it's probably likely it's going to happen over time. But today, we're focused on running our game, and I think that's been an effective strategy. So, Rob thanks for the question. It was very good. I really appreciate that. Let me just wrap up from here. And I want to thank again the L3Harris team. They've done a fantastic job of staying focused to meeting our customer commitments. They work very, very hard, and that hard work has led to another quarter of very strong results. We're well positioned coming into next -- into the year-end and into the coming years. And I look forward to our next update. Thank you very much everybody for joining us today. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the L3Harris Technologies Second Quarter Calendar Year 2020 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you, Michelle. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2020 earnings call. On the call with me today are Bill Brown, our CEO; Chris Kubasik, our COO; and Jay Malave, our CFO. First, a few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumption, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our press release, presentation and our SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website which is l3harris.com where a replay of this call will also be available. And to aid with year-over-year comparability, following the L3Harris merger, prior-year results will be on a pro forma basis. With that, Bill, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.\nBill Brown: Okay. Well, thank you, Rajeev and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking L3Harris employees for their hard work and dedication of over the last several months. The pandemic has challenged us all to find new ways of working effectively. And our team has responded well to ensure we continue to meet the mission critical needs of our customers even as the virus spreads across southern states, where we have a large presence. And as the environment evolves, the health and safety of our employees will remain our top priority. All of our facilities are up and running and adhering to well-established protocols such as daily health screenings, face coverings, social distancing and adjusted work schedules. Our work from home policy remains in place for about half our workforce. And we are prepared to operate under these conditions over the coming quarters. We continue to pay close attention to our supply base and monitor our risk position daily and we've successfully implemented mitigation plans where needed, including developing alternative sourcing, providing on-site assistance and working with local authorities to secure closure exemptions. In addition, we accelerated nearly $250 million in supplier payments within the quarter and we plan to continue that support through year end. We're also doing our fair share to support our communities' health care workers and first responders through the pandemic. And we continue to hire aggressively to meet our growth needs, adding about 3,000# employees through June and bringing on board our largest cohort of interns and new college grads ever. Chris and Jay will walk through the details in a minute but as you saw earlier today we reported second quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.83, up a solid 13% against a tough backdrop. Company margins increased 150 basis points to 18.2% and adjusted free cash flow was $785 million, all above expectations. Reported revenue was flat but adjusted for divestitures was up about 2.5% as strong 8% growth in our core U.S. government-related businesses more than offset a modest decline on the international side and a 35% drop in our small commercial businesses, consistent with what we anticipated. Total company funded book-to-bill was 1.09 with funded backlog growing about 5% since the beginning of the year when adjusted for divestitures. Our strategic priorities have remained the same since we closed on the merger a year ago. And we're proud that our nearly 50,000 employees quickly aligned as one operating company. And we're pleased with how well the team is executing and avoiding operational missteps despite the many moving parts. Integration continues to progress well with net synergy savings of $60 million in the quarter and $115 million year-to-date. We have not seen a slowdown in activity due to COVID and now believe we can deliver $185 million in net savings this year, up $20 million from prior estimate, largely due to a steady ramp in savings from the supply chain, shared services and benefits. Our integration roadmap is very methodical and rigorous with a weekly cadence of top-down reviews and we continue to expect to achieve $300 million in cumulative net savings in calendar 2021, one year ahead of original plan. We're making good progress and driving a culture of operational excellence deep into the company and through the quarter, we continue to hold training sessions and conduct lean assessments, quality clinics and value engineering events despite the inability to travel. As we've said before, e3savings are additive to synergies and we're a key part of the margin expansion we achieved in the quarter and year-to-date. But more importantly are essential to expanding margins beyond the integration window. Investments in technology and innovation remain at the top of our agenda and are key to long-term revenue growth. Since the closing, we fully implemented a rigorous stage gate process called Checkpoint and cut 30% of IRAD projects to sharpen our focus on key strategic themes around spectrum superiority, actionable intelligence and war fighter effectiveness, while positioning for the shift to an integrated networked battlefield. We are investing heavily in multi-function, software-defined, open architecture systems that allow us to deliver mission solutions independent of the platform. These investments are evident and are increasing traction on revenue synergies; we've now been down selected on 13 out of 23 proposals and continued to build on our multi-billion pipeline. While we're still in the early innings, the collaboration we're seeing across segments is really impressive with the process to identify new revenue synergy opportunities nearly self-sustaining. On portfolio reshaping, we are set to close today on the divestiture of EOTech, a small consumer-facing business bringing total transactions to date to four with proceeds exceeding $1 billion. We're now about one-third of the way toward our bottoms-up estimate of divesting 8% to 10% of revenue with more progress expected in the coming quarters as we increase our focus on businesses where we're best positioned to win. And on maximizing cash generation, we delivered $785 million of free cash flow in the quarter and about $2.7 billion on a LTM basis, growth of over 20% on a per share basis. Our strong performance along with divestiture proceeds drove a cash balance of $2 billion at quarter end and supports our prior commitment to return capital to shareholders in the third quarter. Longer term, we see a clear path to achieving $3 billion free cash flow in calendar 2022, driven in part by continued improvement in working capital. In the quarter, we achieved another two day sequential improvement with solid momentum toward a calendar 2022 goal of sub 50-days from 68 at merger close adjusted for divestitures and accounting items. Slide 4 illustrates the opportunity ahead of us. 10 businesses account for about 75% of our working capital, six of which have more than 75 days on hand, driving those six the current company average of 55 days would generate nearly $0.5 billion of cash flow with the largest opportunity tied to lower inventory. Shorter cycle times, better forecasting, product rationalization and part commonization, vendor managed inventory and improved supplier delivery performance. The levers are clear. We've done it before and the team is focused and motivated to get it done. Finally, we're all watching carefully the progress towards a 2021 defense budget and signals from Congress, the Biden campaign and the Trump administration on the budget trajectory in 2022 and beyond. We're encouraged by the bipartisan support in advancing the fiscal 2021 National Defense Authorization Act through the house and senate and we believe that the heightened threat environment will drive the trajectory of U.S military spending regardless of the election. And while we're conscious of the risks surrounding elevated deficits, we believe our technological capabilities and opportunity set position as well over the coming years. Recent house and senate marks support this as we saw ongoing strength in areas like tactical radio, aircraft ISR, F-35 and space and classified budgets are also set to be well supported. So between budget positioning, revenue synergies, margin expansion potential and shareholder friendly capital deployment, we remain confident in our ability to sustain double-digit earnings and free cash flow growth per share in the medium term. And with that I'll now turn it over to Chris Kubasik to discuss segment results. Chris?\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Thank you, Bill and good morning, everyone. I'd like to highlight the quarterly segment results starting on slide 6. Integrated Mission Systems increased revenue 7% from growth in our Electro Optical and Maritime Businesses with ISR relatively flat in the quarter, but expected to pick up in the back half of the year. Operating income was up 38% and margin expanded 370 basis points to 16.8% from integration benefits, operational excellence and cost management. Order momentum at IMS was broad-based with a funded book- to-bill above 1.0 in each business resulting in an overall segment book-to-bill of 1.19 for the quarter and 1.12 since the merger. Our highlight in recent months has been the traction we've seen in our maritime business. In the quarter, we received an order from a classified customer for an unmanned surface vehicle. And just this month, we were selected as the prime contractor for the medium unmanned surface vehicle for the U.S navy. We're also in the process of finalizing our position on the U.S navy's frigate program as a system integrator this initial 10-ship contract has a potential value of over $300 million. So clearly, we're seeing positive momentum in this business. On slide 7, Space and Airborne Systems revenue increased 4% in the quarter. Growth in Avionics from the production and modernization ramp of the F-35 and increased classified work at Intel and cyber were partially offset by program transition timing and a tough compare in the space business. Segment operating income was up 3% and margin contracted 20 basis points to 18.8% as operational excellence and integration benefits were offset by program mix from increased developmental work and investments in earlier stage technologies. Overall funded book-to-bill was 0.94 for the quarter and just below 1 since the merger, with particular strength in space, which delivered a book-to-bill over 1.0 in the quarter. As a reminder, in our space business, we are transitioning from a legacy exquisite payload provider to a full end-to-end systems provider for responsive satellite and ground systems. A recent launch for the U.S Air Force demonstrated this capability. We designed, developed and built satellites within a couple years and are now providing the tasking and the command and control for these on-orbit spacecraft. This speed to market is a significant differentiator compared to legacy systems that take nearly a decade to become operational. As war fighting capabilities accelerate in the space domain, we are well positioned to participate and capture new business and have a strong pipeline that exceeds $10 billion to support growth in the medium and long term. On slide 8, Communication Systems revenue was up 2.5% for the quarter as DoD tactical and integrated vision systems benefited from modernization demand, both were up double digits. This strength was partially offset by international tactical radio sales timing and headwinds at our public safety business both of which were down in the mid-teens consistent with prior expectations. Segment operating income was up 11% and margin expanded 190 basis points to 23.9% from integration benefits and cost management. Turning to orders, DoD tactical modernization momentum continued with a $95 million award for an additional low rate production contract on the US army's HMS Manpack. After completion of the operational testing early next year, we anticipate a full rate production award against the previously announced IDIQ of nearly $13 billion. This will support continued revenue growth. Lastly on slide 9, Aviation Systems organic revenue decreased 7% in the quarter with commercial aviation down about 50% due to the pandemic in line with our expectations. This headwind was partially offset by continued growth within the classified areas at defense aviation products, which was up in the mid-teens. Operating income was down 8% primarily due to the impact of divestitures, but would have grown 4% otherwise. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 12.5% from operational efficiencies, integration benefits and cost actions, partially offset by COVID related headwinds. Orders significantly outpaced sales leading to a funded segment book-to-bill of 1.26 for the quarter and 1.13 since the merger. We saw considerable traction on the defense side for airborne radars, ground vehicle systems and training solutions, as well as within the classified arena. One of the key wins in the quarter was the $900 million single award IDIQ to develop and manage simulator requirements and standards across the Air Force's training portfolio. This solution will leverage open systems architecture and set common standards for the Air Force and aligns with the DoD move towards multi-domain operations and ties to the program direction of JAB C2. It will also position us well for future military training offerings. So before handing it over to Jay, I'd like to echo Bill's comments and thank our employees for their dedication, focus and hard work during the pandemic. We'll continue to prioritize your health and safety as we move forward. With that over to you Jay.\nJay Malave: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a recap of second quarter results then provide an update on the impact of COVID and then wrap up with guidance. In the quarter, organic revenue was up nearly 2.5% as 8% growth in our US government business more than offset the commercial decline. EBIT increased 9% on 18.2% margins resulting in EPS growth of 13% or 0.32 as shown on slide 10. Of this growth $0.22 came from synergies, $0.15 from operations including cost management and $0.13 from share count, pension and other items including divestitures, partially offset by pandemic related headwinds of $0.18 mainly from our commercial businesses. Free cash flow for the quarter was $785 million and we ended the period with 55 working capital days or two days better sequentially after adjusting for divestitures and purchase accounting adjustments, versus the prior year and our expectations we benefited from accelerating customer collections and ongoing inventory management, while continuing to support our suppliers. Margins in the quarter came in at 18.2% or 150 basis points higher than last year and ahead of our internal views. Most of the expansion or 140 basis points came from the $60 million synergies drop through. We also saw benefits from our cost management efforts and tailwinds from reduced expenses such as for travel and trade shows. Along with operational efficiencies which more than offset 60 basis points of COVID headwind. While some of the expense tailwinds are temporary, our margin performance highlights the portfolio's resiliency during a tough environment and our future earnings potential. Next let's turn to slide 11 for details on the guidance outlook. Organic revenue is unchanged at up 3% to 5% % with top line trending as expected. And overall COVID impacts still sized within our prior range. For our core US government business representing about of 75% sales, we expect the 8% first half growth to carry over to the back half as well. And for our commercial aerospace businesses, which were down about 50% in the quarter, it's generally tracking to our previous forecast for the year and in line with broader industry forecasts. In public safety, the business was down in the mid-teens in the quarter and we now expect that business to decline around 15% from 10% previously, reflecting the slow pace of new awards. On international, we're holding our flattest view for the year based on our second half visibility with upside opportunity in ISR. So overall relatively minor changes with a clear line of sight to our sales outlook, which is supported by a funded book-to-bill of 1.1 in the first half. Shifting the margins. We've increased our outlook to 17.5% plus with the plus indicating potential upside of 10 to 20 basis points versus the prior guidance of 17.5%. Due to performance to date. cost synergies, E3 progress and expense management. Margins step back in the second half versus the second quarter due to higher R&D investment as well as a placeholder for higher COVID related mitigation costs or disruptions, but still continued margin expansion progress on the full year of nearly 100 basis points. On EPS, we're holding the full year guidance range of $11.15 to $11.55 with the contingency at the midpoint from the margin up side to account for the uncertain backdrop amid to pandemic's progression. On capital allocation, we're in a strong cash position and should remain so after completing our committed repurchases with divesture proceeds here in the third quarter. Beyond that we'll continue to monitor market conditions for deployment opportunities such as capital returns and employee pension plan contributions. Moving to free cash flow, our guide of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion remains intact with similar upward pressure from earnings upside, working capital traction and lighter CapEx. Finally and briefly on the segment outlook. We've maintained our guidance for all line items but for margins at IMS, where we see likely upside. The improvement is coming from synergy drop through and operational excellence via E3 productivity. Both year-to-date and going forward. So a great example of the merger benefits. So to put it all together, a solid growth outlook supported by our year-to-date performance and forward visibility. With an upside bias assuming a stabilizing environment. And with that I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSethSeifman: Hey. Thanks very much and good morning, everyone. Bill you talk in the slides about the potential for cash flow growth beyond 2022 and you mentioned your working capital, just wanted to confirm a; is that the chief source of cash flow growth in those out years number one? And b; are there others and if so, kind of what are they? And if you could speak a little bit maybe qualitatively to the magnitude and relative importance of those other drivers?\nBillBrown: Yes. So Seth thanks for the question. So between now and 2022 time frame mid single digit plus type of revenue growth that we expect because we're seeing good visibility in the 2021 budget, which we think is going to get passed sometime in the next six months or so. Our programs are very well supported there. A lot of unspent dollars from prior years, good opportunities on revenue synergies, growth opportunities international. So we see the top line continue to improve, margins coming up, we're doing very well in margin progression this year. Jay just talked about some of the upside drivers here in calendar 2020 we see continued momentum on margins over the next couple of years. It's certainly not going to end as we get to 2020. There's going to be opportunities even certainly beyond that. Working capital is a driver, we've made great progress down 13 days since the close to 55. We see getting to about 50 days or below 50 by the time we get calendar 2022. But that way we look at this from a bottom up perspective, Harris was at 41. We can see our ability getting down into those 40-41 days. So even as we had 50 days in 2022 an extra 10 beyond that's about $350 million worth of cash, which has great opportunity to deploy it. In the near term certainly next year or so towards share buyback that will reduce our share count. So overall you put all those pieces together, we continue to see double-digit growth in free cash per share.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRobertStallard: Thanks so much. Good morning. I think it's a question for both Bill and Chris. I mean I'll see a lot of talk out there about what the trajectory of the DoD budget could be over the next few years. But I was wondering if both of you could maybe frame how different the merge company is today versus what you saw in the last defense downturn. And how things could play out?\nBillBrown: Well, I mean I'll start and I'll let maybe Chris jump in here, Rob. So that's -- it's a great question, look, I think part of the reason why almost two years ago now Chris and I contemplating putting the company together was really to build a more scaled mission solutions, priming Chris talked a lot about becoming a sixth prime. When we sit there in fact when we talked about our merger back in October of 2018, we talked about our presence connecting across all domains a CP or ISR powerhouse company mission solutions prime company. And you can see based on the progression we've seen to-date clearly moving in that direction. Certainly as the DoD moves towards connecting all of their platforms, all sensors, all shooters across all domains. I see us be really being in the sweet spot of that. We've won 7 IDIQs on ABMS. There's a lot of players on the team, but I think it's testament to the capability that this organization has overall in spectrum superiority, spectrum dominance across what we do in electronic warfare, waveforms, communications, ISR, all those pieces come together to help realize that vision of where the DoD needs to move to in order to fight the next fight. You can see really across all domains. The progress in space, the progress in unmanned both airborne and maritime. So we're really I think realizing that vision and I think we're a much more resilient organization today we would have been several years ago with a tremendous opportunity to gain share in a market that may flatten or come down over time. So I think we're just a fundamentally different position today we were a number of years ago. I don't know, if you want to add, Chris.\nChrisKubasik: Yes, maybe I'll just add a little bit, Rob. We talked a lot about leveraging the scale of the enterprise and I think in this industry scale matters and you look at this new company with close to $700 million of R&D that positions us well for these new markets and NextGen opportunities. So we're starting with the clean sheet. I believe we're pretty agile and responsive. The national defense strategy talks about disaggregation. Bill mentioned autonomy and some of the capabilities we have there fit nicely with these large platforms and then the ability to connect them. And you look at our ability to attract and hire college grads and others, there's a lot of excitement with this new company. People see that we're growing 8% in the government business and I think we're ahead of schedule and going better than I would have expected after 13-months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nCarterCopeland: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for the time. I hope everybody's well. Bill, I wondered or Chris, I wondered if you might tell us a little bit more about this comments on trimming the IRAD pipeline or narrowing the focus of that IRAD pipeline, just help us think through the price prioritization and that thought process. Are you looking to prioritize capabilities or ROIs or customers, any granularity you can give us on how you're thinking through that process? Thanks.\nBillBrown: Hey, Carter. It's a great question and it really I'm glad you asked it because I think it's a fundamental part of the value creation story that we have in front of us. We've been talking about this for a couple of years of taking, as Chris just mentioned $700 million worth of IRAD that previously was distributed very deeply and broadly across the company not centrally coordinated, no clear business rationale across the individual investments and through the work that CTO Ross has done here to really get at and categorize where all that money is going. We looked at it; we saw 30% of the projects that were -- didn't have a business case or were overlapping were duplicates. And we've provided two investors some examples of that, so allows us to focus that firepower that's pretty potent on a smaller set of opportunities really around the areas around multi-function, open systems architecture, software-defined everything that really is the heart of what we're trying to do in spectrum superiority, sensing solutions, delivering actionable intelligence. That's where we're really focused and as I think about this that's -- that is going to enable us to continue to invest in these new opportunities that we're seeing coming through in revenue synergies. We've won quite a few here. They're small today in terms of revenue impact. They'll grow over time but the pipeline is large, is getting bigger and really positions us and I think in a fundamentally different way. So when you think about value creation, a potential into the future for a technology company we call L3Harris, this is fundamental to the value creation story.\nChrisKubasik: And I'll just chime in Carter, I mean; this is what we've been talking about for almost a year and internally and externally. This is about optimizing the enterprise the greater good of L3Harris versus optimizing the divisions and this is part of the transition from more of a holding company to an operating company. And when we look at things holistically from the top down, we're able to prioritize those to get the greater growth and the greater returns. Same process applies to CapEx and everything else that Bill, Jay and I look at on a regular basis. So that's the origin of the 30% that Bill referenced.\nOperator: Thank you our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nNoahPoponak: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me, okay? Great. I'd love to get a little more specific on the capital deployment plan and specifically the intent to buy back stock, just given the large cash balance at the end of the quarter and how much free cash you're set to generate moving forward here. And if there's going to be even more proceeds from divestitures. One, will you restart in the third quarter on an underlying basis even before the Leidos proceeds like are we just buying back stock again now or not. And when I add up all those pieces, it looks like you could be buying back several billion dollars a year going forward. Is that a reasonable assumption?\nBillBrown: Yes. So, Noah, look in Q3, we will use the proceeds we received from the sale of SDS to Leidos, was $1 billion we closed that out in Q2. We'll deploy that back to owners as we've always said we would in Q3 we sold an asset and we're buying back an asset, happy to be our stock. As we look to the back end of the year with a $1.3 billion, 3 billion four-ish in free cash generation in the second half. We'll end the year with a pretty strong balance of cash in the [one seven one eight] kind of $1 billion range. So still opportunities beyond that for deployment as we've been talking a lot we see that growing $3 billion by 2022. There's no debt pay down requirements at all, we'll refinance some debt but at 1.7 going to1.5 leverage ratio. We've got, I think a good leverage basis we don't see any significant M&A on the near term horizon. So it gives a lot of opportunity to deploy that upward to $3 billion a year in free cash generation back to owners as we said we would. And that just to remind everybody is after significant investments in development internally hiring people, training people, spending investment on capital driving IRAD at close to 4% as Chris mentioned a couple of minutes ago significant investments inside the company even with that gives us an opportunity to deploy that cash effectively with shareholders.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nGautamKhanna: Thanks. Good morning, guys. How you doing good? Hey, I wanted to ask Bill if you could maybe numerically express the revenue synergy opportunity in some reasonable time frame. So whether it's 2022 and 2023, what should we be anticipating, so what you're going to get incrementally from some of these captures you're pursuing that combine the capabilities of L3 and Harries. And how do you see that playing out over the next 5 or 10 years. Could give a quantification of it?\nBillBrown: Yes. So again we won 13, it's in the tens of millions of dollars and it's actually growing it's -- we're seeing good traction there. You'll see it a little bit in the 2020 results will start to grow in 2021, little bit beyond that. The pipeline itself is north of $5 billion and it's growing every time we meet with the team. And it's pretty substantial. The opportunities that we want are in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion of lifetime revenue. So I would expect I don't commit Chris and Jay to something here, so maybe I'll let Chris jump in here but I would expect that it'll be something growing north of $100 million a year, but Chris maybe you could add.\nChrisKubasik: Yes, no. I'll sign up to at least $100 million a year and would you say 10 years from now, no, it's as Bill said it's going better than we expected. And we have a very strict definition of what we're calling revenue synergy. These are bids that neither company would have submitted had we not merged together. So we're getting the momentum, a lot of these are the initial wins some from DARPA, some from rapid capability office and then we got a win from four to two to one but we like the momentum. And I would expect that this will contribute to our top line growth for the foreseeable future. And we'll quantify it for you as we start to move up and get some of these wins.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Alliance Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDougHarned: Good morning. Thank you. If I think back to Chris to what L3 looked like not that long ago and you had all of more than 80 or so businesses with overlapping overhead functions and the sense of need to rationalize the supply chains and facilities. And if we roll forward where does--where do things stand today in terms of addressing a lot of the opportunities and costs that you had before because I'm just -- you continue to find new cost synergy. So I'm trying to figure out what the pathway looks like in terms of the things you've gotten done, the things that are still to go here and where you can potentially be?\nChrisKubasik: Yes, no, that's a great question, Doug. And I say we made a really good progress in the last 13 months but a lot of the progress we made was a result of starting early even the pre-merger. I'd say we're ahead of schedule on the synergies that we talked about, but everything that we've looked at shows continued margin upside and cost take off opportunities well beyond the initial three-year period. The facility consolidations are ongoing. Those will take the most time as you would expect. I think we've made great progress on the supply chain and that's just something we're going to continue to work on year after year. And also not only on the value capture but improving the resiliency given some of the recent challenges in the COVID environment. So if this were a baseball game we're probably in the second or third inning as I see it holistically. And really hitting the ground running on day one. The benefits and the HR and all those initiatives were done on the first cycle which was pretty impressive. So I think there's a lot more to go and we see this as part of our culture of operating excellence and it's just going to go year after year and I think there's a lot more to go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. \nSheilaKahyaoglu: Hi. Good morning, everyone and thank you. Bill, I think you mentioned six businesses with high working capital and you quantified the opportunity which is quite big at $500 million, I'm guessing the size of these businesses might be fairly large, but is there anything structurally different about them and how do we think about that working capital drive down contributing to intermediate results?\nBillBrown: No. There's nothing structurally different about them. They -- what's happening is we're getting into a lot of detail what's driving the working capital to be where it happens to be. And as I mentioned a lot of it is inventory, sometimes inventory is north of 100 days and it's about just prudent management, improving forecasting, improving the performance with suppliers because a lack of confidence in when a supplier is going to deliver a component drives management to increase buffer stock. It's managing better the development of new product so that you're leveraging components that exist across other products. So you reduce sort of both SKUs as well as the parts that go into the SKU. So it's really across all of those fundamental pieces, Chris and I and Jay have a weekly evidence just right next to our integration meeting is the focus on working capital. We've been doing this since day one. We've got dedicated teams focused on this, is driven by the general managers themselves. The teams are incentivized to improve cash. We incentivize and drive working capital. So we expect to make a big achievement in those six businesses but the reality is we have 19 different sectors all of which have opportunities to improve working capital and we're going after every single one of them. That's what gives us confidence of taking the 55 to below 50 and hitting 40 over the next couple of years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. \nRichardSafran: Hi. Good morning, everybody. I hope everybody's well. So Bill and Chris, I thought I had another question on your revenue synergies. I thought you might try to explain the driver of the revenue synergies. And if they continue why the potential is north of $5 billion. And why they've come so much earlier than expected? To me Pentagon's giving awards to non-traditional players in major platform markets, you have space with launchers. And you recently with Maritime, so is that the driver here, why you stand to benefit? Is the Pentagon looking for more competitors? And bringing in non-traditional players? And I guess is there room now for moving LHX to the next level as a sixth prime?\nBillBrown: I think the DoD is looking for more competition, more company suppliers that can bring unique mission solutions that can simplify what they're doing bring additional capabilities it\u2019s driven through technology investment. I think what we've proven is the ability to a; invest the technology dollars. And then find ways of delivering new capability from those investments. So I think that's clearly the direction that the DoD happens to be moving into, but I think we have just a great opportunity across our portfolio. We've had from day one, people getting together in classified spaces and open spaces sharing ideas. And when you have a good sense of what the mission need is, and you put technologists in a room. To try to look at what we can do differently. There are just lots of great opportunities that, that come from the capabilities that being brought by this new entity. So, we're still early days. This is only one year and it's moving faster than we had expected. There's been a lot of resonance with the customer as you could see by the winds we've had so far. We've got to follow through; we've got to win some of the down selects, move some of the studies that Chris mentioned here with DARPA into actual programs of record but that happen over time with continued focus and investment. And if anything that the opportunity said is getting bigger than smaller. A lot of it's coming in the classified side as well. I mean keep in mind too in the classified domain a lot of these things are relatively stovepipe and the larger companies have a broader view across multiple different programs. So what we're now doing is getting more visibility across multiple different types of programs, classified programs and we're bringing different mission solutions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed with your question.\nGeorgeShapiro: Yes, good morning. This is probably for Jay. I was curious as to how much incremental cash you got from the change in progress payments? I noticed that accounts payable were down $328 million. So, you obviously gave some of that back at the same time receivables, inventories and contract assets were down $447 million. So maybe just expand on that. And then what you would expect it to be for the year and is that a potential increment to the cash flow guidance that you have? Thanks.\nJayMalave: Okay, George. So I'll just go to the quarter and then the year. In the quarter the progress payment benefits were in the range of $100 million. And that was pretty much flowed down through to the suppliers. Separate from that we did have customer payment accelerations that also we benefited from in the quarter, you're in the range of say $150million or so. The flow through of that to the full year is really dependent on what the customers do. If the customers continue to on that type of prepayment schedule on the non-progress payment type of a payment schedule. Then we would see a potential upside in the year if it's, if not and then they go back we'll probably see a snap back and it really would just be pulling into the second quarter. So, it could be upside, we have to kind of just monitor the customer behavior over the back half for the year as far as these accelerated payments. I mean if the progress payments right now we're expecting those will continue but those could shift as well but as I just mentioned that's been basically flowed down to the suppliers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nPeterArment: Yes, good morning Bill, Chris, Jay. Bill I want to circle back on the budget kind of topic. We get a lot from investors about maybe L3Harris as exposure to kind of the OEM, O&M side of the budget? And I think it's reasonably high. How should we think about that part of the budget if that, if the overall budget starts to compress how that impacts you? I know there's a lot of ISR missions and activities that flow through there but maybe just some color on how we should think about that?\nBillBrown: Well, it's sound -- I think we size it in the 40 percentage range of our of our business, it\u2019s O&M funded. I think this year the DoD is under running the spending on O&M, so it does create actually some additional opportunities for O&M dollars and you mentioned exactly right some of that does fund some of the ISR missions that we happen to have here. So we think we're well positioned on that. I don't think it's a major concern as we go into 2021. I don't know Chris or Jay if you have any thought on that but--\nChrisKubasik: I think it's just good diversity and various sources and colors of money. I think is actually strength. So yes I echo what Bill says I think we're in good shape.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nDavidStrauss: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Bill, I want to follow-up you mentioned E3, if you could maybe talk about what kind of organic margin upside you've seen so far from E3, how much further you think it can go? And then on the synergy side, you said a bunch of times there's upside to $300 million any sort of quantification of how much upside there could be beyond that? Thanks.\nBillBrown: So David, look, we're making really good progress on E3 in fact at L3, Chris instituted a program called L365. We had our own program here at Harris HBX the combination of that I think has yielded a process internal process that's been driven deep into the organization. We typically would expect something like 2% to 3% net of inflation, net of giving back to the customer as well of costs coming out and we're seeing E3 in that range over the course of the year is getting a little bit better. I think we would sustain that in 2021 and 2022. So it sizes it a bit. As we get beyond the calendar 2022 time period and integration starts to wind down in terms of that focus process the drive to achieving cost savings will continue. It all merges into what we now call E3. So we do expect to hit $300 million net in 2021. We do see opportunities beyond that some of the -- I think that Chris mentioned a minute ago about facility rationalization. They do take a bit longer. They won't be fully completed in 2021. So we'd see a little bit of step up in beyond 2021 on just this consolidation of the facility. So we can't really size it today as we get further down the path, we'll continue to update investors on this, but as you think about where we've been over the last six months we started out the year guiding to about $115 million net. We went to $165 million now we are at $185 million in an environment that's very uncertain with the COVID pandemic. So we continue to make great progress here, great progress on E3 and all of this is going to drive us north of 18% margins next year with some upside beyond that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question.\nPeteSkibitski: Yes. Good morning, guys. Hey just on the really strong second quarter margin rate at IMS was there any one-off benefit in there and it looks like guidance is assuming kind of a lower rate sequentially in the second half of the year. Jay kind of touched on a little bit but any color that you could add there?\nJayMalave: Sure, Pete. It's really strong synergy drop through over 200 basis points. They do have a benefit of pension running through because that's a predominantly legacy l3 business, but they also had strong productivity E3 productivity dropping through which pretty much offset any mixed headwinds. And a little bit slower on R&D there and as I mentioned we expect R&D to step up in the back half of the year. For the full year, they're just --they're doing well. We originally 13.5%, it does step down as I said for the R&D as well as a little bit of a mix as we induct some aircraft, but bottom line there you're going to see some solid margins around 14.5% for the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.\nMichaelCiarmoli: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to stay on that R&D looking at the second half margins they obviously come down a bit, you talked about that COVID placeholder and I think you called that out maybe as a contingency in the earnings bridge. So maybe that's $10 million or so, but how big -- how do we think about the R&D step up? and I guess I'm thinking about it too in the context you're talking about of 30% IRAD but it sounds like cutting 30% that IRAD but it sounds like some of that's just going to be reinvested. Is that the right way to think about sort of the reprioritizing of the IRAD and kind of funneling it back into higher areas of opportunity?\nJayMalave: Yes. A lot of the reprioritization occurred as part of our planning process for the year. We're going to step up around 3.5% to about 3.7% in the back half of the year and what we're talking about is as part of the checkpoint process is really just a process for defining prioritizing those projects. There might be some timing differences here and there and we continue to monitor them as part of that process. But there's not been any type of effort to actually reduce R&D spends as we dealt with some of the headwinds with COVID that's really been more other expense type of discretionary spends items that we've been dealing with. And so our goal has been to hold our R&D and protect the investment and for all the items and revenue synergies that the Bill referenced before.\nChrisKubasik: I'll just chime in with a 1.19 book-to-bill and IMS specifically. A lot of these as you know start out as more developmental programs and then over the course of the life of the program you get into low rate production and ultimately production of the margins increase. So a little bit of the second half pressure is coming from some of these recent maritime wins which are good margins but dilutive in the near term but we'll ramp up as we continue to deliver on them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRobertSpingarn: Hi. Good morning, everybody. I wondered if we could disaggregate the space group, space and airborne a little bit just the primes are having such strong growth there. And I'm wondering if you're seeing a higher growth in space than airborne if you could talk about that a little bit. And then if longer term on the space side, you think you can potentially outgrow the market just given the share gain opportunities if you have in front of you.\nBillBrown: Yes. So, we feel very encouraged by the space business as a whole. Just in the quarter, we had a couple of programs that are transitioning and just the year-over-year comp was particularly difficult in the second quarter last year in 2019 Q2 which as you recall was Q4, the last fiscal quarter of Harris. We had sort of 18%-19% growth in that space segment. So it was quite strong and the comp was kind of difficult just on a year-over-year basis. So, a little bit of impact on just calendarization pretty good book-to-bill in the first half of the year just over one. We were very confident about that business, very strong pipeline of opportunities coming at us in space as we transition from an exquisite provider to end-to-end responsive mission solutions prime, Chris talked about that in his remarks that's both ground -- both space capability and ground support for space capability. The pipeline in those businesses is quite large. It's about $10 billion. We have about a $1 billion of proposals outstanding that are pending awards. So, as we look at this, we expect towards the back end of this year, we'll see some recovery but overall through the technology investments we've had, some of the revenue synergy opportunities that'll come through in the space domain, we feel very good about the opportunities in space. So that space segment also has airborne and airborne has been quite strong for us. That's a lot of the F-35 growth; it's modernization, it's production, it's some sustainment growth there as well. So, we see in our classified part of that space business is growing quite well. So look, we feel very confident about space, it'll come back towards the back end of the year and be a driver getting into 2021.\nChrisKubasik: Hey, Robert, I'll just chime in, one of the things that were very exciting about this merger was space and of course pre-merger, you couldn't look at it due to clearances but once we got all the clearances set up. And I got into the program several months back. I got to say I'm even more impressed now than what I thought was suspected that we had. So I think we're in good shape. We just got to continue to win and perform and I think there's some long-term growth here that's going to be pretty impressive.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMylesWalton: Thanks. Good morning. So, I wanted to ask other guys in the space and people in the space have size the R&D tax amortization in 2022. I'm curious if you can do the same. And then secondarily on the segments, I know that the pension adjustment being made there was a [$98.9] million in the quarter. Bill, is there any assumption about how much pension helps or hurts that you have to absorb going forward over the next couple of years? And your comment about 18% margin next year and beyond.\nBillBrown: So, on taxes the impact in 2022 is north of $500 million if the law stays as it is. As you know, others as well as us believe that wasn't necessarily, the intent of the legislation to penalize R&D investment and so that's something obviously we're continuing to work, but just to answer your question specifically. It will be north of $500 million. On pension, if you look at gross pension this year it's about $300 million of benefit; year-over- year it is about $60 million. There's a $100 million in the FAS pension benefit that's offset by about $50 million of lower cash recovery and so net-net you're talking about $50 million - $60 million. Right now, we're not expecting any significant changes in pension benefits next year. If we were to strike it right now would be generally in line with that. I mean a little bit worse obviously on the returns but that gets amortized. So right now we're pretty much holding in line there for what I told you about $300 million FAS and $60 million of cash.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nJonRaviv: Thank you very much for squeezing me in here. So, when you're talking, Bill and Chris, you're talking about transition obviously to an operating company while the industry itself has been in some transition. We know what the NDS wants for capabilities. Can you talk about how it's acquired? How those things are changing like investment requirements, business models, partnerships, leveraging commercial. You've got a big prime out there with new leadership talking about new ways of doing business like 5G, some of it sounds like stuff that you do. So, you can just expand on what the next generation of defense industry you think looks like here?\nBillBrown: Well, Jon, I'll start and maybe Chris can jump in here. But the way I look at this without commenting on what other players in the space happen to be doing. We're very unique in a sense that we've got this opportunity that can only be created by this significant transformation driven by a merger. It's a seminal event allows us to drive a clean sheet and take a fresh approach about how you drive connectivity, cooperation, collaboration across the enterprise and that's what we talk about when we drive towards an operating company is from a technology perspective making sure all of the pieces are connected across the enterprise. We believe success in the future is going to come from driving our business as operating entities not as disconnected pieces of an [indiscernible] organization like a holding company would have. So, we have an opportunity to drive that as part of the DNA that's being created in the organization that we're building. We're not trying to start from an existing large position, but we've got good momentum that's built here and we feel pretty good about our ability to compete and win based on that particular model. \nChrisKubasik: And I'll just say from the customer perspective. And I will throw out the customers have been great here during the pandemic. I mean Bill and I have had unfettered access to them and there's been a lot of creativity accepting a lot of our products using video and virtual means and inspecting the products. But the customer talks a lot about speed and they have rapid capability offices. They're using OTAs as an example. And I think we've been pretty good in responding and quick turns and winning some of these new business opportunities, several of which are revenue synergies. And again I think the mission systems are becoming more and more important and the customers are looking at maybe procuring those directly from companies like us and there are several initiatives in that regard ABMS and others. So, I think we're well positioned and we can adjust to the customer as they change their buying patterns. And if there's new business models, I think we're more than capable to support that so.\nBillBrown: And certainly there's not -- we're not beholden to a platform. There's not a loss risk -- risk of loss of revenue from moving from proprietary to open systems. We're building the organization from the start with a focus on open systems architecture, which we believe is an opportunity for us and certainly what we're here to do.  So, I want to thank everybody for joining the call today. And I'd like to close by again thanking our employees as well as the leadership team for their hard work, for their dedication as we wrap up our first year as L3Harris. And for continuing meeting customer commitments during these very challenging times. So, thank you to everyone and be safe. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Chris Kubasik",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Bill and good morning, everyone. I'd like to highlight the quarterly segment results starting on slide 6. Integrated Mission Systems increased revenue 7% from growth in our Electro Optical and Maritime Businesses with ISR relatively flat in the quarter, but expected to pick up in the back half of the year. Operating income was up 38% and margin expanded 370 basis points to 16.8% from integration benefits, operational excellence and cost management. Order momentum at IMS was broad-based with a funded book- to-bill above 1.0 in each business resulting in an overall segment book-to-bill of 1.19 for the quarter and 1.12 since the merger. Our highlight in recent months has been the traction we've seen in our maritime business. In the quarter, we received an order from a classified customer for an unmanned surface vehicle. And just this month, we were selected as the prime contractor for the medium unmanned surface vehicle for the U.S navy. We're also in the process of finalizing our position on the U.S navy's frigate program as a system integrator this initial 10-ship contract has a potential value of over $300 million. So clearly, we're seeing positive momentum in this business. On slide 7, Space and Airborne Systems revenue increased 4% in the quarter. Growth in Avionics from the production and modernization ramp of the F-35 and increased classified work at Intel and cyber were partially offset by program transition timing and a tough compare in the space business. Segment operating income was up 3% and margin contracted 20 basis points to 18.8% as operational excellence and integration benefits were offset by program mix from increased developmental work and investments in earlier stage technologies. Overall funded book-to-bill was 0.94 for the quarter and just below 1 since the merger, with particular strength in space, which delivered a book-to-bill over 1.0 in the quarter. As a reminder, in our space business, we are transitioning from a legacy exquisite payload provider to a full end-to-end systems provider for responsive satellite and ground systems. A recent launch for the U.S Air Force demonstrated this capability. We designed, developed and built satellites within a couple years and are now providing the tasking and the command and control for these on-orbit spacecraft. This speed to market is a significant differentiator compared to legacy systems that take nearly a decade to become operational. As war fighting capabilities accelerate in the space domain, we are well positioned to participate and capture new business and have a strong pipeline that exceeds $10 billion to support growth in the medium and long term. On slide 8, Communication Systems revenue was up 2.5% for the quarter as DoD tactical and integrated vision systems benefited from modernization demand, both were up double digits. This strength was partially offset by international tactical radio sales timing and headwinds at our public safety business both of which were down in the mid-teens consistent with prior expectations. Segment operating income was up 11% and margin expanded 190 basis points to 23.9% from integration benefits and cost management. Turning to orders, DoD tactical modernization momentum continued with a $95 million award for an additional low rate production contract on the US army's HMS Manpack. After completion of the operational testing early next year, we anticipate a full rate production award against the previously announced IDIQ of nearly $13 billion. This will support continued revenue growth. Lastly on slide 9, Aviation Systems organic revenue decreased 7% in the quarter with commercial aviation down about 50% due to the pandemic in line with our expectations. This headwind was partially offset by continued growth within the classified areas at defense aviation products, which was up in the mid-teens. Operating income was down 8% primarily due to the impact of divestitures, but would have grown 4% otherwise. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 12.5% from operational efficiencies, integration benefits and cost actions, partially offset by COVID related headwinds. Orders significantly outpaced sales leading to a funded segment book-to-bill of 1.26 for the quarter and 1.13 since the merger. We saw considerable traction on the defense side for airborne radars, ground vehicle systems and training solutions, as well as within the classified arena. One of the key wins in the quarter was the $900 million single award IDIQ to develop and manage simulator requirements and standards across the Air Force's training portfolio. This solution will leverage open systems architecture and set common standards for the Air Force and aligns with the DoD move towards multi-domain operations and ties to the program direction of JAB C2. It will also position us well for future military training offerings. So before handing it over to Jay, I'd like to echo Bill's comments and thank our employees for their dedication, focus and hard work during the pandemic. We'll continue to prioritize your health and safety as we move forward. With that over to you Jay. Yes, maybe I'll just add a little bit, Rob. We talked a lot about leveraging the scale of the enterprise and I think in this industry scale matters and you look at this new company with close to $700 million of R&D that positions us well for these new markets and NextGen opportunities. So we're starting with the clean sheet. I believe we're pretty agile and responsive. The national defense strategy talks about disaggregation. Bill mentioned autonomy and some of the capabilities we have there fit nicely with these large platforms and then the ability to connect them. And you look at our ability to attract and hire college grads and others, there's a lot of excitement with this new company. People see that we're growing 8% in the government business and I think we're ahead of schedule and going better than I would have expected after 13-months. And I'll just chime in Carter, I mean; this is what we've been talking about for almost a year and internally and externally. This is about optimizing the enterprise the greater good of L3Harris versus optimizing the divisions and this is part of the transition from more of a holding company to an operating company. And when we look at things holistically from the top down, we're able to prioritize those to get the greater growth and the greater returns. Same process applies to CapEx and everything else that Bill, Jay and I look at on a regular basis. So that's the origin of the 30% that Bill referenced. Yes, no. I'll sign up to at least $100 million a year and would you say 10 years from now, no, it's as Bill said it's going better than we expected. And we have a very strict definition of what we're calling revenue synergy. These are bids that neither company would have submitted had we not merged together. So we're getting the momentum, a lot of these are the initial wins some from DARPA, some from rapid capability office and then we got a win from four to two to one but we like the momentum. And I would expect that this will contribute to our top line growth for the foreseeable future. And we'll quantify it for you as we start to move up and get some of these wins. Yes, no, that's a great question, Doug. And I say we made a really good progress in the last 13 months but a lot of the progress we made was a result of starting early even the pre-merger. I'd say we're ahead of schedule on the synergies that we talked about, but everything that we've looked at shows continued margin upside and cost take off opportunities well beyond the initial three-year period. The facility consolidations are ongoing. Those will take the most time as you would expect. I think we've made great progress on the supply chain and that's just something we're going to continue to work on year after year. And also not only on the value capture but improving the resiliency given some of the recent challenges in the COVID environment. So if this were a baseball game we're probably in the second or third inning as I see it holistically. And really hitting the ground running on day one. The benefits and the HR and all those initiatives were done on the first cycle which was pretty impressive. So I think there's a lot more to go and we see this as part of our culture of operating excellence and it's just going to go year after year and I think there's a lot more to go. I think it's just good diversity and various sources and colors of money. I think is actually strength. So yes I echo what Bill says I think we're in good shape. I'll just chime in with a 1.19 book-to-bill and IMS specifically. A lot of these as you know start out as more developmental programs and then over the course of the life of the program you get into low rate production and ultimately production of the margins increase. So a little bit of the second half pressure is coming from some of these recent maritime wins which are good margins but dilutive in the near term but we'll ramp up as we continue to deliver on them. Hey, Robert, I'll just chime in, one of the things that were very exciting about this merger was space and of course pre-merger, you couldn't look at it due to clearances but once we got all the clearances set up. And I got into the program several months back. I got to say I'm even more impressed now than what I thought was suspected that we had. So I think we're in good shape. We just got to continue to win and perform and I think there's some long-term growth here that's going to be pretty impressive. And I'll just say from the customer perspective. And I will throw out the customers have been great here during the pandemic. I mean Bill and I have had unfettered access to them and there's been a lot of creativity accepting a lot of our products using video and virtual means and inspecting the products. But the customer talks a lot about speed and they have rapid capability offices. They're using OTAs as an example.

So, I think we're well positioned and we can adjust to the customer as they change their buying patterns. And if there's new business models, I think we're more than capable to support that so."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Jay Malave",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with a recap of second quarter results then provide an update on the impact of COVID and then wrap up with guidance. In the quarter, organic revenue was up nearly 2.5% as 8% growth in our US government business more than offset the commercial decline. EBIT increased 9% on 18.2% margins resulting in EPS growth of 13% or 0.32 as shown on slide 10. Of this growth $0.22 came from synergies, $0.15 from operations including cost management and $0.13 from share count, pension and other items including divestitures, partially offset by pandemic related headwinds of $0.18 mainly from our commercial businesses. Free cash flow for the quarter was $785 million and we ended the period with 55 working capital days or two days better sequentially after adjusting for divestitures and purchase accounting adjustments, versus the prior year and our expectations we benefited from accelerating customer collections and ongoing inventory management, while continuing to support our suppliers. Margins in the quarter came in at 18.2% or 150 basis points higher than last year and ahead of our internal views. Most of the expansion or 140 basis points came from the $60 million synergies drop through. We also saw benefits from our cost management efforts and tailwinds from reduced expenses such as for travel and trade shows. Along with operational efficiencies which more than offset 60 basis points of COVID headwind. While some of the expense tailwinds are temporary, our margin performance highlights the portfolio's resiliency during a tough environment and our future earnings potential. Next let's turn to slide 11 for details on the guidance outlook. Organic revenue is unchanged at up 3% to 5% % with top line trending as expected. And overall COVID impacts still sized within our prior range. For our core US government business representing about of 75% sales, we expect the 8% first half growth to carry over to the back half as well. And for our commercial aerospace businesses, which were down about 50% in the quarter, it's generally tracking to our previous forecast for the year and in line with broader industry forecasts. In public safety, the business was down in the mid-teens in the quarter and we now expect that business to decline around 15% from 10% previously, reflecting the slow pace of new awards. On international, we're holding our flattest view for the year based on our second half visibility with upside opportunity in ISR. So overall relatively minor changes with a clear line of sight to our sales outlook, which is supported by a funded book-to-bill of 1.1 in the first half. Shifting the margins. We've increased our outlook to 17.5% plus with the plus indicating potential upside of 10 to 20 basis points versus the prior guidance of 17.5%. Due to performance to date. cost synergies, E3 progress and expense management. Margins step back in the second half versus the second quarter due to higher R&D investment as well as a placeholder for higher COVID related mitigation costs or disruptions, but still continued margin expansion progress on the full year of nearly 100 basis points. On EPS, we're holding the full year guidance range of $11.15 to $11.55 with the contingency at the midpoint from the margin up side to account for the uncertain backdrop amid to pandemic's progression. On capital allocation, we're in a strong cash position and should remain so after completing our committed repurchases with divesture proceeds here in the third quarter. Beyond that we'll continue to monitor market conditions for deployment opportunities such as capital returns and employee pension plan contributions. Moving to free cash flow, our guide of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion remains intact with similar upward pressure from earnings upside, working capital traction and lighter CapEx. Finally and briefly on the segment outlook. We've maintained our guidance for all line items but for margins at IMS, where we see likely upside. The improvement is coming from synergy drop through and operational excellence via E3 productivity. Both year-to-date and going forward. So a great example of the merger benefits. So to put it all together, a solid growth outlook supported by our year-to-date performance and forward visibility. With an upside bias assuming a stabilizing environment. And with that I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. Okay, George. So I'll just go to the quarter and then the year. In the quarter the progress payment benefits were in the range of $100 million. And that was pretty much flowed down through to the suppliers. Separate from that we did have customer payment accelerations that also we benefited from in the quarter, you're in the range of say $150million or so. The flow through of that to the full year is really dependent on what the customers do. If the customers continue to on that type of prepayment schedule on the non-progress payment type of a payment schedule. Then we would see a potential upside in the year if it's, if not and then they go back we'll probably see a snap back and it really would just be pulling into the second quarter. So, it could be upside, we have to kind of just monitor the customer behavior over the back half for the year as far as these accelerated payments. I mean if the progress payments right now we're expecting those will continue but those could shift as well but as I just mentioned that's been basically flowed down to the suppliers. Sure, Pete. It's really strong synergy drop through over 200 basis points. They do have a benefit of pension running through because that's a predominantly legacy l3 business, but they also had strong productivity E3 productivity dropping through which pretty much offset any mixed headwinds. And a little bit slower on R&D there and as I mentioned we expect R&D to step up in the back half of the year. For the full year, they're just --they're doing well. We originally 13.5%, it does step down as I said for the R&D as well as a little bit of a mix as we induct some aircraft, but bottom line there you're going to see some solid margins around 14.5% for the year. Yes. A lot of the reprioritization occurred as part of our planning process for the year. We're going to step up around 3.5% to about 3.7% in the back half of the year and what we're talking about is as part of the checkpoint process is really just a process for defining prioritizing those projects. There might be some timing differences here and there and we continue to monitor them as part of that process. But there's not been any type of effort to actually reduce R&D spends as we dealt with some of the headwinds with COVID that's really been more other expense type of discretionary spends items that we've been dealing with. And so our goal has been to hold our R&D and protect the investment and for all the items and revenue synergies that the Bill referenced before."

            "name": "Bill Brown",
            "content": "Okay. Well, thank you, Rajeev and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking L3Harris employees for their hard work and dedication of over the last several months. The pandemic has challenged us all to find new ways of working effectively. And our team has responded well to ensure we continue to meet the mission critical needs of our customers even as the virus spreads across southern states, where we have a large presence. And as the environment evolves, the health and safety of our employees will remain our top priority. All of our facilities are up and running and adhering to well-established protocols such as daily health screenings, face coverings, social distancing and adjusted work schedules. Our work from home policy remains in place for about half our workforce. And we are prepared to operate under these conditions over the coming quarters. We continue to pay close attention to our supply base and monitor our risk position daily and we've successfully implemented mitigation plans where needed, including developing alternative sourcing, providing on-site assistance and working with local authorities to secure closure exemptions. In addition, we accelerated nearly $250 million in supplier payments within the quarter and we plan to continue that support through year end. We're also doing our fair share to support our communities' health care workers and first responders through the pandemic. And we continue to hire aggressively to meet our growth needs, adding about 3,000# employees through June and bringing on board our largest cohort of interns and new college grads ever. Chris and Jay will walk through the details in a minute but as you saw earlier today we reported second quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.83, up a solid 13% against a tough backdrop. Company margins increased 150 basis points to 18.2% and adjusted free cash flow was $785 million, all above expectations. Reported revenue was flat but adjusted for divestitures was up about 2.5% as strong 8% growth in our core U.S. government-related businesses more than offset a modest decline on the international side and a 35% drop in our small commercial businesses, consistent with what we anticipated. Total company funded book-to-bill was 1.09 with funded backlog growing about 5% since the beginning of the year when adjusted for divestitures. Our strategic priorities have remained the same since we closed on the merger a year ago. And we're proud that our nearly 50,000 employees quickly aligned as one operating company. And we're pleased with how well the team is executing and avoiding operational missteps despite the many moving parts. Integration continues to progress well with net synergy savings of $60 million in the quarter and $115 million year-to-date. We have not seen a slowdown in activity due to COVID and now believe we can deliver $185 million in net savings this year, up $20 million from prior estimate, largely due to a steady ramp in savings from the supply chain, shared services and benefits. Our integration roadmap is very methodical and rigorous with a weekly cadence of top-down reviews and we continue to expect to achieve $300 million in cumulative net savings in calendar 2021, one year ahead of original plan. We're making good progress and driving a culture of operational excellence deep into the company and through the quarter, we continue to hold training sessions and conduct lean assessments, quality clinics and value engineering events despite the inability to travel. As we've said before, e3savings are additive to synergies and we're a key part of the margin expansion we achieved in the quarter and year-to-date. But more importantly are essential to expanding margins beyond the integration window. Investments in technology and innovation remain at the top of our agenda and are key to long-term revenue growth. Since the closing, we fully implemented a rigorous stage gate process called Checkpoint and cut 30% of IRAD projects to sharpen our focus on key strategic themes around spectrum superiority, actionable intelligence and war fighter effectiveness, while positioning for the shift to an integrated networked battlefield. We are investing heavily in multi-function, software-defined, open architecture systems that allow us to deliver mission solutions independent of the platform. These investments are evident and are increasing traction on revenue synergies; we've now been down selected on 13 out of 23 proposals and continued to build on our multi-billion pipeline. While we're still in the early innings, the collaboration we're seeing across segments is really impressive with the process to identify new revenue synergy opportunities nearly self-sustaining. On portfolio reshaping, we are set to close today on the divestiture of EOTech, a small consumer-facing business bringing total transactions to date to four with proceeds exceeding $1 billion. We're now about one-third of the way toward our bottoms-up estimate of divesting 8% to 10% of revenue with more progress expected in the coming quarters as we increase our focus on businesses where we're best positioned to win. And on maximizing cash generation, we delivered $785 million of free cash flow in the quarter and about $2.7 billion on a LTM basis, growth of over 20% on a per share basis. Our strong performance along with divestiture proceeds drove a cash balance of $2 billion at quarter end and supports our prior commitment to return capital to shareholders in the third quarter. Longer term, we see a clear path to achieving $3 billion free cash flow in calendar 2022, driven in part by continued improvement in working capital. In the quarter, we achieved another two day sequential improvement with solid momentum toward a calendar 2022 goal of sub 50-days from 68 at merger close adjusted for divestitures and accounting items. Slide 4 illustrates the opportunity ahead of us. 10 businesses account for about 75% of our working capital, six of which have more than 75 days on hand, driving those six the current company average of 55 days would generate nearly $0.5 billion of cash flow with the largest opportunity tied to lower inventory. Shorter cycle times, better forecasting, product rationalization and part commonization, vendor managed inventory and improved supplier delivery performance. The levers are clear. We've done it before and the team is focused and motivated to get it done. Finally, we're all watching carefully the progress towards a 2021 defense budget and signals from Congress, the Biden campaign and the Trump administration on the budget trajectory in 2022 and beyond. We're encouraged by the bipartisan support in advancing the fiscal 2021 National Defense Authorization Act through the house and senate and we believe that the heightened threat environment will drive the trajectory of U.S military spending regardless of the election. And while we're conscious of the risks surrounding elevated deficits, we believe our technological capabilities and opportunity set position as well over the coming years. Recent house and senate marks support this as we saw ongoing strength in areas like tactical radio, aircraft ISR, F-35 and space and classified budgets are also set to be well supported. So between budget positioning, revenue synergies, margin expansion potential and shareholder friendly capital deployment, we remain confident in our ability to sustain double-digit earnings and free cash flow growth per share in the medium term. And with that I'll now turn it over to Chris Kubasik to discuss segment results. Chris? Yes. So Seth thanks for the question. So between now and 2022 time frame mid single digit plus type of revenue growth that we expect because we're seeing good visibility in the 2021 budget, which we think is going to get passed sometime in the next six months or so. Our programs are very well supported there. A lot of unspent dollars from prior years, good opportunities on revenue synergies, growth opportunities international. So we see the top line continue to improve, margins coming up, we're doing very well in margin progression this year. Jay just talked about some of the upside drivers here in calendar 2020 we see continued momentum on margins over the next couple of years. It's certainly not going to end as we get to 2020. There's going to be opportunities even certainly beyond that. Working capital is a driver, we've made great progress down 13 days since the close to 55. We see getting to about 50 days or below 50 by the time we get calendar 2022. But that way we look at this from a bottom up perspective, Harris was at 41. We can see our ability getting down into those 40-41 days. So even as we had 50 days in 2022 an extra 10 beyond that's about $350 million worth of cash, which has great opportunity to deploy it. In the near term certainly next year or so towards share buyback that will reduce our share count. So overall you put all those pieces together, we continue to see double-digit growth in free cash per share. Well, I mean I'll start and I'll let maybe Chris jump in here, Rob. So that's -- it's a great question, look, I think part of the reason why almost two years ago now Chris and I contemplating putting the company together was really to build a more scaled mission solutions, priming Chris talked a lot about becoming a sixth prime. When we sit there in fact when we talked about our merger back in October of 2018, we talked about our presence connecting across all domains a CP or ISR powerhouse company mission solutions prime company. And you can see based on the progression we've seen to-date clearly moving in that direction. Certainly as the DoD moves towards connecting all of their platforms, all sensors, all shooters across all domains. I see us be really being in the sweet spot of that. We've won 7 IDIQs on ABMS. There's a lot of players on the team, but I think it's testament to the capability that this organization has overall in spectrum superiority, spectrum dominance across what we do in electronic warfare, waveforms, communications, ISR, all those pieces come together to help realize that vision of where the DoD needs to move to in order to fight the next fight. You can see really across all domains. The progress in space, the progress in unmanned both airborne and maritime. So we're really I think realizing that vision and I think we're a much more resilient organization today we would have been several years ago with a tremendous opportunity to gain share in a market that may flatten or come down over time. So I think we're just a fundamentally different position today we were a number of years ago. I don't know, if you want to add, Chris. Hey, Carter. It's a great question and it really I'm glad you asked it because I think it's a fundamental part of the value creation story that we have in front of us. We've been talking about this for a couple of years of taking, as Chris just mentioned $700 million worth of IRAD that previously was distributed very deeply and broadly across the company not centrally coordinated, no clear business rationale across the individual investments and through the work that CTO Ross has done here to really get at and categorize where all that money is going. We looked at it; we saw 30% of the projects that were -- didn't have a business case or were overlapping were duplicates. And we've provided two investors some examples of that, so allows us to focus that firepower that's pretty potent on a smaller set of opportunities really around the areas around multi-function, open systems architecture, software-defined everything that really is the heart of what we're trying to do in spectrum superiority, sensing solutions, delivering actionable intelligence. That's where we're really focused and as I think about this that's -- that is going to enable us to continue to invest in these new opportunities that we're seeing coming through in revenue synergies. We've won quite a few here. They're small today in terms of revenue impact. They'll grow over time but the pipeline is large, is getting bigger and really positions us and I think in a fundamentally different way. So when you think about value creation, a potential into the future for a technology company we call L3Harris, this is fundamental to the value creation story. Yes. So, Noah, look in Q3, we will use the proceeds we received from the sale of SDS to Leidos, was $1 billion we closed that out in Q2. We'll deploy that back to owners as we've always said we would in Q3 we sold an asset and we're buying back an asset, happy to be our stock. As we look to the back end of the year with a $1.3 billion, 3 billion four-ish in free cash generation in the second half. We'll end the year with a pretty strong balance of cash in the [one seven one eight] kind of $1 billion range. So still opportunities beyond that for deployment as we've been talking a lot we see that growing $3 billion by 2022. There's no debt pay down requirements at all, we'll refinance some debt but at 1.7 going to1.5 leverage ratio. We've got, I think a good leverage basis we don't see any significant M&A on the near term horizon. So it gives a lot of opportunity to deploy that upward to $3 billion a year in free cash generation back to owners as we said we would. And that just to remind everybody is after significant investments in development internally hiring people, training people, spending investment on capital driving IRAD at close to 4% as Chris mentioned a couple of minutes ago significant investments inside the company even with that gives us an opportunity to deploy that cash effectively with shareholders. Yes. So again we won 13, it's in the tens of millions of dollars and it's actually growing it's -- we're seeing good traction there. You'll see it a little bit in the 2020 results will start to grow in 2021, little bit beyond that. The pipeline itself is north of $5 billion and it's growing every time we meet with the team. And it's pretty substantial. The opportunities that we want are in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion of lifetime revenue. So I would expect I don't commit Chris and Jay to something here, so maybe I'll let Chris jump in here but I would expect that it'll be something growing north of $100 million a year, but Chris maybe you could add. No. There's nothing structurally different about them. They -- what's happening is we're getting into a lot of detail what's driving the working capital to be where it happens to be. And as I mentioned a lot of it is inventory, sometimes inventory is north of 100 days and it's about just prudent management, improving forecasting, improving the performance with suppliers because a lack of confidence in when a supplier is going to deliver a component drives management to increase buffer stock. It's managing better the development of new product so that you're leveraging components that exist across other products. So you reduce sort of both SKUs as well as the parts that go into the SKU. So it's really across all of those fundamental pieces, Chris and I and Jay have a weekly evidence just right next to our integration meeting is the focus on working capital. We've been doing this since day one. We've got dedicated teams focused on this, is driven by the general managers themselves. The teams are incentivized to improve cash. We incentivize and drive working capital. So we expect to make a big achievement in those six businesses but the reality is we have 19 different sectors all of which have opportunities to improve working capital and we're going after every single one of them. That's what gives us confidence of taking the 55 to below 50 and hitting 40 over the next couple of years. I think the DoD is looking for more competition, more company suppliers that can bring unique mission solutions that can simplify what they're doing bring additional capabilities it's driven through technology investment. I think what we've proven is the ability to a; invest the technology dollars. And then find ways of delivering new capability from those investments. So I think that's clearly the direction that the DoD happens to be moving into, but I think we have just a great opportunity across our portfolio. We've had from day one, people getting together in classified spaces and open spaces sharing ideas. And when you have a good sense of what the mission need is, and you put technologists in a room. To try to look at what we can do differently. There are just lots of great opportunities that, that come from the capabilities that being brought by this new entity. So, we're still early days. This is only one year and it's moving faster than we had expected. There's been a lot of resonance with the customer as you could see by the winds we've had so far. We've got to follow through; we've got to win some of the down selects, move some of the studies that Chris mentioned here with DARPA into actual programs of record but that happen over time with continued focus and investment. And if anything that the opportunity said is getting bigger than smaller. A lot of it's coming in the classified side as well. I mean keep in mind too in the classified domain a lot of these things are relatively stovepipe and the larger companies have a broader view across multiple different programs. So what we're now doing is getting more visibility across multiple different types of programs, classified programs and we're bringing different mission solutions. Well, it's sound -- I think we size it in the 40 percentage range of our of our business, it's O&M funded. I think this year the DoD is under running the spending on O&M, so it does create actually some additional opportunities for O&M dollars and you mentioned exactly right some of that does fund some of the ISR missions that we happen to have here. So we think we're well positioned on that. I don't think it's a major concern as we go into 2021. I don't know Chris or Jay if you have any thought on that but-- So David, look, we're making really good progress on E3 in fact at L3, Chris instituted a program called L365. We had our own program here at Harris HBX the combination of that I think has yielded a process internal process that's been driven deep into the organization. We typically would expect something like 2% to 3% net of inflation, net of giving back to the customer as well of costs coming out and we're seeing E3 in that range over the course of the year is getting a little bit better. I think we would sustain that in 2021 and 2022. So it sizes it a bit. As we get beyond the calendar 2022 time period and integration starts to wind down in terms of that focus process the drive to achieving cost savings will continue. It all merges into what we now call E3. So we do expect to hit $300 million net in 2021. We do see opportunities beyond that some of the -- I think that Chris mentioned a minute ago about facility rationalization. They do take a bit longer. They won't be fully completed in 2021. So we'd see a little bit of step up in beyond 2021 on just this consolidation of the facility. So we can't really size it today as we get further down the path, we'll continue to update investors on this, but as you think about where we've been over the last six months we started out the year guiding to about $115 million net. We went to $165 million now we are at $185 million in an environment that's very uncertain with the COVID pandemic. So we continue to make great progress here, great progress on E3 and all of this is going to drive us north of 18% margins next year with some upside beyond that. Yes. So, we feel very encouraged by the space business as a whole. Just in the quarter, we had a couple of programs that are transitioning and just the year-over-year comp was particularly difficult in the second quarter last year in 2019 Q2 which as you recall was Q4, the last fiscal quarter of Harris. We had sort of 18%-19% growth in that space segment. So it was quite strong and the comp was kind of difficult just on a year-over-year basis. So, a little bit of impact on just calendarization pretty good book-to-bill in the first half of the year just over one. We were very confident about that business, very strong pipeline of opportunities coming at us in space as we transition from an exquisite provider to end-to-end responsive mission solutions prime, Chris talked about that in his remarks that's both ground -- both space capability and ground support for space capability. The pipeline in those businesses is quite large. It's about $10 billion. We have about a $1 billion of proposals outstanding that are pending awards. So, as we look at this, we expect towards the back end of this year, we'll see some recovery but overall through the technology investments we've had, some of the revenue synergy opportunities that'll come through in the space domain, we feel very good about the opportunities in space. So that space segment also has airborne and airborne has been quite strong for us. That's a lot of the F-35 growth; it's modernization, it's production, it's some sustainment growth there as well. So, we see in our classified part of that space business is growing quite well. So look, we feel very confident about space, it'll come back towards the back end of the year and be a driver getting into 2021. So, on taxes the impact in 2022 is north of $500 million if the law stays as it is. As you know, others as well as us believe that wasn't necessarily, the intent of the legislation to penalize R&D investment and so that's something obviously we're continuing to work, but just to answer your question specifically. It will be north of $500 million. On pension, if you look at gross pension this year it's about $300 million of benefit; year-over- year it is about $60 million. There's a $100 million in the FAS pension benefit that's offset by about $50 million of lower cash recovery and so net-net you're talking about $50 million - $60 million. Right now, we're not expecting any significant changes in pension benefits next year. If we were to strike it right now would be generally in line with that. I mean a little bit worse obviously on the returns but that gets amortized. So right now we're pretty much holding in line there for what I told you about $300 million FAS and $60 million of cash. Well, Jon, I'll start and maybe Chris can jump in here. But the way I look at this without commenting on what other players in the space happen to be doing. We're very unique in a sense that we've got this opportunity that can only be created by this significant transformation driven by a merger. It's a seminal event allows us to drive a clean sheet and take a fresh approach about how you drive connectivity, cooperation, collaboration across the enterprise and that's what we talk about when we drive towards an operating company is from a technology perspective making sure all of the pieces are connected across the enterprise. We believe success in the future is going to come from driving our business as operating entities not as disconnected pieces of an [indiscernible] organization like a holding company would have. So, we have an opportunity to drive that as part of the DNA that's being created in the organization that we're building. We're not trying to start from an existing large position, but we've got good momentum that's built here and we feel pretty good about our ability to compete and win based on that particular model. And certainly there's not -- we're not beholden to a platform. There's not a loss risk -- risk of loss of revenue from moving from proprietary to open systems. We're building the organization from the start with a focus on open systems architecture, which we believe is an opportunity for us and certainly what we're here to do.  So, I want to thank everybody for joining the call today. And I'd like to close by again thanking our employees as well as the leadership team for their hard work, for their dedication as we wrap up our first year as L3Harris. And for continuing meeting customer commitments during these very challenging times. So, thank you to everyone and be safe. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Mr. Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you, Jess. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter calendar year 2020 earnings call. On the call with me today are Bill Brown, our CEO; Chris Kubasik, our COO; and Jay Malave, our CFO. First, a few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumption, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see the press release, the presentation and our SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website which is l3harris.com where a replay of this call will also be available. And to aid with year-over-year comparability, following the L3Harris merger, prior-year results will be on a pro forma basis as reflected in the 8-K filed yesterday. With that, Bill, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.\nWilliam Brown: Okay. Well, thank you, Rajeev and good morning everyone. As we're all aware the environment has changed considerably since our last update due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Our top priority remains the safety and well-being of our employees while continuing to deliver the mission essential products and services to our customers. And I will start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work and dedication through this crisis. While we have a resilient portfolio and customer base and we're well-positioned, we're not immune to the effects of COVID-19. Despite the solid start to the year, we're trimming our outlook for revenue and earnings per share due principally to our commercial aerospace exposure and our recently completed divestiture plus some anticipated softness in international and Public Safety and potential risks from supply chain disruption. We move quickly with cost and other actions to offset these headwinds holding earnings per share within 2% of our prior guidance while increasing our margin outlook and maintaining free cash flow. Our core U.S. government business which represents about 75% of revenue is performing well and without significant challenges. Earlier today, we reported first quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.80 up 21% on 5% revenue growth. Company margins increased 170 basis points to 17.5% and adjusted free cash flow was $533 million. Total company funded book-to-bill was 1.11 driving funded backlog up 3% versus the prior year. These results were ahead of our expectations. We're actively assessing and monitoring global developments and continue to use best practices to mitigate risks related to COVID-19. We've mandated work from home for those who can, implemented social distancing, and canceled all travel and external events. In our production facilities, we've staggered work shifts, redesigned stations and implemented stringent cleaning protocols. As of today all our facilities are up and running with limited disruptions reported to date. We continue to receive a great deal of support from our key customers the DoD, the FAA, NAS and others and a large majority of our programs and facilities as well as those of our suppliers have been deemed essential to national security. The DoD has moved quickly to adjust the terms of progress payments to drive cash into the industrial base which we have passed through to our small suppliers and started a dialogue with industry on how to size and cover COVID-19 related costs. These measures combined with potential tax deferred benefits through the CARES Act provide some risk mitigation for our company and supply chain. Looking at our credit profile, our balance sheet remains healthy and we expect to have over $3.5 billion in liquidity in the form of cash on hand and revolver availability at the end of the quarter. Jay will discuss this in some more detail. In these uncertain times, we continue to execute well on the strategic priorities that we previously outlined, which is helping us deal with the crisis at hand while at the same time delivering long-term value for our shareholders. First, we continue to make great progress on integration despite the environment. Our team delivered $55 million of net synergies in Q1 from improvements in benefits in overhead costs and we now expect to achieve $165 million of incremental net savings in 2020 up versus our previous expectation of $115 million, as we accelerate savings and manage through the pandemic. And there is no change to achieving $300 million in cumulative net savings or about $500 million gross in 2021, which as we've announced before is about one-year ahead of schedule. Second, we continue to drive a culture of operational excellence deep into the company to improve quality and productivity and expand margins. This was evident in our first quarter results where we built upon last year's performance and delivered E3 savings on top of synergies offset mix headwinds. For the year, the combination of cost synergies and E3 savings allow us to increase full year margin by 25 basis points to 17.5% at the midpoint despite the cost absorption challenge from revenue headwinds and the expenses being occurred to fight the pandemic. And in our working capital we continue on the improvement trajectory from the stub year with another two-day operational reduction since year-end and about 10 days operationally since the merger close primarily from better inventory management. We believe we have the tools and proper focus to manage in the current environment leaving the path of 50 days of working capital intact for 2020. Third is to invest in technology and innovation in anticipation of customer needs to grow revenue in the long run. And we expect to sustain our industry leading spend on R&D despite the pandemic. The team is making terrific progress in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our investments, creating room in our budget to support investment in the growing pipeline of revenue synergy opportunities. We have now submitted 41 revenue synergy proposals, up 18 from last quarter with another 3 down selects out of 8 in the first quarter, primarily related to classified work in our Space and Aviation Systems segments. To-date, we've been down selected on half of the 16 proposals awarded with orders booked in the tens of millions and a lifetime revenue potential of over $2 billion. Our fourth priority is reshaping the portfolio to focus on high margin, high growth and technology differentiated businesses. And this has not changed. So far we've announced three transactions representing about 3% of revenue that will result in about a billion dollars in proceeds. Our airport security and automation business, the largest of these announcements closed yesterday with two smaller ones closing later this month and by mid-year, neither of which have a financing contingency. We're still targeting divestitures in the range of 8% to 10% of revenue including the divestitures announced to-date. And while the timing is now more fluid, we continue to have active discussions and are committed to maximizing value. And then finally, our fifth priority is to maximize cash flow to sustainably grow free cash flow per share. We're maintaining our adjusted free cash flow guide for 2020 at $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion and remain on track to achieve $3 billion in 2022. In the quarter, we generated over $500 million in free cash flow and returned $883 million to shareholders, including $700 million in buybacks and dividends, and dividends which were increased 13% in the quarter. For the year, we have now assumed $1.7 billion in share repurchases including the proceeds from divestitures, which leaves us with plenty of liquidity given the environment. Moving to 2020 guidance, we expect organic revenue growth of 3% to 5% versus the prior 5% to 7% as we consider risks related to our commercial aerospace, International and Public Safety businesses due to the pandemic. On margins again, we are expanding guidance at the upper end and hovering the range to 17.4% to 17.6%, and we expect earnings per share of $11.15 to $11.55 with our free cash flow outlook unchanged. Overall I'm proud of the dedication of L3Harris employees and their commitment to the mission at hand. And I'm confident in our ability to proactively manage risk, so we can navigate these unprecedented times. So with that, let me turn over to Chris to provide an update on our operations and segment performance.\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Thank you, Bill and good morning everyone. I'll start with what we're doing from an operational standpoint to mitigate business risk due to COVID-19 then shift to our operating performance and results. The management team has taken measures to ensure the safety of our employees at our over 100 facilities. We've modified the workspace especially in areas with high capacity such as our production floors in Rochester, New York and Clifton, New Jersey to either create space for individuals between workstations or to install partitions in social distancing is impossible. In addition we've adjusted our work schedules by implementing multiple shifts or staggered shifts across our company and at several of our locations that have higher risk, we have already implemented temperature checks and health screening before employees enter buildings. We provided PPE to employees, eliminating travel and taking other recommended precautions. The environment changes daily and these safety protocols are mitigating risk and continue to limit disruption for our company. Turning to the supply chain, we\u2019re managing risk daily with crossed company crisis teams established to assess and develop mitigation plans where needed. We've provided essential certification letters to all of our key suppliers globally and continue to engage in active dialogue and analysis to identify areas of vulnerability. With the recent changes by the DoD around its progress payment policy, we expect a slowdown in excess of $100 million of cash to help small businesses during these unprecedented times. As of today we've advanced approximately $80 million and expect to exceed $100 million this week. Now turning to a quarterly segment results on Slide 6. Integrated Mission Systems grew revenue 1% from a ramp in our maritime business and classified programs partially offset by timing and Electro Optical and ISR following double digit performance last year. Order momentum was broad based with a funded book-to-bill above 1.0 in every IMS sector during the quarter resulting in the overall segment 1.37 for the quarter and 1.09 since the merger. One highlight was over $800 million and award activity from our leading position on the Big Safari program. First quarter operating income was up 22% and margin expanded 260 basis points to 14.7% from operational excellence and integration benefit. On Slide 7 Space & Airborne systems revenue increased 7% in the quarter. The solid performance was driven by a production ramp and increased content on the F-35 platform as well as growth on classified programs in Intel & Cyber. Funded book-to-bill was 1.16 for the quarter and about 1.0 since the merger. In the quarter we secured our position as a prime mission integrator for our nation's space domain awareness program called Mosaic. This award is fully exercised has the potential to reach $2 billion. Segment operating income was up 12% and margin expanded 70 basis points to 18.5% driven by strong program execution and integration benefits. On Slide 8 Communication Systems revenue was up 5% for the quarter as DoD tactical benefited from modernization demand that supported weekly deliveries of the two channel multi-band radio increasing by 50% sequentially. Additionally solid growth in broadband communications partially offset by timing of sales and international tactical in prior year strength and public safety factored into the growth rate. Funded book-to-bill has a slight downshift to 0.8% in the quarter due to timing, so it's been solid at 1.03% since the merger. The awards included a $383 million sole source IDIQ from the U.S. Marines for next-generation HF radio systems as part of a multi-year modernization effort and an IDIQ for $500 million from the U.S. Space Force to provide secure and anti-jam satellite communications for the A3M program. Segment operating income was up 11% and margins expanded 120 basis points to 22.9% in the quarter from integration benefits and from strong operational performance partially offset by the mix impact from the ramp and in the tactical radio modernization program. Lastly on Slide 9, Aviation Systems revenue grew 11% in the quarter driven by our defense businesses. Orders outpaced sales on the defense side leading to a funded segment book-to-bill of 1.05% for the quarter and 1.09% since the merger. Segment operating income was up 40% and margins expanded 300 basis points to 14.5% from improved operational efficiencies and integration of benefits. Looking ahead, we expect the headwinds on the commercial side to pick-up. As a result, we\u2019ve taken a number of measures to improve the cost structure based on the market condition. The downturn has also been triggering event that led to over $300 million of non-cash impairments for goodwill and other assets of the segment. We're committed to supporting our employees, our supply base and our customers to ensure we get through this together. With that, I'll turn it over to Jay.\nJay Malave: Thank you, Chris. I'll begin with a quick recap of first quarter results before discussing our revised outlook and liquidity position. Revenue was up 5% and EBIT increased 17% leading to EPS growth of 21% with solid margin expansion of 170 basis points, 17.5% primarily from integration savings and pension benefits. Free cash flow for the quarter was $533 million and we ended the period with 62 days in working capital before purchase accounting adjustments. Overall, solid results in the face of a tough compare and its deteriorating backdrop. Okay. Let's now turn to the 2020 outlook on Slide 10 and I'll provide more color on our updated guidance. Starting with the top line, organic revenue is now expected to be up 3% to 5% versus our original guidance of up 5% to 7% about two thirds of this comes from resetting expectations for our commercial aerospace businesses due to COVID-19 and its impact on the macro environment. When adjusting for the sale of airport security and automation, the remaining business generated about $800 million in sales in 2019 tied to commercial aerospace through training in avionics equipment. Commercial training represents roughly 40% of the sales and includes the manufacturing of simulators and training of new pilots, as well as those of airlines. And within avionics we manufacture and service a number of components including collision avoidance systems, transponders, as well as voice and data recorders. These businesses are tied to broader aviation trends, including air traffic, airline profitability and OEM production rates, which are all under pressure. For instance, IATA has forecasted traffic to be down nearly 50% for the year. As a result, our guidance now reflects approximately $500 million in revenues or a reduction of about half of the sales for the remainder of the year, when compared to 2019 In addition we factored in pressures at our public safety radio's business which in 2019 had $500 million in sales. This business is focused on state and local municipalities in North America which are facing budget and operational constraints due to the pandemic leading to an over 10% decline relative to our prior expectation of low single digit growth. Finally on the international front which comprises roughly 20% of our sales we are now assuming a more flattish outlook versus an increase in the low to mid-single digits previously. In contrast we expect higher revenues from our DOD businesses including tactical radios and ISR. On a margin outlook Bill talked about the acceleration of integration and productivity benefits that drive that 25 basis points increase in our margin guide of 17.5% putting us at the upper end of the prior range. And that's net of approximately 30 basis points of headwinds associated with fixed cost absorption from volume declines that we've offset with expense reductions bringing this down to our full year EPS we now see $11.15 to $11.55 or $11.35 at the midpoint down $0.20 as compared to our prior guide midpoint. The range is premised on 270 million shares inclusive of the $1.7 billion in share buybacks noted earlier and a 17% tax rate and bridging EPS it to our prior guide on Slide 12 we were $0.15 in headwinds from the timing of divestitures and repurchases while the $0.52 in COVID related headwinds are merely offset by incremental synergies and improved performance from midpoint to midpoint. Finally a quick note on the profile of EPS for the remainder of the year we expect the pandemic related impact to be most notable in the second quarter with stronger growth anticipated in the second half. Moving to free cash flow our guide up $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion is intact and so is the multi-year outlook. For this year our cash flow is bolstered by accelerated synergies, federal stimulus and cost takeout, which will offset the reduced revenues discussed earlier. In our working capital, we'll also look to manage the environment for a three-day goal of improvement in 2020 remains in place as well. Moving over to liquidity, as Bill noted earlier we remain in a strong position. We ended the first quarter with over $400 million of cash on hand, net of the April debt maturity and a $2 billion untapped credit revolver. We're looking ahead to the end of the second quarter our liquidity should reach over $3.5 billion post divestitures which would include at least $1.5 billion in cash and full access to the revolver. Also our net debt maturity of $650 million isn't due until early 2021 and our balance sheet is healthy at 2 times leverage. Now switching to the segment outlook, we've narrowed our integrated Mission Systems revenue range to be up 5.5% to 7% versus the prior 5% to 7% guidance during primarily by strength in our ISR business. Segment operating margin is projected to be about 13.5% or 25 basis point increase from the previous midpoint reflecting performance to date and increased synergy benefits. Next Space and Airborne systems also narrowed our revenue range a 6% to 7.5% growth driven by modernization and sustainment on the F-35 platform in Mission avionics. Segment operating margin is expected to be 18.75% and is unchanged at the midpoint. Communication Systems revenue is now expected to be up between 3.5% to 5% versus the prior guide of 6.5% to 8.5% this reflects headwinds in our public safety business of about 1.5 points and a reduction of international volumes in tactical radios and in integrated vision. Segment operating margin is anticipated to be about 23.75% that's up 100 basis points relative to the prior midpoint reflecting increased cost and integration benefits. And finally in Aviation Systems we're forecasting an organic revenue decline of 1% to 5% year-over-year primarily from the factors I noted earlier in commercial aerospace. This points to reported revenues of approximately $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion for the year post divestitures. On the commercial side, revenues are set to be down around 35% organically for the year and for government related businesses which include mission networks, military training and defense aviation products, they are expected to be up in the mid to high single digits. Segment operating margins are expected to be approximately 13.25% down versus the prior guide by 75 basis points from the midpoint, due primarily to fixed cost absorption from the volume declines partially offset by cost actions. The margin guide also accounts for the airport security and automation divestiture we closed yesterday. So to summarize and put it all together, overall pullback in our outlook, but one with a pandemic related impacts have been nearly offset by management actions with the remainder being the result of a more flexible approach to capital deployment in this environment. With that, I\u2019ll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nCarter Copeland: Just a quick clarification and a question I wondered Jay if you could give us a little bit more color on the cash bridge on the guidance for all the moving pieces with AS and tax and suppliers and progress payments and synergies. I think that would help everyone and just bigger picture Bill or Chris you know with respect to how the business, the combined business is evolving? I mean you highlighted the synergy opportunities, the revenue synergy opportunities you look at that opportunity pipeline. You look at what the business is going to look like in the wake of COVID-19. How does all of this influence your thoughts on portfolio and shaping and whatnot, any updated thoughts there would be great? Thanks.\nJay Malave: Sure, Carter. Let me start with the free cash flow, as we mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, we have the benefit of the progress payments going from 80% to 90%. That an excess of around $100 million that's being slowed down to the suppliers, and so net-net that's a very little impact. There is a benefit and stimulus related to taxes, which is helping us offset some of the other impacts across the business. But when you take a look at net income, that is moving, but as I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well, we've largely offset that. And so, with the benefit of the stimulus efforts, we're just holding that as a placeholder. We may have to go deeper into supplier payments. We may have to think about our pension contributions and things like that. But for the most part, we've held the working capital intact after three days. Net income is a little bit lower. We're getting benefits from the stimulus efforts and we're just kind of holding that as a placeholder for other things for later in the year.\nWilliam Brown: And Carter on your question on - for the long-term outlook, look we're very pleased with the progress of the integration so far, the cost synergies are going very, very well. We're finding great opportunities and revenue opportunities and it's testament to the power of the combined portfolio as we laid out 18 months ago, when we announced the merger. And the areas that we could offer new mission sets to our customers and the COVID-19 notwithstanding, it's playing out as we had expected. We have much more powerful competitive offering and it's helping us quite substantially in mitigating some of the risks that we\u2019re seeing coming through in small parts of the portfolio now through the pandemic. Now in the portfolio shaping we've been at this now for 18 months, we've made some good progress here. We've about a third of the way through in terms of the revenue we anticipated, divesting. We had sized that for investors back in early February that was pre-COVID. We keep looking at the portfolio, it's an ongoing process, but we're going to shape our decisions on what is in our portfolio based on long-term strategy. Our ability to differentiate via technology, ability to grow and win in those segments and that hasn't changed based on the pandemic. We continue to look at that. I don\u2019t know Chris if you wanted to maybe augment with that.\nChris Kubasik: Carter I\u2019ll just chime in that when I look at our new business opportunities and some of the things we're currently working on I continue to believe our portfolio is well aligned with our customers focus and desire. You hear a lot about multi-function systems which we are currently implementing in space. We are submitting white papers on ABMS and of course the Navy's coming out with an offering or and RFP on Spectral. So I think we're well aligned there on the capability front. And then the modular open system architecture I think the F-35 is a good example of those capabilities. So I think it positions us well for the long-term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Strauss of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Strauss: So Bill, just wanted to ask on working capital progress. It doesn't sound like the progress payment change benefited you at all in Q1. But you got two days of sequential improvement I think you\u2019d talked about that in Q1 you might have given back some of the upside that you saw in early collections in Q4. And so, maybe just comment on that and I think from here you're only assuming about one day of additional working capital improvement through the rest of the year? Thanks.\nWilliam Brown: Yes David that's all factual prog pay did really - it benefited us in the first quarter. It\u2019s really just starting now in some ways. It's not a big part of our portfolio it's only about 7% of our revenue so you're not going to see big numbers. And as Jay and others and Chris pointed out what we're receiving from the government through progress payment acceleration we're flowing that out to the supplier base. So that net-net won't be a factor in the year. So we're making good progress. So two days sequentially 10 days operationally since the beginning of when we closed on the merger it's - I think it's just fantastic work that the team has done. A lot of it's coming out of inventory. We're seeing some opportunities elsewhere, but a lot of inventory coming out as we've been pointing out to investors for some time. And we're expecting maybe another day towards the balance of the year. There's some purchase accounting opportunities here if you will, in the year. So we'll end this year below 60 probably in a 58 day range. And as we look out the next couple of years again three to four days per year in 2021 three or four days in 2022. So we - see ourselves around 50 days of working capital by the time we get out into 2022 which as you know we\u2019re still about five days higher than our peers were at the end of 2019 and about 10 days higher than where Harris was before we closed on the transaction. So, we still see some good opportunities to continue to drive working capital performance beyond 2022.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Robert Stallard of Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Stallard: On the adjustment to the aviation guidance for the year I was wondering if you could elaborate on whether this has resulted from the order intake or the conversations with your customers or whether it is your best estimate at this stage is relatively early days. And in relation to that Chris, I was wondering if you could comment on what sort of flexibility you have to reallocate cost or capacity in the aerospace business to defense or elsewhere? Thank you.\nWilliam Brown: So Rob really on both I mean Jay went through the details I think pretty carefully in his script. So the business that was $800 million going down to $500 million so down 40%. We talked about the components to be very clear. Training is about 40% you know effectively what - and that we see being down 40%, 45% for the year. But in fact what we\u2019ve done is that we won't sell any new full flight simulators beyond Q1, so we sort of zero that out that could be conservative. But that\u2019s what we\u2019ve assumed so far, it is through conversations with the airlines, with OEMs, it's really pretty detailed bottoms up analysis that the team has done and really is worked on over the last four to six weeks. I think he's done a good job on that, 60% of the businesses is avionics we see that business down for the year around 30%. But it's got several components, there's a commercial OE and aftermarket component that obviously that's going to be down substantially based on line race that we're hearing from Airbus and Boeing based on I added data on our RPK. There's a piece of it that provides military avionics. In other words it provides avionics on a commercial platform that's military in use that's relatively stable, which is why avionics isn't being hit quite as much as you might expect. So for the year, we've got quite a bit of the back end of the year in backlog we're watching this very, very carefully watching order intake rate. And we think based on what we see today, we've sized it appropriately, again but it's a very, very volatile environment and we're watching it very closely. Now let maybe Chris talk about some of the shifts that are happening in the workforce.\nChris Kubasik: Yes, good morning, Robert. We\u2019ve taken the actions in commercial aviation to reduce the cost with the operating expense maybe down $20 million for the remainder of the year. And we've been pretty aggressive with reductions enforced and furloughs. But to your question specifically on the engineering front as of today we have over 50 engineers that were working on the avionics products that have been redeployed to DoD work. And now that we're all learning how to work remotely and, a little more creatively not many of those individuals needed to relocate. So, I think it's a good story relative to the engineering talent.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nGautam Khanna: Just a couple of questions. First on communications systems I was wondering in the revised guidance sort of what\u2019s the anticipated or in tactical RF change relative to what the prior was? And at PSPC you know how much of a lingering drag beyond 2020 do you anticipate being as a result of the recession?\nWilliam Brown: So Gautam I\u2019ll. You know let me touch on both of those pieces. So overall tactic we had I think a pretty good start to the year we're up 12%. The DOD was really strong international was down mid-teens and pretty close to what we had expected it will be down that same range in the second quarter as well recovering in the back half. You'll start to see a little softer year-over-year growth in DOD simply because of the tough compare. So now what we see international to be is roughly flat for the year before we thought it would be up low to mid-single digit so call that 3% so now about flat. You know in that flatness we still see the APAC or Asia-Pacific region up low double digits Central Asia up significantly you know because of Afghanistan and some of the drawdown that\u2019s happening there. You know we still see Middle East Africa to be up low single digits but that has come down from the last guidance. So Europe will be down mid-single digits. We know Western Europe is getting a little bit better. Eastern Europe still going to be down. And then that's really - those really the bigger pieces here. Central America is roughly flat and Canada is going to be down as we had expected in the year. So overall, we still see DoD being up, in fact a little bit better, up low to mid-teens around 14%. Now we know we see international being about flat. On Public Safety, we've had a very good run here, over the last six quarters to eight quarters have been very, very strong. There's been growing like last year was close to 20% growth. Margins were coming up. We've got a great product line better quality, really good execution. So we felt very good about that. This year we were guiding to low single digits, which is in line with the LMR growth rate in North America. You know as Jay pointed out, you know down more than 10 points from that, so call it down 10%, so it's about $60 million of revenue erosion. You know we'll see that pretty prominently here in the second quarter and probably you'll see it'll - about the same to the balance of the year, it's going to be a pretty tough back end of the year for Public Safety. I think beyond 2020, it depends on what happens to the economy, state and tax - state and local tax revenues. Right now we're fighting in Q2 not just a revenue impact, but just the fact that you have the states and localities dealing with coded and not able to work, doing an installed system that's Public Safety. So we're hopeful, we could get a little better in 2021, but it's too soon to say that, got them.\nGautam Khanna: Now that\u2019s a very helpful overview. And then just maybe I missed that the integration, Integrated Vision Systems, what\u2019s going on there, in terms of decline, maybe I missed a misheard you in the opening remarks, but what sort of, what changed?\nWilliam Brown: You\u2019re talking about IMS, the Integrated Missions Systems business?\nChris Kubasik: Integrated Vision.\nGautam Khanna: Yes. Is there any\u2026\nWilliam Brown: Oh, Integrated Vision, the night vision business?\nGautam Khanna: Integrated Vision Systems, I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s not IMS segment?\nWilliam Brown: Yes. Integrated Vision Systems is performing well on the ENVG program. We're meeting our delivery schedules and looking forward to additional opportunities later in the year that's more domestically. I think that the question is probably related to some of the opportunities we have in the Middle East and we talked about you know more conservatism in the Mideast. We have not had any cancellations. What we're seeing are delays or holdups. And I think a lot of that has just ties to the several factors. You know the export approval process including congressional notification is a whole new process and it's all being done remotely and virtually. And some of our international customers are working remotely. Some have closed their ministries and some actually have curfews in place. We just see all those items contributing to more of a timing issues, so we reduced the outlook there if that helps.\nChris Kubasik: But still it's still lower to mid-single digits in night vision for the year.\nGautam Khanna: And that was compared to what it was the prior?\nChris Kubasik: It was in the low double-digits.\nOperator: Our next question is Doug Harned with Alliance Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Harned: You know when you when you talk about the about the synergies you're ahead of plan $165 million that synergies for 2020 and you've had the - and you've also had I would assume some impediments from COVID-19. I mean this seems like awfully good progress. I mean how does this give you more optimism when you look at that $300 million net synergy total overall. And I'd say that from two things. One is you're ahead of plan here, but also you're ahead of plan and perhaps you could have even done better had you not had the COVID-19 issues?\nJay Malave: Yes. We're making really good progress here Doug. Look we did move forward the $500 million, $300 million net, which we had expected in calendar 2022 to calendar 2021. So we're not going to be done at the end of 2021. We're going to continue working this into 2022, and will become part of normal operations. So we do expect that the ultimate synergy value coming out of this merger is going to be beyond the $500 million and $300 million we've talked about previously because we're seeing it already it\u2019s coming forward and it's likely to go up. So we had $65 million in a stub year, we start out of the gauge very, very quickly. I wouldn\u2019t say it was conservatism coming into this year, but we were still a fairly new company. There were a lot of moving parts in the year. We guided to an incremental $115 million in net synergies earlier this year that's getting quite a bit better, more visibility that we're seeing right now in indirect spend. We've seen the consolidation of all of our benefits programs now being completely implemented. All of the CHQ and segment consolidations are now essentially done. We're just seeing just better progress. So is there any impact from COVID it is probably on the fringes there are going to be some issues that we might have that are already embedded in these numbers that we're talking about here, Doug. Some of the opportunities are really supply chain related they may slip out a little bit, but we feel very good about the trajectory we happen to be on. We've got a very seasoned integration team people that know how to work and drive their jobs in and are doing a great job remotely. So we feel good about this. And if anything we have maybe a little more opportunity in the year as opposed to risk.\nOperator: Our next question is Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nNoah Poponak: Bill just trying to rethink through the 2022 $3 billion free cash flow target as we all do every quarter. And at one point it looked pretty conservative. It's now taken the hit of you know if you're going to divest 8% to 10% of the revenues, and then if there is still aerospace coronavirus impacts that far out. But you're reiterating 2020 with the business so to lay those out of the free cash flow and then the reset the aerospace businesses and then the $3 billion is kind of 5% or 6% growth each of the next two years. So I guess one, just kind of high level, do you still view that number as having some conservatism in it or is it just sort of hanging on despite the hits that it's taken and specifically in the aerospace businesses, do those need to recover by then to get to the $3 billion, or it can they actually just walk along the bottom and you can still get to the $3 billion?\nChris Kubasik: Well, let me start here Noah. Again $3 billion as Bill mentioned is premised on us being able to continue to get improvement in the working capital to around run the 50 days. We still see in spite of the business where things are today, the path to be able to deliver that. We've identified the opportunities in a lot of that as Bill mentioned is sitting in inventory and a lot of those benefits weren't necessarily pegged to the commercial business or some of it that was there and yes, we'll see it that at the lower cash flow projection than we otherwise would have before the COVID-19 in commercial. But we have the runway and in working capital to be able to do that. As Bill mentioned, we see the path, it's not going that it's certainly it\u2019s going to be more challenging than it was before, but I wouldn't care - I wouldn't characterize it as hanging on. I would say that perhaps our buffer our questions is a little bit lower than it was before, but - but the path is still very clear to us.\nNoah Poponak: Okay, that's really helpful. And Jay just a quick follow-up on the free cash flow and any ability to articulate to us what you know ongoing seasonality through the year should be because I - if I remember correctly you had discussed pulling some forward into the fourth quarter of 2019, but then the first quarter of 2020 is better than expected. I know you have some, I know there is a lot of moving pieces in there, but should the free cash flow through the years going forward be relatively level loaded or should it be a pretty steep ramp through the year?\nJay Malave: It's probably somewhere a mix between the two. It's been kind of back end loaded over the past number of years I would say in 2019, even 2019 was a little bit more level loaded. This year you know $533 million is a pretty consistent with what we did for the two companies combined last year. And so our goal is to make it more linear throughout the year, but I think there is some natural level of linearity in there we're probably be still a little bit more back end loaded there. So yes it'll still probably stay a little back end loaded, but again a lot better than it's been historically in 2019 I think was started that.\nOperator: Our next question Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning Bill, Chris and Jay and thanks for the time. The growth is muted in 2020 at 3% to 5% organic and just from what we've become accustomed to I understand aviation has two points of that headwind. I guess how do we think about some of the revenue capture opportunities and timing whether it's the 41 proposals you mentioned and the three incremental down flex this quarter and or how the core business just accelerates in 2020 and 2021.\nChris Kubasik: Sheila, thanks so much for the question. The revenue synergies you know rolling out over the next probably 12 to 18 months. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, orders are in the tens of millions they could grow more substantial in 2021 and 2022 they required that were down select. They have to be then finally awarded and they start to build in time again year and a half order or so. So yes, we're down we're at 3% to 5% this year. The defense business remains very good for us, it's up around 8% you know international is as Jay mentioned we're flattish, but the commercial part of the portfolio which is aerospace public safety is going to be down more than 20%. So the defense piece, the core defense part of the organization is very healthy it's high single-digits. And as we look out over in the next year, we you know we've got, we see you know good bookings this year. We see a very good pipeline about $64 billion of pipeline of opportunities; it's up about 8% since we closed on the merger. We have revenue synergy opportunities are starting to kick in. So I see us getting back in 2021, 2022 to more in that mid-single-digit range. We'll see how the next nine months play out this year and what happens with the COVID pandemic, but in the budget process beyond 2021. But you know I think things should recover, we\u2019ll be in pretty good shape beyond this year.\nOperator: Our next question Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. Sorry, we have lost his line. We\u2019ll move to Jon Raviv with Citi. Please proceed.\nJon Raviv: Bill and Jay, can you talk about capital allocation, I do certainly appreciate the message around growing free cash flow per share, and how repurchases is a big tool for you guys. But can you address that tool in an environment where potentially the norm can move against repurchases, what else could you do with cash in that kind of dynamic?\nJay Malave: Well, look, I mean, for - at the moment Jon I mean, our overall philosophy on capital deployment really hasn't changed. We're going to drive and generate substantial free cash. We're going to pay an attractive dividend that has a payout ratio in the 30% to 35% range; we saw back in February raised a dividend by 13%, 10% back in August last year. So we\u2019ll continue to be committed to paying an attractive dividend. We don't have our leverage ratio as Jay pointed out is pretty attractive. Anything debt that's coming due will likely be refinanced, so that will be a pull on cash. We don't see pension contributions for probably another year or two depending upon what happens in rates and returns this year. So it does leave a lot of capacity for deployment. And at the moment, we're still committed to returning that to shareholders in the form of repurchases. I have mentioned in my remarks for the year we're going to be a $1.7 billion. So we\u2019ll return the $1 billion in proceeds from selling SDS. Beyond that we'll pause it, but then you have a tremendous amount of capacity back into the year a lot of the liquidity and I see the sort of normalizing as we get into calendar 2021.\nOperator: Our next question Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nRon Epstein: You\u2019ve mentioned the $64 billion of opportunities now with the joint company. Can you talk about some of those that are more due to your term? I think we can keep an eye on it to keep score on how you're doing relative to the $64 million opportunities.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning Ron, it's Chris. We have several opportunities that I think are a little more significant you can track later in the third quarter of the current plan is for the Next Gen Jammer contract to be awarded the competitive opportunity. I think that will be an interesting to watch. We've talked a lot about our responsive satellites. We've been getting orders and continue to get orders on those satellites. So you can track that. On the ISR front you know we've talked a lot about the Peregrine program in Australia that will have follow-on opportunities but we also have comparable opportunities in Italy and elsewhere around the world. The EW capabilities are reined UAE comes to mind. Clearly the tactical radios we have a fair amount to go here in 2020. And then even on the international front, we're on the maritime theme with a variety of OEMs and ship builders from Romania to Taiwan to Australia, so you will be able to track those or highlight those as the couple to follow on.\nRon Epstein: And if I may just a follow on quickly, do you guys have a position on the Frigate program that was just awarded to Finmeccanica and [indiscernible].\nWilliam Brown: Yes, great question. We have you know there were four beds and given our capabilities we were on all four of the teams. So as you would imagine, I think we're well-positioned with Finmeccanica marine and more to come on that. Usually they pick the frigate first and then the second tier suppliers are negotiated and competed, but we feel very comfortable with our capabilities and being able to participate on that program.\nOperator: Our next question is Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Arment: Good morning, Bill, Chris and Jay. Bill you gave us some color on the international just flat for the year, I mean what kind of visibility to have our conversations with your customers I know Chris mentioned that there's some export offices are closed or some customers are even closed just thinking about growth actually exit you know COVID-19 worldwide what people kind of focus you need to see in the second half of this year. Thanks.\nWilliam Brown: Well, we said we think the revenue in international will be roughly flattish year, so clearly you know booking some of the orders that are important back have will require engaging with customers happening today via phone, but we\u2019re going to sort of start to see an ability to key customers to demonstrate product sign contracts and that's going to require some face to face conversation. So there's a lot of dialogue happening right now. We're trying to get a sense for the timing of some of the opportunities we have in the back end of the year. We think it was appropriate given some of the short-term nature of the opportunities in tactical - and make sure optical to pull that out as which will be done here to recalibrate international for the year. But as this thing starts to open up, we've got a pretty good team internationally and - they're out there, meeting with their customers, talking to their customers and we'll see, as we get towards the back end of the year, how the orders flow through.\nPeter Arment: Okay, thanks. Just a quick follow-up Chris, is there any incoming - from the Wescam, regarding just from a demography perspective, just an opportunity in the COVID-19 world? Thanks.\nChris Kubasik: Yes, the Wescam business is doing quite well. I think, if you're referring to doing some sort of thermal imaging or such, it's really not at that price point, its better sticking with their core market and focused on the airborne assets. So, hope that answers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski at Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question.\nPete Skibitski: Bill something I've been curious about kind of top level, is this topic of 5G, and I know it's obviously kind of a commercial standard, but I've also seen you mentioned that DoD is running some pilot projects related to 5G as well. So I'm just curious, if you can give us your thoughts from a top level on whether or not this impacts L3Harris in any way, kind of and/or if we feel like it's a technology you need to be involved in developing or in some other way? Thanks.\nWilliam Brown: Yes Pete, look it's a good question, I won't be able to give you a complete fulsome answer on this, but we've had - an internal team focused on 5G. We're not an inventor, but we certainly have applications that are using 5G technology, so we do play in the space. We need to be present in the area. We need to find DoD or defense related applications of 5G, it's going to affect Warfighter effectiveness. So we do have specific activities here. I wouldn\u2019t say it's a big driver this year, but certainly over time it's a core capability that we need to have as a leader in spectrum superiority. So clearly Pete that's - it's something that is central to our strategy over the next several years.\nPete Skibitski: Okay, more to come, thanks for the color.\nWilliam Brown: More to come.\nOperator: Our next question Myles Walton with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMyles Walton: Maybe Bill - in addition to the higher progress payments the DoD seems to be also biding pretty aggressive on pulling forward contract awards and getting kind of the money out of the hands of the DoD and obligating that as quick as they can. I'm just curious did you see that in the quarter obviously good booking at SAS and IMS or is that something that might help bookings continued to be strong in second quarter and third quarter?\nWilliam Brown: Look Myles it\u2019s a good question, credit due to the folks in DoD really across the services we've had very active dialogue both Chris and I and some others on the team with a lot of leaders across DoD and across the services. And they've been very aggressive not just on prog pay, but accelerating awards. You probably heard you know Hondo at the Navy accelerating quite substantially awards. So we did see some opportunities move left some out of Q2 into Q1 some out of the back half of the year into the front half. Chris mentioned A3M that's an opportunity we saw an acceleration of an opportunity in IMS the Virginia AMP. So we did see some opportunities moving left and I think that we'll continue to see that it's you know the DoD is really focused on this. They are trying to put money on contract that we then quickly then put suppliers on contracts. So we keep not just cash flowing, but opportunities flowing into the supply base. So certainly something we're all focused on.\nMyles Walton: Okay. And clarification Jay on the slide on the lock of EPS, there's pension called out under operations another $0.28, how much of that $0.28 is pension?\nJay Malave: About $0.10 in that $0.28, there is a lot of moving parts in there. But the pension is incremental about $25 million.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Just as - I guess as you guys are thinking about COVID related impacts disruptions any other color that you have on your broader supply chain. I mean you guys are pretty technology driven I'm sure there's a lot of smaller components, subsystems, discrete electronics you're procuring? Are you seeing any potential risk either from parts procured and the Asia-Pacific geography or how are you kind of sizing that potential risk as you go forward here any need to build buffer stock of inventory on certain maybe at risk product lines?\nChris Kubasik: Yes great, great question, this is Chris. On any given day, there is tens of millions of revenue risk it changes on a weekly basis. We really started looking at this back in January in the Asian markets I think we've been able to mitigate all that risk. And a lot of this depends on the countries India shuts down, Mexico shuts down, we have to monitor those suppliers look for second sources, but I think we're doing a real good job. We have a dedicated team focus specifically on COVID supply chain and Bill and I gets daily updates on the progress. So great question, we're trying to use predictive analysis, identify the risks and mitigate it on a regular basis, hope that helps.\nOperator: And our final question comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Spingarn: Two quick things, Bill on the state and local budget constraints you talked about before in public safety. How do you think about, how the crisis may have revealed any shortcomings in the public safety communications and what might be the opportunity coming out of this thing? And then I have a higher level question, just on budget austerity and how you and Chris think about the possibility that some you know that the budget the defense budget at some point will be funding stimulus repayment that sort of thing, not necessarily what we saw 10 years ago, but some kind of shift in spending priorities at the federal level couple years down the road?\nWilliam Brown: So hey, look really good questions, on public safety i.e. this could drive an accelerated shift from LMR to LTE that's been gaining some steam with FirstNet. Fortunately we've got a radio that is LMR LTE capable both qualifiable by ATT and Verizon. So I think we're really well-positioned for that transition. I think that having a domestic supply base here is important in that particular area. We have certain technology and applications that could allow us to open up new markets that go beyond first responders to healthcare providers that we've seen that happen over the last couple of months. So the state and local finances I think will be impacted in the near to medium-term and we've tried to capture that in our thoughts, but it could drive an acceleration from LMR to LTE. And relative to your question on the budget, so as you know the 2021 budget came out a couple of months ago from the President including I think 2% per year growth in the fight that obviously was all pre-COVID. Lot discussion happening right now between the authorizer and the appropriators of what the budget will be for 2021, it - came out about flattish from the President. A lot of the things that we're focused on are well funded and in that including a lot of the classified budgets look pretty good. There's $135 billion of - so if you will surplus investment account funding that still remains out there it\u2019s going to provide a little bit of tailwind to us. As you gotten to 2022 beyond 2022 into 2023 you've got an election year. Eventually you got a $4 trillion deficit that know going to have to be sort of paid for in some ways, but at the same time you got a very dangerous world you could see what the North Koreans are doing, what the Iranians are doing, what Chinese are doing and Russia. So we're going to continue to be tested. The threats remain there and the investments that the DoD is trying to make are really long-term investments in technology back to sustain beyond the next couple of years. And I'm hopeful that that will be a bipartisan alignment to make sure we continue to fund the DoD. So thanks very much for that question, Rob. I appreciate that.\nWilliam Brown: So thank you all for joining the call this morning. During these uncertain times, we're managing risks aggressively and taking appropriate actions to drive value for all of our shareowners. I hope we\u2019ll soon be operating under more favorable conditions. I want to close by thanking our employees for going above and beyond to support our customers and our essential missions as well as the healthcare workers first responders and everyone in the frontline fighting COVID-19. Thank you all. And be safe.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Chris Kubasik",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Bill and good morning everyone. I'll start with what we're doing from an operational standpoint to mitigate business risk due to COVID-19 then shift to our operating performance and results. The management team has taken measures to ensure the safety of our employees at our over 100 facilities. We've modified the workspace especially in areas with high capacity such as our production floors in Rochester, New York and Clifton, New Jersey to either create space for individuals between workstations or to install partitions in social distancing is impossible. In addition we've adjusted our work schedules by implementing multiple shifts or staggered shifts across our company and at several of our locations that have higher risk, we have already implemented temperature checks and health screening before employees enter buildings. We provided PPE to employees, eliminating travel and taking other recommended precautions. The environment changes daily and these safety protocols are mitigating risk and continue to limit disruption for our company. Turning to the supply chain, we're managing risk daily with crossed company crisis teams established to assess and develop mitigation plans where needed. We've provided essential certification letters to all of our key suppliers globally and continue to engage in active dialogue and analysis to identify areas of vulnerability. With the recent changes by the DoD around its progress payment policy, we expect a slowdown in excess of $100 million of cash to help small businesses during these unprecedented times. As of today we've advanced approximately $80 million and expect to exceed $100 million this week. Now turning to a quarterly segment results on Slide 6. Integrated Mission Systems grew revenue 1% from a ramp in our maritime business and classified programs partially offset by timing and Electro Optical and ISR following double digit performance last year. Order momentum was broad based with a funded book-to-bill above 1.0 in every IMS sector during the quarter resulting in the overall segment 1.37 for the quarter and 1.09 since the merger. One highlight was over $800 million and award activity from our leading position on the Big Safari program. First quarter operating income was up 22% and margin expanded 260 basis points to 14.7% from operational excellence and integration benefit. On Slide 7 Space & Airborne systems revenue increased 7% in the quarter. The solid performance was driven by a production ramp and increased content on the F-35 platform as well as growth on classified programs in Intel & Cyber. Funded book-to-bill was 1.16 for the quarter and about 1.0 since the merger. In the quarter we secured our position as a prime mission integrator for our nation's space domain awareness program called Mosaic. This award is fully exercised has the potential to reach $2 billion. Segment operating income was up 12% and margin expanded 70 basis points to 18.5% driven by strong program execution and integration benefits. On Slide 8 Communication Systems revenue was up 5% for the quarter as DoD tactical benefited from modernization demand that supported weekly deliveries of the two channel multi-band radio increasing by 50% sequentially. Additionally solid growth in broadband communications partially offset by timing of sales and international tactical in prior year strength and public safety factored into the growth rate. Funded book-to-bill has a slight downshift to 0.8% in the quarter due to timing, so it's been solid at 1.03% since the merger. The awards included a $383 million sole source IDIQ from the U.S. Marines for next-generation HF radio systems as part of a multi-year modernization effort and an IDIQ for $500 million from the U.S. Space Force to provide secure and anti-jam satellite communications for the A3M program. Segment operating income was up 11% and margins expanded 120 basis points to 22.9% in the quarter from integration benefits and from strong operational performance partially offset by the mix impact from the ramp and in the tactical radio modernization program. Lastly on Slide 9, Aviation Systems revenue grew 11% in the quarter driven by our defense businesses. Orders outpaced sales on the defense side leading to a funded segment book-to-bill of 1.05% for the quarter and 1.09% since the merger. Segment operating income was up 40% and margins expanded 300 basis points to 14.5% from improved operational efficiencies and integration of benefits. Looking ahead, we expect the headwinds on the commercial side to pick-up. As a result, we've taken a number of measures to improve the cost structure based on the market condition. The downturn has also been triggering event that led to over $300 million of non-cash impairments for goodwill and other assets of the segment. We're committed to supporting our employees, our supply base and our customers to ensure we get through this together. With that, I'll turn it over to Jay. Carter I'll just chime in that when I look at our new business opportunities and some of the things we're currently working on I continue to believe our portfolio is well aligned with our customers focus and desire. You hear a lot about multi-function systems which we are currently implementing in space. We are submitting white papers on ABMS and of course the Navy's coming out with an offering or and RFP on Spectral. So I think we're well aligned there on the capability front. And then the modular open system architecture I think the F-35 is a good example of those capabilities. So I think it positions us well for the long-term. Yes, good morning, Robert. We've taken the actions in commercial aviation to reduce the cost with the operating expense maybe down $20 million for the remainder of the year. And we've been pretty aggressive with reductions enforced and furloughs. But to your question specifically on the engineering front as of today we have over 50 engineers that were working on the avionics products that have been redeployed to DoD work. And now that we're all learning how to work remotely and, a little more creatively not many of those individuals needed to relocate. So, I think it's a good story relative to the engineering talent. Integrated Vision. But still it's still lower to mid-single digits in night vision for the year. It was in the low double-digits. Well, let me start here Noah. Again $3 billion as Bill mentioned is premised on us being able to continue to get improvement in the working capital to around run the 50 days. We still see in spite of the business where things are today, the path to be able to deliver that. We've identified the opportunities in a lot of that as Bill mentioned is sitting in inventory and a lot of those benefits weren't necessarily pegged to the commercial business or some of it that was there and yes, we'll see it that at the lower cash flow projection than we otherwise would have before the COVID-19 in commercial. But we have the runway and in working capital to be able to do that. As Bill mentioned, we see the path, it's not going that it's certainly it's going to be more challenging than it was before, but I wouldn't care - I wouldn't characterize it as hanging on. I would say that perhaps our buffer our questions is a little bit lower than it was before, but - but the path is still very clear to us. Sheila, thanks so much for the question. The revenue synergies you know rolling out over the next probably 12 to 18 months. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, orders are in the tens of millions they could grow more substantial in 2021 and 2022 they required that were down select. They have to be then finally awarded and they start to build in time again year and a half order or so. So yes, we're down we're at 3% to 5% this year. The defense business remains very good for us, it's up around 8% you know international is as Jay mentioned we're flattish, but the commercial part of the portfolio which is aerospace public safety is going to be down more than 20%. So the defense piece, the core defense part of the organization is very healthy it's high single-digits. And as we look out over in the next year, we you know we've got, we see you know good bookings this year. We see a very good pipeline about $64 billion of pipeline of opportunities; it's up about 8% since we closed on the merger. We have revenue synergy opportunities are starting to kick in. So I see us getting back in 2021, 2022 to more in that mid-single-digit range. We'll see how the next nine months play out this year and what happens with the COVID pandemic, but in the budget process beyond 2021. But you know I think things should recover, we'll be in pretty good shape beyond this year. Good morning Ron, it's Chris. We have several opportunities that I think are a little more significant you can track later in the third quarter of the current plan is for the Next Gen Jammer contract to be awarded the competitive opportunity. I think that will be an interesting to watch. We've talked a lot about our responsive satellites. We've been getting orders and continue to get orders on those satellites. So you can track that. On the ISR front you know we've talked a lot about the Peregrine program in Australia that will have follow-on opportunities but we also have comparable opportunities in Italy and elsewhere around the world. The EW capabilities are reined UAE comes to mind. Clearly the tactical radios we have a fair amount to go here in 2020. And then even on the international front, we're on the maritime theme with a variety of OEMs and ship builders from Romania to Taiwan to Australia, so you will be able to track those or highlight those as the couple to follow on. Yes, the Wescam business is doing quite well. I think, if you're referring to doing some sort of thermal imaging or such, it's really not at that price point, its better sticking with their core market and focused on the airborne assets. So, hope that answers. Yes great, great question, this is Chris. On any given day, there is tens of millions of revenue risk it changes on a weekly basis. We really started looking at this back in January in the Asian markets I think we've been able to mitigate all that risk. And a lot of this depends on the countries India shuts down, Mexico shuts down, we have to monitor those suppliers look for second sources, but I think we're doing a real good job. We have a dedicated team focus specifically on COVID supply chain and Bill and I gets daily updates on the progress. So great question, we're trying to use predictive analysis, identify the risks and mitigate it on a regular basis, hope that helps."

            "name": "William Brown",
            "content": "Okay. Well, thank you, Rajeev and good morning everyone. As we're all aware the environment has changed considerably since our last update due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Our top priority remains the safety and well-being of our employees while continuing to deliver the mission essential products and services to our customers. And I will start by thanking all of our employees for their hard work and dedication through this crisis. While we have a resilient portfolio and customer base and we're well-positioned, we're not immune to the effects of COVID-19. Despite the solid start to the year, we're trimming our outlook for revenue and earnings per share due principally to our commercial aerospace exposure and our recently completed divestiture plus some anticipated softness in international and Public Safety and potential risks from supply chain disruption. We move quickly with cost and other actions to offset these headwinds holding earnings per share within 2% of our prior guidance while increasing our margin outlook and maintaining free cash flow. Our core U.S. government business which represents about 75% of revenue is performing well and without significant challenges. Earlier today, we reported first quarter results with non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.80 up 21% on 5% revenue growth. Company margins increased 170 basis points to 17.5% and adjusted free cash flow was $533 million. Total company funded book-to-bill was 1.11 driving funded backlog up 3% versus the prior year. These results were ahead of our expectations. We're actively assessing and monitoring global developments and continue to use best practices to mitigate risks related to COVID-19. We've mandated work from home for those who can, implemented social distancing, and canceled all travel and external events. In our production facilities, we've staggered work shifts, redesigned stations and implemented stringent cleaning protocols. As of today all our facilities are up and running with limited disruptions reported to date. We continue to receive a great deal of support from our key customers the DoD, the FAA, NAS and others and a large majority of our programs and facilities as well as those of our suppliers have been deemed essential to national security. The DoD has moved quickly to adjust the terms of progress payments to drive cash into the industrial base which we have passed through to our small suppliers and started a dialogue with industry on how to size and cover COVID-19 related costs. These measures combined with potential tax deferred benefits through the CARES Act provide some risk mitigation for our company and supply chain. Looking at our credit profile, our balance sheet remains healthy and we expect to have over $3.5 billion in liquidity in the form of cash on hand and revolver availability at the end of the quarter. Jay will discuss this in some more detail. In these uncertain times, we continue to execute well on the strategic priorities that we previously outlined, which is helping us deal with the crisis at hand while at the same time delivering long-term value for our shareholders. First, we continue to make great progress on integration despite the environment. Our team delivered $55 million of net synergies in Q1 from improvements in benefits in overhead costs and we now expect to achieve $165 million of incremental net savings in 2020 up versus our previous expectation of $115 million, as we accelerate savings and manage through the pandemic. And there is no change to achieving $300 million in cumulative net savings or about $500 million gross in 2021, which as we've announced before is about one-year ahead of schedule. Second, we continue to drive a culture of operational excellence deep into the company to improve quality and productivity and expand margins. This was evident in our first quarter results where we built upon last year's performance and delivered E3 savings on top of synergies offset mix headwinds. For the year, the combination of cost synergies and E3 savings allow us to increase full year margin by 25 basis points to 17.5% at the midpoint despite the cost absorption challenge from revenue headwinds and the expenses being occurred to fight the pandemic. And in our working capital we continue on the improvement trajectory from the stub year with another two-day operational reduction since year-end and about 10 days operationally since the merger close primarily from better inventory management. We believe we have the tools and proper focus to manage in the current environment leaving the path of 50 days of working capital intact for 2020. Third is to invest in technology and innovation in anticipation of customer needs to grow revenue in the long run. And we expect to sustain our industry leading spend on R&D despite the pandemic. The team is making terrific progress in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our investments, creating room in our budget to support investment in the growing pipeline of revenue synergy opportunities. We have now submitted 41 revenue synergy proposals, up 18 from last quarter with another 3 down selects out of 8 in the first quarter, primarily related to classified work in our Space and Aviation Systems segments. To-date, we've been down selected on half of the 16 proposals awarded with orders booked in the tens of millions and a lifetime revenue potential of over $2 billion. Our fourth priority is reshaping the portfolio to focus on high margin, high growth and technology differentiated businesses. And this has not changed. So far we've announced three transactions representing about 3% of revenue that will result in about a billion dollars in proceeds. Our airport security and automation business, the largest of these announcements closed yesterday with two smaller ones closing later this month and by mid-year, neither of which have a financing contingency. We're still targeting divestitures in the range of 8% to 10% of revenue including the divestitures announced to-date. And while the timing is now more fluid, we continue to have active discussions and are committed to maximizing value. And then finally, our fifth priority is to maximize cash flow to sustainably grow free cash flow per share. We're maintaining our adjusted free cash flow guide for 2020 at $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion and remain on track to achieve $3 billion in 2022. In the quarter, we generated over $500 million in free cash flow and returned $883 million to shareholders, including $700 million in buybacks and dividends, and dividends which were increased 13% in the quarter. For the year, we have now assumed $1.7 billion in share repurchases including the proceeds from divestitures, which leaves us with plenty of liquidity given the environment. Moving to 2020 guidance, we expect organic revenue growth of 3% to 5% versus the prior 5% to 7% as we consider risks related to our commercial aerospace, International and Public Safety businesses due to the pandemic. On margins again, we are expanding guidance at the upper end and hovering the range to 17.4% to 17.6%, and we expect earnings per share of $11.15 to $11.55 with our free cash flow outlook unchanged. Overall I'm proud of the dedication of L3Harris employees and their commitment to the mission at hand. And I'm confident in our ability to proactively manage risk, so we can navigate these unprecedented times. So with that, let me turn over to Chris to provide an update on our operations and segment performance. And Carter on your question on - for the long-term outlook, look we're very pleased with the progress of the integration so far, the cost synergies are going very, very well. We're finding great opportunities and revenue opportunities and it's testament to the power of the combined portfolio as we laid out 18 months ago, when we announced the merger. And the areas that we could offer new mission sets to our customers and the COVID-19 notwithstanding, it's playing out as we had expected. We have much more powerful competitive offering and it's helping us quite substantially in mitigating some of the risks that we're seeing coming through in small parts of the portfolio now through the pandemic. Now in the portfolio shaping we've been at this now for 18 months, we've made some good progress here. We've about a third of the way through in terms of the revenue we anticipated, divesting. We had sized that for investors back in early February that was pre-COVID. We keep looking at the portfolio, it's an ongoing process, but we're going to shape our decisions on what is in our portfolio based on long-term strategy. Our ability to differentiate via technology, ability to grow and win in those segments and that hasn't changed based on the pandemic. We continue to look at that. I don't know Chris if you wanted to maybe augment with that. Yes David that's all factual prog pay did really - it benefited us in the first quarter. It's really just starting now in some ways. It's not a big part of our portfolio it's only about 7% of our revenue so you're not going to see big numbers. And as Jay and others and Chris pointed out what we're receiving from the government through progress payment acceleration we're flowing that out to the supplier base. So that net-net won't be a factor in the year. So we're making good progress. So two days sequentially 10 days operationally since the beginning of when we closed on the merger it's - I think it's just fantastic work that the team has done. A lot of it's coming out of inventory. We're seeing some opportunities elsewhere, but a lot of inventory coming out as we've been pointing out to investors for some time. And we're expecting maybe another day towards the balance of the year. There's some purchase accounting opportunities here if you will, in the year. So we'll end this year below 60 probably in a 58 day range. And as we look out the next couple of years again three to four days per year in 2021 three or four days in 2022. So we - see ourselves around 50 days of working capital by the time we get out into 2022 which as you know we're still about five days higher than our peers were at the end of 2019 and about 10 days higher than where Harris was before we closed on the transaction. So, we still see some good opportunities to continue to drive working capital performance beyond 2022. So Rob really on both I mean Jay went through the details I think pretty carefully in his script. So the business that was $800 million going down to $500 million so down 40%. We talked about the components to be very clear. Training is about 40% you know effectively what - and that we see being down 40%, 45% for the year. But in fact what we've done is that we won't sell any new full flight simulators beyond Q1, so we sort of zero that out that could be conservative. But that's what we've assumed so far, it is through conversations with the airlines, with OEMs, it's really pretty detailed bottoms up analysis that the team has done and really is worked on over the last four to six weeks. I think he's done a good job on that, 60% of the businesses is avionics we see that business down for the year around 30%. But it's got several components, there's a commercial OE and aftermarket component that obviously that's going to be down substantially based on line race that we're hearing from Airbus and Boeing based on I added data on our RPK. There's a piece of it that provides military avionics. In other words it provides avionics on a commercial platform that's military in use that's relatively stable, which is why avionics isn't being hit quite as much as you might expect. So for the year, we've got quite a bit of the back end of the year in backlog we're watching this very, very carefully watching order intake rate. And we think based on what we see today, we've sized it appropriately, again but it's a very, very volatile environment and we're watching it very closely. Now let maybe Chris talk about some of the shifts that are happening in the workforce. So Gautam I'll. You know let me touch on both of those pieces. So overall tactic we had I think a pretty good start to the year we're up 12%. The DOD was really strong international was down mid-teens and pretty close to what we had expected it will be down that same range in the second quarter as well recovering in the back half. You'll start to see a little softer year-over-year growth in DOD simply because of the tough compare. So now what we see international to be is roughly flat for the year before we thought it would be up low to mid-single digit so call that 3% so now about flat. You know in that flatness we still see the APAC or Asia-Pacific region up low double digits Central Asia up significantly you know because of Afghanistan and some of the drawdown that's happening there. You know we still see Middle East Africa to be up low single digits but that has come down from the last guidance. So Europe will be down mid-single digits. We know Western Europe is getting a little bit better. Eastern Europe still going to be down. And then that's really - those really the bigger pieces here. Central America is roughly flat and Canada is going to be down as we had expected in the year. So overall, we still see DoD being up, in fact a little bit better, up low to mid-teens around 14%. Now we know we see international being about flat. On Public Safety, we've had a very good run here, over the last six quarters to eight quarters have been very, very strong. There's been growing like last year was close to 20% growth. Margins were coming up. We've got a great product line better quality, really good execution. So we felt very good about that. This year we were guiding to low single digits, which is in line with the LMR growth rate in North America. You know as Jay pointed out, you know down more than 10 points from that, so call it down 10%, so it's about $60 million of revenue erosion. You know we'll see that pretty prominently here in the second quarter and probably you'll see it'll - about the same to the balance of the year, it's going to be a pretty tough back end of the year for Public Safety. I think beyond 2020, it depends on what happens to the economy, state and tax - state and local tax revenues. Right now we're fighting in Q2 not just a revenue impact, but just the fact that you have the states and localities dealing with coded and not able to work, doing an installed system that's Public Safety. So we're hopeful, we could get a little better in 2021, but it's too soon to say that, got them. You're talking about IMS, the Integrated Missions Systems business? Oh, Integrated Vision, the night vision business? Yes. Integrated Vision Systems is performing well on the ENVG program. We're meeting our delivery schedules and looking forward to additional opportunities later in the year that's more domestically. I think that the question is probably related to some of the opportunities we have in the Middle East and we talked about you know more conservatism in the Mideast. We have not had any cancellations. What we're seeing are delays or holdups. And I think a lot of that has just ties to the several factors. You know the export approval process including congressional notification is a whole new process and it's all being done remotely and virtually. And some of our international customers are working remotely. Some have closed their ministries and some actually have curfews in place. We just see all those items contributing to more of a timing issues, so we reduced the outlook there if that helps. Yes, great question. We have you know there were four beds and given our capabilities we were on all four of the teams. So as you would imagine, I think we're well-positioned with Finmeccanica marine and more to come on that. Usually they pick the frigate first and then the second tier suppliers are negotiated and competed, but we feel very comfortable with our capabilities and being able to participate on that program. Well, we said we think the revenue in international will be roughly flattish year, so clearly you know booking some of the orders that are important back have will require engaging with customers happening today via phone, but we're going to sort of start to see an ability to key customers to demonstrate product sign contracts and that's going to require some face to face conversation. So there's a lot of dialogue happening right now. We're trying to get a sense for the timing of some of the opportunities we have in the back end of the year. We think it was appropriate given some of the short-term nature of the opportunities in tactical - and make sure optical to pull that out as which will be done here to recalibrate international for the year. But as this thing starts to open up, we've got a pretty good team internationally and - they're out there, meeting with their customers, talking to their customers and we'll see, as we get towards the back end of the year, how the orders flow through. Yes Pete, look it's a good question, I won't be able to give you a complete fulsome answer on this, but we've had - an internal team focused on 5G. We're not an inventor, but we certainly have applications that are using 5G technology, so we do play in the space. We need to be present in the area. We need to find DoD or defense related applications of 5G, it's going to affect Warfighter effectiveness. So we do have specific activities here. I wouldn't say it's a big driver this year, but certainly over time it's a core capability that we need to have as a leader in spectrum superiority. So clearly Pete that's - it's something that is central to our strategy over the next several years. More to come. Look Myles it's a good question, credit due to the folks in DoD really across the services we've had very active dialogue both Chris and I and some others on the team with a lot of leaders across DoD and across the services. And they've been very aggressive not just on prog pay, but accelerating awards. You probably heard you know Hondo at the Navy accelerating quite substantially awards. So we did see some opportunities move left some out of Q2 into Q1 some out of the back half of the year into the front half. Chris mentioned A3M that's an opportunity we saw an acceleration of an opportunity in IMS the Virginia AMP. So we did see some opportunities moving left and I think that we'll continue to see that it's you know the DoD is really focused on this. They are trying to put money on contract that we then quickly then put suppliers on contracts. So we keep not just cash flowing, but opportunities flowing into the supply base. So certainly something we're all focused on. So hey, look really good questions, on public safety i.e. this could drive an accelerated shift from LMR to LTE that's been gaining some steam with FirstNet. Fortunately we've got a radio that is LMR LTE capable both qualifiable by ATT and Verizon. So I think we're really well-positioned for that transition. I think that having a domestic supply base here is important in that particular area. We have certain technology and applications that could allow us to open up new markets that go beyond first responders to healthcare providers that we've seen that happen over the last couple of months. So the state and local finances I think will be impacted in the near to medium-term and we've tried to capture that in our thoughts, but it could drive an acceleration from LMR to LTE. And relative to your question on the budget, so as you know the 2021 budget came out a couple of months ago from the President including I think 2% per year growth in the fight that obviously was all pre-COVID. Lot discussion happening right now between the authorizer and the appropriators of what the budget will be for 2021, it - came out about flattish from the President. A lot of the things that we're focused on are well funded and in that including a lot of the classified budgets look pretty good. There's $135 billion of - so if you will surplus investment account funding that still remains out there it's going to provide a little bit of tailwind to us. As you gotten to 2022 beyond 2022 into 2023 you've got an election year. Eventually you got a $4 trillion deficit that know going to have to be sort of paid for in some ways, but at the same time you got a very dangerous world you could see what the North Koreans are doing, what the Iranians are doing, what Chinese are doing and Russia. So we're going to continue to be tested. The threats remain there and the investments that the DoD is trying to make are really long-term investments in technology back to sustain beyond the next couple of years. And I'm hopeful that that will be a bipartisan alignment to make sure we continue to fund the DoD. So thanks very much for that question, Rob. I appreciate that. So thank you all for joining the call this morning. During these uncertain times, we're managing risks aggressively and taking appropriate actions to drive value for all of our shareowners. I hope we'll soon be operating under more favorable conditions. I want to close by thanking our employees for going above and beyond to support our customers and our essential missions as well as the healthcare workers first responders and everyone in the frontline fighting COVID-19. Thank you all. And be safe."

            "name": "Jay Malave",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. I'll begin with a quick recap of first quarter results before discussing our revised outlook and liquidity position. Revenue was up 5% and EBIT increased 17% leading to EPS growth of 21% with solid margin expansion of 170 basis points, 17.5% primarily from integration savings and pension benefits. Free cash flow for the quarter was $533 million and we ended the period with 62 days in working capital before purchase accounting adjustments. Overall, solid results in the face of a tough compare and its deteriorating backdrop. Okay. Let's now turn to the 2020 outlook on Slide 10 and I'll provide more color on our updated guidance. Starting with the top line, organic revenue is now expected to be up 3% to 5% versus our original guidance of up 5% to 7% about two thirds of this comes from resetting expectations for our commercial aerospace businesses due to COVID-19 and its impact on the macro environment. When adjusting for the sale of airport security and automation, the remaining business generated about $800 million in sales in 2019 tied to commercial aerospace through training in avionics equipment. Commercial training represents roughly 40% of the sales and includes the manufacturing of simulators and training of new pilots, as well as those of airlines. And within avionics we manufacture and service a number of components including collision avoidance systems, transponders, as well as voice and data recorders. These businesses are tied to broader aviation trends, including air traffic, airline profitability and OEM production rates, which are all under pressure. For instance, IATA has forecasted traffic to be down nearly 50% for the year. As a result, our guidance now reflects approximately $500 million in revenues or a reduction of about half of the sales for the remainder of the year, when compared to 2019 In addition we factored in pressures at our public safety radio's business which in 2019 had $500 million in sales. This business is focused on state and local municipalities in North America which are facing budget and operational constraints due to the pandemic leading to an over 10% decline relative to our prior expectation of low single digit growth. Finally on the international front which comprises roughly 20% of our sales we are now assuming a more flattish outlook versus an increase in the low to mid-single digits previously. In contrast we expect higher revenues from our DOD businesses including tactical radios and ISR. On a margin outlook Bill talked about the acceleration of integration and productivity benefits that drive that 25 basis points increase in our margin guide of 17.5% putting us at the upper end of the prior range. And that's net of approximately 30 basis points of headwinds associated with fixed cost absorption from volume declines that we've offset with expense reductions bringing this down to our full year EPS we now see $11.15 to $11.55 or $11.35 at the midpoint down $0.20 as compared to our prior guide midpoint. The range is premised on 270 million shares inclusive of the $1.7 billion in share buybacks noted earlier and a 17% tax rate and bridging EPS it to our prior guide on Slide 12 we were $0.15 in headwinds from the timing of divestitures and repurchases while the $0.52 in COVID related headwinds are merely offset by incremental synergies and improved performance from midpoint to midpoint. Finally a quick note on the profile of EPS for the remainder of the year we expect the pandemic related impact to be most notable in the second quarter with stronger growth anticipated in the second half. Moving to free cash flow our guide up $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion is intact and so is the multi-year outlook. For this year our cash flow is bolstered by accelerated synergies, federal stimulus and cost takeout, which will offset the reduced revenues discussed earlier. In our working capital, we'll also look to manage the environment for a three-day goal of improvement in 2020 remains in place as well. Moving over to liquidity, as Bill noted earlier we remain in a strong position. We ended the first quarter with over $400 million of cash on hand, net of the April debt maturity and a $2 billion untapped credit revolver. We're looking ahead to the end of the second quarter our liquidity should reach over $3.5 billion post divestitures which would include at least $1.5 billion in cash and full access to the revolver. Also our net debt maturity of $650 million isn't due until early 2021 and our balance sheet is healthy at 2 times leverage. Now switching to the segment outlook, we've narrowed our integrated Mission Systems revenue range to be up 5.5% to 7% versus the prior 5% to 7% guidance during primarily by strength in our ISR business. Segment operating margin is projected to be about 13.5% or 25 basis point increase from the previous midpoint reflecting performance to date and increased synergy benefits. Next Space and Airborne systems also narrowed our revenue range a 6% to 7.5% growth driven by modernization and sustainment on the F-35 platform in Mission avionics. Segment operating margin is expected to be 18.75% and is unchanged at the midpoint. Communication Systems revenue is now expected to be up between 3.5% to 5% versus the prior guide of 6.5% to 8.5% this reflects headwinds in our public safety business of about 1.5 points and a reduction of international volumes in tactical radios and in integrated vision. Segment operating margin is anticipated to be about 23.75% that's up 100 basis points relative to the prior midpoint reflecting increased cost and integration benefits. And finally in Aviation Systems we're forecasting an organic revenue decline of 1% to 5% year-over-year primarily from the factors I noted earlier in commercial aerospace. This points to reported revenues of approximately $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion for the year post divestitures. On the commercial side, revenues are set to be down around 35% organically for the year and for government related businesses which include mission networks, military training and defense aviation products, they are expected to be up in the mid to high single digits. Segment operating margins are expected to be approximately 13.25% down versus the prior guide by 75 basis points from the midpoint, due primarily to fixed cost absorption from the volume declines partially offset by cost actions. The margin guide also accounts for the airport security and automation divestiture we closed yesterday. So to summarize and put it all together, overall pullback in our outlook, but one with a pandemic related impacts have been nearly offset by management actions with the remainder being the result of a more flexible approach to capital deployment in this environment. With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions. Sure, Carter. Let me start with the free cash flow, as we mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, we have the benefit of the progress payments going from 80% to 90%. That an excess of around $100 million that's being slowed down to the suppliers, and so net-net that's a very little impact. There is a benefit and stimulus related to taxes, which is helping us offset some of the other impacts across the business. But when you take a look at net income, that is moving, but as I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well, we've largely offset that. And so, with the benefit of the stimulus efforts, we're just holding that as a placeholder. We may have to go deeper into supplier payments. We may have to think about our pension contributions and things like that. But for the most part, we've held the working capital intact after three days. Net income is a little bit lower. We're getting benefits from the stimulus efforts and we're just kind of holding that as a placeholder for other things for later in the year. Yes. We're making really good progress here Doug. Look we did move forward the $500 million, $300 million net, which we had expected in calendar 2022 to calendar 2021. So we're not going to be done at the end of 2021. We're going to continue working this into 2022, and will become part of normal operations. So we do expect that the ultimate synergy value coming out of this merger is going to be beyond the $500 million and $300 million we've talked about previously because we're seeing it already it's coming forward and it's likely to go up. So we had $65 million in a stub year, we start out of the gauge very, very quickly. I wouldn't say it was conservatism coming into this year, but we were still a fairly new company. There were a lot of moving parts in the year. We guided to an incremental $115 million in net synergies earlier this year that's getting quite a bit better, more visibility that we're seeing right now in indirect spend. We've seen the consolidation of all of our benefits programs now being completely implemented. All of the CHQ and segment consolidations are now essentially done. We're just seeing just better progress. So is there any impact from COVID it is probably on the fringes there are going to be some issues that we might have that are already embedded in these numbers that we're talking about here, Doug. Some of the opportunities are really supply chain related they may slip out a little bit, but we feel very good about the trajectory we happen to be on. We've got a very seasoned integration team people that know how to work and drive their jobs in and are doing a great job remotely. So we feel good about this. And if anything we have maybe a little more opportunity in the year as opposed to risk. It's probably somewhere a mix between the two. It's been kind of back end loaded over the past number of years I would say in 2019, even 2019 was a little bit more level loaded. This year you know $533 million is a pretty consistent with what we did for the two companies combined last year. And so our goal is to make it more linear throughout the year, but I think there is some natural level of linearity in there we're probably be still a little bit more back end loaded there. So yes it'll still probably stay a little back end loaded, but again a lot better than it's been historically in 2019 I think was started that. Well, look, I mean, for - at the moment Jon I mean, our overall philosophy on capital deployment really hasn't changed. We're going to drive and generate substantial free cash. We're going to pay an attractive dividend that has a payout ratio in the 30% to 35% range; we saw back in February raised a dividend by 13%, 10% back in August last year. So we'll continue to be committed to paying an attractive dividend. We don't have our leverage ratio as Jay pointed out is pretty attractive. Anything debt that's coming due will likely be refinanced, so that will be a pull on cash. We don't see pension contributions for probably another year or two depending upon what happens in rates and returns this year. So it does leave a lot of capacity for deployment. And at the moment, we're still committed to returning that to shareholders in the form of repurchases. I have mentioned in my remarks for the year we're going to be a $1.7 billion. So we'll return the $1 billion in proceeds from selling SDS. Beyond that we'll pause it, but then you have a tremendous amount of capacity back into the year a lot of the liquidity and I see the sort of normalizing as we get into calendar 2021. About $0.10 in that $0.28, there is a lot of moving parts in there. But the pension is incremental about $25 million."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to L3Harris Technologies Fourth Quarter Calendar Year 2021 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. . As a reminder, this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today are Chris Kubasik, our CEO; and Michelle Turner, our CFO. First, a few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our press release, presentation and SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. In addition, following our 8-K filed earlier in the month, we'll be speaking to our 2021 results and our prior 4 segment structure, and our 2022 outlook will be in our realigned 3 segment structure that also shifts pension items to the corporate level, furthering operational transparency. With that, Chris, over to you.\nChristopher Kubasik: Okay. Thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome Michelle Turner to this morning's call. She is an experienced financial executive with diverse operational experience, including 2 decades in the aerospace and defense industry. She joins us from Johnson & Johnson. She was the CFO of their supply chain organization. I'm excited to have Michelle on the team and look forward to our partnership. So welcome to week 2, Michelle.\nMichelle Turner: Thanks, Chris. It's great to be back in the defense industry and to be part of the L3Harris team. I've been following the merger, and I'm excited about leveraging my experiences to further our strategy of being a non-traditional prime.\nChristopher Kubasik: Okay. Let's get started. This morning, we reported our 2021 earnings, and I'm pleased with the result. Our company delivered another solid year of bottom line performance, growing EPS and free cash flow per share by 12% and 9%, respectively. It wasn't, however, without its challenges as the pandemic stressed our supply chain at a time when budgets remain uncertain. Organic revenues were up 2% for the year, and our margin performance was exceptional as merger cost synergies, alongside E3 savings, enabled expansion of 110 basis points. Looking ahead to this year, we initiated guidance today that reflects current market conditions. Organic revenues are to be up 1% to 3% with steady to rising segment margins. And when combined with the share count decline, we expect EPS of $13.35 to $13.65, reflecting another solid year of growth. Our free cash flow guide of $2.15 billion to $2.25 billion incorporates current tax regulations, which requires us to capitalize R&D expenditures beginning in 2022 versus the prior practice of annual deductions resulting in tax cash payment increases. Excluding this impact, free cash flow per share growth would have been up by double digits. We'll provide more details on these figures later on the call. Our focus on both value creation and advancing our strategy of leading as a non-traditional prime has driven our success to date. Moreover, in recent months, we made progress in our focus areas of growing the top line, strengthening our operations and augmenting our disciplined allocation of capital. Let's start with the top line. With the integration of the company largely behind us, we're progressing on our efforts to grow the business through a 3-pronged approach: first, investing in our capabilities; second, bidding, winning and priming more programs; and finally, expanding our international presence. Our award activity throughout the year demonstrated traction against all 3 of these efforts across all domains. As a leading defense technology company, we're maintaining our industry-leading R&D spend as a percentage of revenues, with an emphasis on open architecture, multifunction, and software-defined solutions across our broad portfolio of capabilities. This remains instrumental in expanding our revenue synergy pipeline as we reached a cumulative 1 billion in funded orders, including a contract for a classified next-generation system in the fourth quarter. We are also accelerating momentum with internal investments in the maritime and cyber domains. Our leading sensor and integration capabilities for naval solutions on programs, such as the Columbia and Virginia class submarines, led to awards of several hundred million 2021. In addition, we received $100 million sole-source IDIQ from the U.S. Navy for cyber hardened electronic attack shipboard systems in the quarter. Our capabilities position us for multibillion dollar opportunities across ship classes and geographies that we're pursuing in 2022 and beyond. We also expanded our external investments to broaden overall offerings in various capability sets. We're making calculated investments in partnerships and companies so we can bring unique technological solutions to global defense customers. There will be more on this topic throughout the year. Next, let me update you on the progress we've made as a non-traditional prime, what we call being a trusted disruptor. Our positioning at the nexus of traditional defense players and new experimental commercial entrants aligns well with the U.S. government's desire for agile, advanced and affordable solutions to address near-peer threats. We expect budget dollars to continue gravitating in this direction. A notable example is within the space domain and the need for responsive satellites that can be rapidly procured and deployed to address a range of threats. We were awarded over $0.5 billion in responsive satellite contracts as a prime in 2021, including a $200 million award for a classified mission within the Intel Community in the fourth quarter and we have considerable and exciting opportunities ahead of us. Turning to International. We continue to see demand for our defensive solutions that are aligned with U.S. export policies and insure partner security. And with a book-to-bill of 1.1 on solid revenue growth in 2021, our strategy is solid. We had a strong growth in our ISR aircraft missionization business from a key NATO customer with awards of over $600 million, including $70 million in the fourth quarter, which is part of a broader multibillion dollar opportunity set we're pursuing in 2022 and beyond. In addition, our international Tactical Communications business continued to experience robust order activity for land modernization in the UK, Australia and a Mid-East country that totaled approximately 500 million for the year and over 200 million in the quarter. This pairs well with the expanding DoD modernization goals, supporting multiyear growth potential for our business. In fact, just last week, we were awarded a $750 million IDIQ by the U.S. Marines to manufacture the Falcon IV multichannel handheld radio that meets modern crypto security standards, while providing them resilient networking capabilities. Overall, I'm pleased with the tangible progress we made in 2021 as we delivered a funded book-to-bill above 1.0 and grew our organic backlog by 5%. Let's pivot to operations. Our integration efforts were quite successful and will wrap up in early 2022. We also continue to drive a performance culture through our E3 program, that pervades the organization and has been key in mitigating the unforeseen challenges related to the pandemic. We talk about the key components of our E3 program, factory optimization, engineering excellence, supply chain and overhead management. In 2022, we expect these factors to at least offset predicted inflationary pressures for both labor and materials, which we'll look to improve upon as the year progresses. We're off to a good start with our segment and business consolidation efforts. And over the last 2 quarters, we've delivered margins at or above 19% on a consolidated basis or approximately 16% on a segment basis using our new reporting structure. We've also reached several key operational milestones this quarter. Within Space, we successfully completed critical design reviews for 2 major responsive satellite programs. First, the Space Development Agency's Tracking Layer; and second, the Missile Defense Agency's Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor, known as HBTSS. We are gearing up for prototype launches of 5 satellites over the next 2 years. Within our ISR business, we completed a key flight test and received a supplemental type certificate for the first Compass Call crossdeck aircraft, the U.S. Air Force's missionized business jet. This strategic aircraft arrived in our Waco, Texas facility in the fourth quarter, where we began the next phase of modification. It is scheduled for delivery to the customer later this year. Lastly, our WESCAM product line within our electro optical business concluded its transition to a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and delivered a record high number of turrets in the fourth quarter as well as for the year. Concerning our supply chain, the environment continues to be fluid. For 2022, we expect supply chain disruptions to continue into the first half. As a result, our team is set to continue utilizing the various tools we outlined to address the challenges, such as engaging with lower tiers of the supply chain, accelerating our purchase commitments, utilizing  designations and leveraging smart inventory in selected areas. Shifting to capital allocation. Our focus remains on maximizing cash generation and strengthening our portfolio, while sustaining a shareholder-friendly approach. Growth in free cash flow per share is a key metric for us. This will remain a 2022 focus as we drive our profit growth, reduce working capital days, continue tax planning and manage capital expenditures. When combined with our share repurchases in 2021 and our current target of $1.5 billion of repurchases this year, we expect free cash flow per share growth of 10%, assuming the R&D tax credit is repealed, contributing to double-digit annual growth since the merger. Regarding the dividend, it remains part of our balanced capital allocation framework with opportunities to grow it further as we've done in prior years. Finally, with respect to M&A, we'll be opportunistic and use our balance sheet capacity judiciously to complement our capital return program. Let me now provide details on our 2021 results and the consolidated guidance for 2022, and I'll ask Michelle to fill in the segment and other details on the outcome. So let's start on Slide 4. I'll refer to all 2021 figures in our prior 4 segment structure given our realignment became effective in early 2022. Fourth quarter organic revenue was down 1% versus the prior year. CS and AS were down 11% and 5%, respectively, with electronic component shortages in its supply chain, weighing down the tactical business at CS, while AS was impacted by the timing of awards. IMS saw solid 6% growth from continued ISR aircraft missionization activity and the SAS segment was up 2%, driven by growth in our responsive space franchise. Margins expanded 70 basis points to 19.2%, with the most notable drivers being E3 performance and integration benefits, which offset volume-related supply chain headwinds. We exceeded our internal outlook by 100 basis points through favorable mix related to award timing, continued strong E3 performance and by containing supply chain impacts. These drivers, along with our share repurchase activity, drove EPS up 5% to $3.30 as shown on Slide 5. For the full year, organic revenue was up 2% and in line with our prior guidance at the consolidated level. At the segment level, IMS and SAS were up 5% and 3%, respectively, while CS and AS were down in low single digits. CS would have been up in low single digits, excluding these supply chain impacts. Margins expanded 110 basis points to 19.1%, exceeding our prior guidance of approximately 18.75% and we're more than 75 basis points ahead of our midpoint at our initial guide with E3 performance and integration benefits being the primary drivers. Earnings per share grew 12% or $1.35, primarily from operations, synergy benefits and a 6% lower share count that overcame divestiture and supply chain headwinds, enabling us to deliver double-digit EPS for another year. Our full year free cash flow came in just below the bottom end of our prior guidance range as we consciously built inventory levels to reduce supply chain risk. With this cash flow, along with proceeds from divestitures, we repurchased $3.7 billion in stock and paid over $800 million in dividends, returning about 10% of our market cap to our shareholders. Next, on Slides 6 through 9, we provide details on segment results, which are largely consistent with prior commentary. In the interest of time, we can take questions in a few minutes so that we can shift our discussion to the 2022 guide. Starting with the top line. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $17.3 billion to $17.7 billion, implying organic growth of 1% to 3% and reflecting growth in every segment. We expect a weaker first half down in the mid-single digits, driven by continued global supply chain impacts in our product-heavy businesses at CS, along with international ISR aircraft award timing IMS given tough compares. We expect high single-digit growth coming in the second half of 2022. Segment operating margins are expected to be 16% to 16.25%, positioning us for another year of expansion and are expected to follow sales with more profit in the second half of the year. This, combined with a 4% lower share count, will result in 2022 EPS of $13.50 at the midpoint. On free cash flow, our $2.15 billion to $2.25 billion guide includes a $600 million to $700 million headwind from the R&D tax policy. So with that, I'll turn it over to Michelle.\nMichelle Turner: Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I look forward to my engagement with the analyst and investor community at upcoming events and conferences. I'll continue now on Slide 10 with our 2022 segment details and our realigned 3 segment structure as well as provide additional color on the 2022 EPS bridge and cash flow. Integrated Mission Systems revenue is expected to be $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, up 2% to 4% driven by maritime expansion, classified growth in defense aviation and continued recovery in our commercial aerospace business. ISR aircraft timing from a tough compare is expected to drive a low to mid-single-digit decline in the first half with high single-digit growth coming in the back half of the year. Segment operating margins are anticipated to be within a range of 13.5% to 13.75%, with E3 program savings more than offsetting program mix impacts. In Space & Airborne Systems, we expect revenue of $6 billion to $6.1 billion or flat to up 2%, driven by our traction and responsive space, along with classified strengths in Intel & Cyber, which will be moderated by continued pressure in our airborne businesses as we transition to modernization over the coming years. Segment operating margins are expected to be within a range of 12.5% to 12.75% as E3 program savings offset mix headwinds from key growth programs within space. Communication Systems revenue is expected to be $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion or up 2% to 4% from modernization demand in Tactical Communications, with supply chain delays netting an expected mid-teen decline in the first half and strong double-digit growth in the back half of the year, along with recovering sales in Public Safety. Growth will be moderated by a flattish outlook in broadband and integrated vision solutions. Segment operating margins are anticipated to be within a range of 24.25% to 24.50% as our E3 program savings will more than offset inflationary pressures within Tactical Communications. Now turning to the EPS bridge on Slide 11. As Chris said, we expect full year EPS of $13.50 at the midpoint. Of this increase, operations will contribute $0.62, along with a lower share count for $0.60, overcoming headwinds from divested earnings and residual supply chain impacts as well as lower pension income and other items of $0.05. On cash flow, our outlook reflects a modest working capital improvement, $330 million in capital expenditures and no pension funding. We expect to deploy roughly 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through $1.5 billion in buybacks, barring any strategic M&A. With that, I'll turn it back over to you, Chris.\nChristopher Kubasik: All right. Thanks, Michelle. Well done. So to sum it up, 2021 performance demonstrated our ability to deliver strong bottom line results in a dynamic environment, with our 2022 outlook reflecting growth in all key metrics. With that, Rob, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: . And our first question is from David Strauss with Barclays.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And welcome, Michelle.\nMichelle Turner: Good morning.\nDavid Strauss: Chris, could you maybe touch on the budget outlook, what you saw in the fiscal '22 authorization markup. And if that becomes approach, what that might mean for you guys? And as well as what you're assuming in terms of CR? And then last one, a little bit more detail on the individual buckets within SAS in terms of what you're expecting for each of the individual businesses relative to that flat to up 2% for the overall business?\nChristopher Kubasik: Thanks, Dave. Let me start with the CR, the continuing resolution. We're assuming a half year CR. Meaning, by April 1, we'll move forward. And I just look at the fact that the President State of the Union speech moved to March. So I'm assuming he wants to have a budget at that point in time. So that's what we factored in. Obviously, I think like others, it is a full year CR, will provide a couple of hundred millions of top line headwind, which is not unexpected. Relative to the budget, I think we were all pleased to see the markup. I think that could be a good foreshadowing of the future. We don't have a fight up yet, but we continue to think aspirationally that mid-single-digit growth is something that we can achieve. As I've said before, I really like our portfolio, the fact that we're in all these domains. And as I laid out in my prepared comments, we continue to invest hired to grow. We're working with some of these new commercial entrants. We're priming and bidding more, and international has been a good story. So that's how I see the budget rolling out. Look forward to more information there. When go to SAS, the components of SAS, there's focus on the key sectors. We see -- continue to see space growing in the mid-single digits. We were probably a little more bullish back in October, but there continue to be delays in contract awards, either directly or indirectly related to the CR. So Space, I see mid-single digit this year, Intel & Cyber is one of our hot businesses, continuing to grow high single digits. So that's maybe a little better than what we had told you in October. Mission Networks, which we moved from AS into SAS as we collapsed the segment, has been and always continues to be in that low single-digit growth, mainly doing work for the FAA. But what we're seeing the decline is in our air sectors, Mission Avionics and EW combined. And that's really almost entirely tied to the F-35 program. As you know, the TR3 development is rolling off and production is ramping up. So as I quantify it, I think I've said before that 2022, we're going to have about $150 million decline in revenue just attributed to the F-35 program. We'll see that start to return to growth in '23. But this is just a roll-off of development on TR3 and then moving into production on the 3 components that we provide to that aircraft.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.\nPeter Arment : Welcome, Michelle. Chris, maybe you had $0.18 at least baked into your '22 guidance for the supply chain adjustment, and that's obviously better than the $0.29 in '21. So maybe just your confidence around the supply chain? And what kind of visibility, what's baked into the $0.18? And then just also, Michelle made a comment about just modest working capital improvement. Maybe you could just discuss a little bit what's behind that?\nChristopher Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, Peter. No, relative to the supply chain, we think we're doing a pretty good job over the last maybe 6 or 9 months, as I mentioned, with getting more visibility into the second, third tier supply chain. We've invested in tools that give us that visibility. So we've talked previously about a $200 million revenue headwind in '21. We see that continuing in the first half of 2022. And I think where we've been maybe a little more conservative than in October as we see that recovery bouncing back in the second half of '22 and then also in early '23. So think of that about a $100 million headwind each quarter in 1 and 2, and then maybe getting 100 back in the second half and 100 back in early '23 from a revenue. And of course, that brings along the related operating income. So that's how we see it. But it's a dynamic area. It's mainly been focused on electronic components. But we're monitoring it and managing it at all sectors and all segments. And it feels like we've turned the corner, but we'll keep you up to date kind of quarter-to-quarter as things change. So relative to working capital, as we try to get to the guidance, we ended the year at 52 working capital days. We'll bring that down a couple of days as we go to that $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion guide. Michelle?\nMichelle Turner: Yes. And just to add a little bit more color on the working capital. If you think about it, we built smart inventory at the end of 2021. And so we expect Tactical Communications comes back in the second half. We'll leave some of that down. And then there's also an advantage from an ISR perspective on advanced payments that we're anticipating at the end of the year as well. So it's going to help free cash flow within 2022.\nChristopher Kubasik: And I'll just throw in, Peter, just our definition of supply chain is pretty broad. We're throwing into labor, we're throwing in material and we're throwing in inflation. So all that contributes to the $0.18.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.\nDouglas Harned: In Communication Systems, there you've clearly been hit by around COVID, supply chain, we've also got inflation, that would be hitting fixed price -- commercial fixed price contracts there. If you were to think of 2022 without these headwinds having been there, what would you see Communication Systems looking like in terms of growth margin? And is this something, given that it's -- there's been -- there's a headwind there, is this something that we should see all coming back when we move out to 2023? Or is there just going to be some lost demand and margin here?\nChristopher Kubasik : Yes. Doug, that's a great question. Something we spend a lot of time looking at. I don't see any loss. I think this is just a timing issue. And as we were looking through the business, just the other day, I mean it's had a great book-to-bill in 2021. Now some of that is due to less revenue, but we have a record backlog, an all-time high in backlog, which is an indication that we continue to win new business. And I mentioned just the marines recently, which is a winner-take-all competition. So we're very excited to have won that $750 million IDIQ. And throughout '21, I think we were pretty clear in all the head-to-head competitions we won the majority share. So the demand is there. The modernization is happening that's in our backlog. And everything indicates quite -- to be doing quite well. What we would have had without supply chain risks probably would have been 300 basis points or 400 basis points more growth as these things slip into '22. And as I mentioned, potentially '23, depending on how the supply chain plays out. So at a high level, that's kind of how I see tactical. You asked about Communications Systems in totality. So the PSPC business, a lot of that is tied to state and local municipalities. As we said, that ought to rebound as the budgets get back in place. And we had some key wins last year, but we expect that to continue to grow. BCS, our Broadband Communication Systems in Salt Lake. A lot of that is still tied to the next-gen jammer start-up and some new opportunities that they're pursuing. So we feel pretty good about our communications. I've got, for the full year '22, Tactical up mid-single digits, maybe even a little better. BCS and IBS are kind of flattish area and PSPC should bounce back with the budget improvement. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi, Chris, and welcome, Michelle. Maybe I wanted to bridge that growth from 2022, the 1 to 3. Chris, you've talked about it in a bunch of moving pieces, some of the CS softness, Airborne and F-35, you mentioned versus the mid-single-digit growth profile you have. And then maybe just a follow-up on the SAS growth, perhaps being softer. What are you seeing there in terms of trends longer term?\nChristopher Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, Sheila. We had said in October that would be in the lower to mid-single digits, which best I can tell everybody is interpreting is 2 to 4 and now we're at 1 to 3. So it's a it's a close call there. And again, I'm the accountable exec here for given the guidance with Michelle and my team. But I really tried to look at the current market conditions. Everything I see from not having a budget, at CR and supply chain risk, it seems appropriate to guide. So I don't see this as a major change from 90 days ago, but I'm trying to give you the visibility.  I mean, basically, the only thing that really changed -- and I know it gets a little complicated as we went from 4 segments to 3, but we can talk about that later. But we filed more than enough documents with the SEC and our  trying to bridge it. But IMS and CS basically did not change from October. Those were kind of in the 2% to 4% range. As I said, the big changes in SAS, we can argue how big a change that was. But clearly, downward pressure on the top line. And as I mentioned in an earlier comment or response, most of that is driven by the air domain and F-35 specifically. The good news is that's a well-known program that everybody has visibility into. So we have confidence that as we negotiate lots 16 and 17, prepare for the cut in of our technology on Lot 15, that there's a lot of certainty and predictability in our revenue stream. So we do see '23, '24, '25 coming back. Longer term, just within SAS, I mean I really like what we're doing in the Space business, both on the satellites and the ground vehicles -- or the ground stations. We pretty much control our own destiny. You've heard us talk about the missile defense area, and we'll be launching 5 prototypes in the next 2 years. And then I think there'll be further opportunities to down-select from 2 to 1. And if we perform and have success, there could be billions of dollars of opportunities. So I really like where we are in Space with the response of SAS. We still work with a lot of our industry partners, providing them payloads for the exquisite sat. So -- and we've been successful in winning a lot of ground station. So I'm excited about the space. Intel & Cyber continues to grow. That's an international business doing work with the 5 ICE countries. It's probably the hottest market we have. And again, I think long term, there's going to be more and more mission networks. We have a competition, a recompete, coming up for the FAA and hopefully sometime this year, but that continues to be a good business and solid and steady. And then it's really all about air and the F-35 program, the EW capabilities for the F-16. Internationally, we're on the B-52, and that's a complete overhaul relative to EW capabilities. And then we think we're well positioned on next-gen aircraft, but all that is classified as you know, and more to come is that those decisions and down selects are made. So longer term, SAS, just like the other 2 segments, should be able to grow. And that's our plan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.\nRobert Stallard: Chris, you commented about -- so you had a good year on the export side in 2021. I was wondering what your expectations are for 2022? Whether these are various tensions around the world, particularly in Eastern Europe could have some benefits for orders?\nChristopher Kubasik : Yes. No, Robert, good point. I mean for the last couple of years, our international business has been growing double digit. And I think our strategy, which is somewhat unique, I think, compared to others. We have focused countries, 10 focus countries, where we have executives full time in the countries. And then we use our distributors and reps more for the product. So it seems to be paying off, and we've been able to see that grow. I mean beyond '22 and beyond, we're seeing mid-single-digit growth. But as you said, anything can change rather quickly, especially in the European area. So our Tactical Communications business is generally a quick turn business, and I think could be pretty opportunistic as well as our Night Vision business. So we're always available for quick turns when tensions get tight or there's new demand or requests. So I think there could be some potential growth upside that we haven't completely factored in. And again, a lot of our products that I alluded to are more on the defensive side. So ISR situational awareness has always been key. We've migrated to the biz jets and we've talked about the success of that strategy and programs in NATO and the Mid-East. And again, we have multiple other countries we're working with over the next few years. And then we also, being somewhat -- I hate to say, platform agnostic, but we're working with different parts of the world. We have King Air ISR capabilities. We have large aircraft and bizjets. So they're all working reasonably well. We'll let you know as things move forward in the international world, but optimistic for 2022.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Maugeri with Wolfe Research.\nMichael Maugeri: Following on Peter's question from earlier, sort of taking a step from the '22 free cash guide out of a year. Is $3 billion or better what we should be looking at for 2023? And then is free cash growth in 2023 all earnings growth? Or where, if we can, should we expect to see you to continue to generate working capital efficiency out in '23?\nChristopher Kubasik : Yes. Thanks, Mike. Let me take that in reverse order. We absolutely expect to continue to see working cap improvement. We've talked aspirationally of getting down to the low 40s. We ended the year at 52 for 2021, 52 working capital days. We should be able to take out a few more days in '22, which still gives us a long runway for '23 and beyond. So notwithstanding the R&D item, which everybody is confident will be repealed or deferred for 4 years, but haven't happened yet. So we figured we'd just give guidance, give you the pieces. But we've effectively kind of guided to a 2.8 to 2.9 for 2022, if you use the midpoint of the R&D 600 to 700. So that should put us on track to get close or around the $3 billion mark in 2023. Starting with top line growth, which will generate more OI in earnings. And then, of course, the working capital. I tried to look at maybe implied in your question, if we go back a couple of years or 2.5 years, we talked about getting to $3 billion in 2022. And obviously, coming up short. Just thought I'd hit that head on. I mean, clearly, we talked about some of the supply chain decisions we've made, which was a little bit of a headwind. At that time, we didn't know there'd be a stimulus bill that's affected social security payments. So many of us defer those payments back in 2020 for the rules, and now we're paying them back. So we have almost $100 million of social security payments that we have to pay in 2022 that's in our guidance. And we divested more businesses than we had initially modeled. So I continue to like to look at free cash flow per share. I went back to day 1. And while we don't really disclose or publish it, we had a plan of $14.50 on free cash flow 2.5 years ago in 2022. If you do the math today, I'll do it for you, we're at $14.80. So on our free cash flow per share, we're ahead of where we were kind of be 2.5 years ago, even though we're coming up short on the $3 billion. So hopefully, that might make sense and gave you all the answers to your question.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global.\nRichard Safran : Michelle, welcome to the call. Once again, you're highlighting E3 as a tailwind in '22. I was curious as to how much runway you think you have left with respect to A3 cost savings? You've been reporting the E3's benefit to margins for quite some time. And I was just curious if you think longer term, you have continued room for meaningful improvement? In your answer, if you could get a bit more specific about where you think the additional benefit comes from?\nChristopher Kubasik : Thanks. Great question. And the answer is obviously going to be yes. I think the system and the methodology we've put in place has been a success, and we expect it to continue. I mean to give you some -- historically, I think a lot of these continuous improvement programs start out focused on the supply chain, which is a good thing in direct labor optimization, and we do that. But we've taken a much broader approach, and one area is just the ability to improve our yield. So we're looking at our rolled throughput yield at all of our facilities. They come in different sizes and different flavors. But if we can obviously improve those, yields 5 basis points or 10 basis points, it just contributes to the bottom line.  This year, we collapsed from 4 segments to 3. That brought us savings, any savings I get, I put under the E3 umbrella. But that brings about some savings. When we first merged, we had 19 sectors rolling up to these 4 segments. Today, we're down to 14. We might have sold 1 or 2. We collapsed a couple more. So we're getting synergies in the organizational structure. With the -- we've been investing in systems. We're putting in a manufacturing execution system in one of our large facilities that have a lot of manual and paper processes. Those are now getting updated, and everything is getting to be electronic. So I think that is already starting to show benefits, and the system is not even fully implemented yet. And we'll roll that out to other facilities and factories. We have a process that we call our perimeter cost, where we look at the entire cost of each and every facility. And we look where the big bucks are, and we target our E3 projects, of which we have hundreds at those larger dollar items. I mean this comes down to a lot of this links in with our ESG or environmental initiatives and whether it's energy and utilities, all those types of things. I think, are maybe some specific examples. Still try to figure out, as I said, and I think everyone said, if we return to -- and do things the way we used to pre-COVID, we've missed an opportunity. So I think I've told you -- before the merger, 98% of the workforce came to work every day, and that was kind of the norm. And today, we're at about 70%, full-time on-site about 20% hybrid, 10% remote. So that also brings different savings and facilities and such. So we're looking at all those things, Rich.  To be specific on E3 -- but in a broader sense, I think implied in your question was the overall segment growth. So not within E3 is the recovery of the supply chain, more international sales at higher margins, as an example. I mentioned F-35 transitioning out of development into production. I think we all expect higher production margins and development margins. And we still have a little commercial business with the aviation and PSPC and as those turn around. So when I look at all these things, it's hard not to see where we can continue to grow margins for the foreseeable future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen.\nGautam Khanna : Hey, Chris, and welcome, Michelle. Wanted to just ask about capital allocation. So you've done a lot of divestments. Obviously, you're guiding $1.5 billion of buybacks. What's the appetite for M&A? Again, do you see any bigger opportunities presenting themselves? Or do you think it's going to be more of a tuck-in variety?\nChristopher Kubasik : Yes, good question. Well, first of all, the 1.5 of buybacks is directly tied into the free cash flow guide. If the R&D matter gets resolved, that formally increase the free cash flow guide and bring up the buyback to $2 billion, just to be clear on that one. Yes, there's absolutely an appetite for M&A. We have a new leader in our strategy and M&A organization. And we've got a process where we've been looking strategically as to where we might want to make acquisitions. My -- you said big, it's always hard to quantify these adjectives. I mean, having come from L3, I'm probably not a huge fan of lots of little $50 million, $70 million, $100 million deals. It just causes a lot of challenges with integration and such. I think the multibillion, $5 billion and beyond, there aren't many targets, and that's a lot. So I'd say $0.5 billion, $1 billion, $1.5 billion type size to probably call those medium kind of makes sense. So as you know, there are a whole lot of opportunities out there, but we're in discussions proactively and reactively. Nothing on the horizon or foreseeable. I mean, if we make an acquisition in 2022, that would be great. If we don't, we don't. It's not like burning platform, but we're running a disciplined process. We initially started by looking at things strategically. Followed by operationally, if we were to buy it, what are we going to do? How are we going to integrate it? How do we keep the workforce? Do we move people to keep them separate? What are the synergies? I think with the big merger we just did, we have a lot of talent and skills in figuring out revenue and cost synergies. And then financially, working with Michelle, we'll figure out the hurdle rates and the cash returns and the more traditional piece. But that would be the order that goes in. I'll just comment. I think a lot of people have been asking about some of the recent news surrounding Aerojet Rocketdyne, and that decision's impact on the industry. And I know there's different commentary out there, but I'm not familiar with the details of that decision or the rationale, but it seemed to be specific to vertical integration. So relative to what we're thinking about, I don't expect any opposition or hurdles if and when we get to the point where we need to have approvals. And that's something we would consider and evaluate before moving forward. But I think it's business as usual from my perspective, for L3Harris relative to our portfolio, and the things we might consider down the road.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's actually Elizabeth on for Ron this morning. I just wanted to follow on to the last question, I think you hit on a little bit. But given what we've seen in the new administration, do you think in general, the environment for defensive M&A has changed? So you said not for you, but maybe just in general, do you think it's changed? In many ways, do you think big defense M& A is over?\nChristopher Kubasik : Yes. No. Elizabeth, I would think these decisions and policies change administration by administration. So with the current administration, it would appear that, that big M& A, if that was considered big, is potentially over, at least until there's a change in administration at some future point who may or may not have new policies. So as I said, I haven't really looked at and probably won't have the time to figure out what the specific case was. But I think it's always a predisposition for more competition and less vertical integration. And when I look at the L3Harris merger, that went through relatively quickly. It was complementary. We're now in all 5 domains. It made perfect sense. It was just a very small business that did have -- wouldn't allow for competition. So it was divested. So I think you can look at these things pretty quickly and figure out if they're going to go through or not. And I continue to believe that there's -- from our perspective, there will be plenty of opportunities. I think at some point, there's a reluctance to have really big guys get bigger. So I kind of like where I am relative to the real big guys. So that's how I see it from my perspective. We're going to run our playbook and see what happens. And others either will or won't be in the game, but I like where we are.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.\nRobert Spingarn: Welcome, Michelle. Two quick things. Chris, on the talent side, how difficult is it to get people? And what kind of labor inflation are you seeing? And how is that impacting fixed-price contracts? And then, Michelle, just on the tax situation, if you could give us the mechanics? We've been talking about this with everybody for a week. But what are the mechanics of this higher tax rate? Will you pay cash taxes at the higher rate quarterly until you find out what's going to happen and then if you could just clarify that.\nMichelle Turner : Yes. So I'll start from an R&D perspective. And you're right, there has been a lot of fluidity in the calls this week. And so just to reiterate what we have in our guidance. So our free cash flow assumes with the $2.15 billion to $2.25 billion, that assumes $600 million to $700 million related to the R&D tax amortization. And I think it's important to note that this is the tax call that's in effect today, right? So as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And so barring a repeal or deferment, this will have an impact on our results. And so for us, it's about $2 billion over 5 years, and then it goes away. So that will go down to 0. I think to the point about paying it, not paying it, that's certainly something that we're looking at right now. But just to give you a sense of kind of the fluidity you're seeing through the other primes, it really comes down to a couple of different things. One is, clearly, you have everybody understands what they're paying from an IRR perspective. But where the interpretation comes in is around the crowd. And then what you apply to the crowd in terms of overhead and fringe on top of that. And so that's where you're seeing the ranges across each of the different peer companies. And so we're going to work through in terms of what the cash payments will look like, and that's discussions that we're having internally right now. But I think what's more important if we were to take this back to a macro level, it's important that we continue to press on the real issue here, which is we need to get this repealed or we need to get it deferred. It is going to be a huge impact from an overall U.S. competitiveness perspective. And so ensuring that this gets delayed, it is important to continue to drive the innovation that we think about and keeping the U.S. at the cutting edge of innovation.\nChristopher Kubasik : Thanks, Michelle. And Michelle and I have spent a little bit of time with the tax department in her first week. And it's just a world-class organization. And when you look at the metrics, whether it's our effective tax rate relative to others, if you look at our R&D tax credit, which is not what we're talking about now relative to others and the percentages, I think we just got a great organization there and we're seeing that in our financial results.  So going to the talent question, which is a great question. Actually, in 2021, we hired 8,000 new people. And I talked about COVID earlier, and we opened the office and kind of got back to whatever the new norm was in December. And it was interesting because at that time, half of those employees, 4,000, have never even been to a L3Harris facility, with FedEx, on laptops and do everything via Zoom. So talking about a new -- kind of a new world here. But we've hired 8,000. We're probably going to hire another 8,000 this year. We're seeing a little bit of inflation or most of the inflation is at the entry level. We haven't really seen that at the higher levels or the executive levels yet. Maybe that comes later in 2022. But a lot of this depends on geography, and half our workforce seems to be in Florida and Texas. And those seem to be places that people enjoy living and working or moving to. So we've been a little more fortunate maybe just based on the geography. We get about 1,000 new college grads a year. We have a whole process as to how to recruit those through key schools, focused schools. And we've maintained our internship program the last 2 years, even during the pandemic. Unfortunately, those -- we're all remote. But I think I told you back in 2020, we extended offers, we honor those offers. All those things kind of contribute and pay off. And my goal and the team's goal is to have an engaged workforce that's excited to come to work every day and help with our mission. We do periodic engagement surveys to track that. So I think we're doing everything we can. A big believer in flexible work schedules. And we've got a whole variety of ways to have the workforce stay engaged and contribute. But clearly, a watch item. But so far, so good. I mentioned F-35 earlier and some of the challenges that, that program has had. We've been fortunate to have a highly engaged workforce holidays, weekends, over time and been able to maintain that staffing even through the pandemic and meet our milestones. So hopefully, that helps, Robert.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Welcome, Michelle. Chris, I just wanted to go back, I think, to maybe Sheila's question on what really changed in SAS? And maybe even dovetailing in kind of programs that are being impacted by the continuing resolution. But I think you kind of called out the biggest, being the F-35. And it seems like that would have been a known sort of headwind, I guess, in October. So were there any other big specific programmatic changes or programs that you can't start up because of the continuing resolution that are weighing on that kind of growth rate?\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes, good question. No, I mean, the F-35 is a pretty program, right? So we follow the prime -- and as quantities and strategies change relative to what's going to be retrofitted and what's not and such, and I'm talking about all F-35, which we have crypto capabilities. We have displays. We have bomb racks and of course, TR3. So it's a broad portfolio of just under $1 billion of revenue. So it changes on a regular basis. I can assure you. But it's a fair point. We didn't have it at 150 last time we talked. But relative to the CR, it's probably won't be a satisfying question. It's not the fact that I think just the fact that we have a CR has caused the contracting organization and our customers just to defer and delay making awards. So -- which is kind of an indirect impact. I mean there are programs that have been awarded that the follow-on work is limited to the prior year dollars. The new work can't get started. So these aren't getting awarded. And we just see a huge backlog of things that just haven't been awarded. So a lot of these are in the space of the classified arena. And most of the space work is domestic. They don't have a big international footprint as an example. EWs and electronic warfare and mission avionics, again, most of those programs we're supporting an OEM. So we need them to go ahead and get their orders before putting us under contract. So it just feels like a big delay. I think as soon as we get a budget, as soon as there's more certainty, things will kind of open up and then the floodgates will open. But until now, we're probably erring on the side of conservatism. But like I said, based on the current conditions, we're standing by this guidance until things change for the better. And if and when that happens, we'll update you accordingly.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global.\nPeter Skibitski: Chris, I had a quick program question. I was wondering if you could update us on what the Navy and Air Force's plans are to replace the E6Bs, E4Bs? I think that was supposed to be a combined program at one point. I don't know where it is today, but I also know it's kind of right up IMS' alley in potentially a pretty big opportunity. So I was just wondering what your thoughts are on the timing and the sizing of that? And if that's something that DoD can actually fund?\nChristopher Kubasik : Yes. Yes. No, it's right up our alley for the ISR IMS organization. But also those programs, as we do more and more cross-segment work involves BCS and some of the comms team as well. So the one thing I think we're doing a much better job on and what we've been doing since the merger is pulling in other sectors and other segments and looking at some of these things holistically. So yes, IMS will take the lead, but we'll be able to pull through. The E6Bs, I think that's one that we were hoping for last year, and it continues to slide. We'll have to follow up with you with the exact dollar opportunities. It's on our priority of pursuit list to get both of those programs. But I think it's a '22 program. But with all the things that I talked about, it could slip into '23. So -- we'll get you more information on that one, Pete.\nChristopher Kubasik : All right. Well, look, before we sign off, again, I want to welcome Michelle. Obviously, she's hit the ground running. I'd also like to acknowledge the dedication and hard work and perseverance of our 47,000 employees worldwide. We've continued to perform well in a constantly changing environment. They've had to deal with different work schedules, locations, vaccine mandates, all while navigating through a pretty large merger of equals. So -- at the end of the day, we have a great team here at L3Harris. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead as our company enters the third year post merger. Look forward to meeting and talking with everyone over the next few months, introducing Michelle. And then we'll be back in April for our first quarter call. So thank you all for joining. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Christopher Kubasik",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome Michelle Turner to this morning's call. She is an experienced financial executive with diverse operational experience, including 2 decades in the aerospace and defense industry. She joins us from Johnson & Johnson. She was the CFO of their supply chain organization. I'm excited to have Michelle on the team and look forward to our partnership. So welcome to week 2, Michelle. Okay. Let's get started. This morning, we reported our 2021 earnings, and I'm pleased with the result. Our company delivered another solid year of bottom line performance, growing EPS and free cash flow per share by 12% and 9%, respectively. It wasn't, however, without its challenges as the pandemic stressed our supply chain at a time when budgets remain uncertain. Organic revenues were up 2% for the year, and our margin performance was exceptional as merger cost synergies, alongside E3 savings, enabled expansion of 110 basis points. Looking ahead to this year, we initiated guidance today that reflects current market conditions. Organic revenues are to be up 1% to 3% with steady to rising segment margins. And when combined with the share count decline, we expect EPS of $13.35 to $13.65, reflecting another solid year of growth. Our free cash flow guide of $2.15 billion to $2.25 billion incorporates current tax regulations, which requires us to capitalize R&D expenditures beginning in 2022 versus the prior practice of annual deductions resulting in tax cash payment increases. Excluding this impact, free cash flow per share growth would have been up by double digits. We'll provide more details on these figures later on the call. Our focus on both value creation and advancing our strategy of leading as a non-traditional prime has driven our success to date. Moreover, in recent months, we made progress in our focus areas of growing the top line, strengthening our operations and augmenting our disciplined allocation of capital. Let's start with the top line. With the integration of the company largely behind us, we're progressing on our efforts to grow the business through a 3-pronged approach: first, investing in our capabilities; second, bidding, winning and priming more programs; and finally, expanding our international presence. Our award activity throughout the year demonstrated traction against all 3 of these efforts across all domains. As a leading defense technology company, we're maintaining our industry-leading R&D spend as a percentage of revenues, with an emphasis on open architecture, multifunction, and software-defined solutions across our broad portfolio of capabilities. This remains instrumental in expanding our revenue synergy pipeline as we reached a cumulative 1 billion in funded orders, including a contract for a classified next-generation system in the fourth quarter. We are also accelerating momentum with internal investments in the maritime and cyber domains. Our leading sensor and integration capabilities for naval solutions on programs, such as the Columbia and Virginia class submarines, led to awards of several hundred million 2021. In addition, we received $100 million sole-source IDIQ from the U.S. Navy for cyber hardened electronic attack shipboard systems in the quarter. Our capabilities position us for multibillion dollar opportunities across ship classes and geographies that we're pursuing in 2022 and beyond. We also expanded our external investments to broaden overall offerings in various capability sets. We're making calculated investments in partnerships and companies so we can bring unique technological solutions to global defense customers. There will be more on this topic throughout the year. Next, let me update you on the progress we've made as a non-traditional prime, what we call being a trusted disruptor. Our positioning at the nexus of traditional defense players and new experimental commercial entrants aligns well with the U.S. government's desire for agile, advanced and affordable solutions to address near-peer threats. We expect budget dollars to continue gravitating in this direction. A notable example is within the space domain and the need for responsive satellites that can be rapidly procured and deployed to address a range of threats. We were awarded over $0.5 billion in responsive satellite contracts as a prime in 2021, including a $200 million award for a classified mission within the Intel Community in the fourth quarter and we have considerable and exciting opportunities ahead of us. Turning to International. We continue to see demand for our defensive solutions that are aligned with U.S. export policies and insure partner security. And with a book-to-bill of 1.1 on solid revenue growth in 2021, our strategy is solid. We had a strong growth in our ISR aircraft missionization business from a key NATO customer with awards of over $600 million, including $70 million in the fourth quarter, which is part of a broader multibillion dollar opportunity set we're pursuing in 2022 and beyond. In addition, our international Tactical Communications business continued to experience robust order activity for land modernization in the UK, Australia and a Mid-East country that totaled approximately 500 million for the year and over 200 million in the quarter. This pairs well with the expanding DoD modernization goals, supporting multiyear growth potential for our business. In fact, just last week, we were awarded a $750 million IDIQ by the U.S. Marines to manufacture the Falcon IV multichannel handheld radio that meets modern crypto security standards, while providing them resilient networking capabilities. Overall, I'm pleased with the tangible progress we made in 2021 as we delivered a funded book-to-bill above 1.0 and grew our organic backlog by 5%. Let's pivot to operations. Our integration efforts were quite successful and will wrap up in early 2022. We also continue to drive a performance culture through our E3 program, that pervades the organization and has been key in mitigating the unforeseen challenges related to the pandemic. We talk about the key components of our E3 program, factory optimization, engineering excellence, supply chain and overhead management. In 2022, we expect these factors to at least offset predicted inflationary pressures for both labor and materials, which we'll look to improve upon as the year progresses. We're off to a good start with our segment and business consolidation efforts. And over the last 2 quarters, we've delivered margins at or above 19% on a consolidated basis or approximately 16% on a segment basis using our new reporting structure. We've also reached several key operational milestones this quarter. Within Space, we successfully completed critical design reviews for 2 major responsive satellite programs. First, the Space Development Agency's Tracking Layer; and second, the Missile Defense Agency's Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor, known as HBTSS. We are gearing up for prototype launches of 5 satellites over the next 2 years. Within our ISR business, we completed a key flight test and received a supplemental type certificate for the first Compass Call crossdeck aircraft, the U.S. Air Force's missionized business jet. This strategic aircraft arrived in our Waco, Texas facility in the fourth quarter, where we began the next phase of modification. It is scheduled for delivery to the customer later this year. Lastly, our WESCAM product line within our electro optical business concluded its transition to a new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and delivered a record high number of turrets in the fourth quarter as well as for the year. Concerning our supply chain, the environment continues to be fluid. For 2022, we expect supply chain disruptions to continue into the first half. As a result, our team is set to continue utilizing the various tools we outlined to address the challenges, such as engaging with lower tiers of the supply chain, accelerating our purchase commitments, utilizing  designations and leveraging smart inventory in selected areas. Shifting to capital allocation. Our focus remains on maximizing cash generation and strengthening our portfolio, while sustaining a shareholder-friendly approach. Growth in free cash flow per share is a key metric for us. This will remain a 2022 focus as we drive our profit growth, reduce working capital days, continue tax planning and manage capital expenditures. When combined with our share repurchases in 2021 and our current target of $1.5 billion of repurchases this year, we expect free cash flow per share growth of 10%, assuming the R&D tax credit is repealed, contributing to double-digit annual growth since the merger. Regarding the dividend, it remains part of our balanced capital allocation framework with opportunities to grow it further as we've done in prior years. Finally, with respect to M&A, we'll be opportunistic and use our balance sheet capacity judiciously to complement our capital return program. Let me now provide details on our 2021 results and the consolidated guidance for 2022, and I'll ask Michelle to fill in the segment and other details on the outcome. So let's start on Slide 4. I'll refer to all 2021 figures in our prior 4 segment structure given our realignment became effective in early 2022. Fourth quarter organic revenue was down 1% versus the prior year. CS and AS were down 11% and 5%, respectively, with electronic component shortages in its supply chain, weighing down the tactical business at CS, while AS was impacted by the timing of awards. IMS saw solid 6% growth from continued ISR aircraft missionization activity and the SAS segment was up 2%, driven by growth in our responsive space franchise. Margins expanded 70 basis points to 19.2%, with the most notable drivers being E3 performance and integration benefits, which offset volume-related supply chain headwinds. We exceeded our internal outlook by 100 basis points through favorable mix related to award timing, continued strong E3 performance and by containing supply chain impacts. These drivers, along with our share repurchase activity, drove EPS up 5% to $3.30 as shown on Slide 5. For the full year, organic revenue was up 2% and in line with our prior guidance at the consolidated level. At the segment level, IMS and SAS were up 5% and 3%, respectively, while CS and AS were down in low single digits. CS would have been up in low single digits, excluding these supply chain impacts. Margins expanded 110 basis points to 19.1%, exceeding our prior guidance of approximately 18.75% and we're more than 75 basis points ahead of our midpoint at our initial guide with E3 performance and integration benefits being the primary drivers. Earnings per share grew 12% or $1.35, primarily from operations, synergy benefits and a 6% lower share count that overcame divestiture and supply chain headwinds, enabling us to deliver double-digit EPS for another year. Our full year free cash flow came in just below the bottom end of our prior guidance range as we consciously built inventory levels to reduce supply chain risk. With this cash flow, along with proceeds from divestitures, we repurchased $3.7 billion in stock and paid over $800 million in dividends, returning about 10% of our market cap to our shareholders. Next, on Slides 6 through 9, we provide details on segment results, which are largely consistent with prior commentary. In the interest of time, we can take questions in a few minutes so that we can shift our discussion to the 2022 guide. Starting with the top line. Revenue is expected to be in the range of $17.3 billion to $17.7 billion, implying organic growth of 1% to 3% and reflecting growth in every segment. We expect a weaker first half down in the mid-single digits, driven by continued global supply chain impacts in our product-heavy businesses at CS, along with international ISR aircraft award timing IMS given tough compares. We expect high single-digit growth coming in the second half of 2022. Segment operating margins are expected to be 16% to 16.25%, positioning us for another year of expansion and are expected to follow sales with more profit in the second half of the year. This, combined with a 4% lower share count, will result in 2022 EPS of $13.50 at the midpoint. On free cash flow, our $2.15 billion to $2.25 billion guide includes a $600 million to $700 million headwind from the R&D tax policy. So with that, I'll turn it over to Michelle. All right. Thanks, Michelle. Well done. So to sum it up, 2021 performance demonstrated our ability to deliver strong bottom line results in a dynamic environment, with our 2022 outlook reflecting growth in all key metrics. With that, Rob, let's open the line for questions. Thanks, Dave. Let me start with the CR, the continuing resolution. We're assuming a half year CR. Meaning, by April 1, we'll move forward. And I just look at the fact that the President State of the Union speech moved to March. So I'm assuming he wants to have a budget at that point in time. So that's what we factored in. Obviously, I think like others, it is a full year CR, will provide a couple of hundred millions of top line headwind, which is not unexpected. Relative to the budget, I think we were all pleased to see the markup. I think that could be a good foreshadowing of the future. We don't have a fight up yet, but we continue to think aspirationally that mid-single-digit growth is something that we can achieve. As I've said before, I really like our portfolio, the fact that we're in all these domains. And as I laid out in my prepared comments, we continue to invest hired to grow. We're working with some of these new commercial entrants. We're priming and bidding more, and international has been a good story. So that's how I see the budget rolling out. Look forward to more information there. When go to SAS, the components of SAS, there's focus on the key sectors. We see -- continue to see space growing in the mid-single digits. We were probably a little more bullish back in October, but there continue to be delays in contract awards, either directly or indirectly related to the CR. So Space, I see mid-single digit this year, Intel & Cyber is one of our hot businesses, continuing to grow high single digits. So that's maybe a little better than what we had told you in October. Mission Networks, which we moved from AS into SAS as we collapsed the segment, has been and always continues to be in that low single-digit growth, mainly doing work for the FAA. But what we're seeing the decline is in our air sectors, Mission Avionics and EW combined. And that's really almost entirely tied to the F-35 program. As you know, the TR3 development is rolling off and production is ramping up. So as I quantify it, I think I've said before that 2022, we're going to have about $150 million decline in revenue just attributed to the F-35 program. We'll see that start to return to growth in '23. But this is just a roll-off of development on TR3 and then moving into production on the 3 components that we provide to that aircraft. Yes. Thanks, Peter. No, relative to the supply chain, we think we're doing a pretty good job over the last maybe 6 or 9 months, as I mentioned, with getting more visibility into the second, third tier supply chain. We've invested in tools that give us that visibility. So we've talked previously about a $200 million revenue headwind in '21. We see that continuing in the first half of 2022. And I think where we've been maybe a little more conservative than in October as we see that recovery bouncing back in the second half of '22 and then also in early '23. So think of that about a $100 million headwind each quarter in 1 and 2, and then maybe getting 100 back in the second half and 100 back in early '23 from a revenue. And of course, that brings along the related operating income. So that's how we see it. But it's a dynamic area. It's mainly been focused on electronic components. But we're monitoring it and managing it at all sectors and all segments. And it feels like we've turned the corner, but we'll keep you up to date kind of quarter-to-quarter as things change. So relative to working capital, as we try to get to the guidance, we ended the year at 52 working capital days. We'll bring that down a couple of days as we go to that $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion guide. Michelle? And I'll just throw in, Peter, just our definition of supply chain is pretty broad. We're throwing into labor, we're throwing in material and we're throwing in inflation. So all that contributes to the $0.18. Yes. Doug, that's a great question. Something we spend a lot of time looking at. I don't see any loss. I think this is just a timing issue. And as we were looking through the business, just the other day, I mean it's had a great book-to-bill in 2021. Now some of that is due to less revenue, but we have a record backlog, an all-time high in backlog, which is an indication that we continue to win new business. And I mentioned just the marines recently, which is a winner-take-all competition. So we're very excited to have won that $750 million IDIQ. And throughout '21, I think we were pretty clear in all the head-to-head competitions we won the majority share. So the demand is there. The modernization is happening that's in our backlog. And everything indicates quite -- to be doing quite well. What we would have had without supply chain risks probably would have been 300 basis points or 400 basis points more growth as these things slip into '22. And as I mentioned, potentially '23, depending on how the supply chain plays out. So at a high level, that's kind of how I see tactical. You asked about Communications Systems in totality. So the PSPC business, a lot of that is tied to state and local municipalities. As we said, that ought to rebound as the budgets get back in place. And we had some key wins last year, but we expect that to continue to grow. BCS, our Broadband Communication Systems in Salt Lake. A lot of that is still tied to the next-gen jammer start-up and some new opportunities that they're pursuing. So we feel pretty good about our communications. I've got, for the full year '22, Tactical up mid-single digits, maybe even a little better. BCS and IBS are kind of flattish area and PSPC should bounce back with the budget improvement. Operator Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Yes. Thanks, Sheila. We had said in October that would be in the lower to mid-single digits, which best I can tell everybody is interpreting is 2 to 4 and now we're at 1 to 3. So it's a it's a close call there. And again, I'm the accountable exec here for given the guidance with Michelle and my team. But I really tried to look at the current market conditions. Everything I see from not having a budget, at CR and supply chain risk, it seems appropriate to guide. So I don't see this as a major change from 90 days ago, but I'm trying to give you the visibility.  I mean, basically, the only thing that really changed -- and I know it gets a little complicated as we went from 4 segments to 3, but we can talk about that later. But we filed more than enough documents with the SEC and our  trying to bridge it. But IMS and CS basically did not change from October. Those were kind of in the 2% to 4% range. As I said, the big changes in SAS, we can argue how big a change that was. But clearly, downward pressure on the top line. And as I mentioned in an earlier comment or response, most of that is driven by the air domain and F-35 specifically. The good news is that's a well-known program that everybody has visibility into. So we have confidence that as we negotiate lots 16 and 17, prepare for the cut in of our technology on Lot 15, that there's a lot of certainty and predictability in our revenue stream. So we do see '23, '24, '25 coming back. Longer term, just within SAS, I mean I really like what we're doing in the Space business, both on the satellites and the ground vehicles -- or the ground stations. We pretty much control our own destiny. You've heard us talk about the missile defense area, and we'll be launching 5 prototypes in the next 2 years. And then I think there'll be further opportunities to down-select from 2 to 1. And if we perform and have success, there could be billions of dollars of opportunities. So I really like where we are in Space with the response of SAS. We still work with a lot of our industry partners, providing them payloads for the exquisite sat. So -- and we've been successful in winning a lot of ground station. So I'm excited about the space. Intel & Cyber continues to grow. That's an international business doing work with the 5 ICE countries. It's probably the hottest market we have. And again, I think long term, there's going to be more and more mission networks. We have a competition, a recompete, coming up for the FAA and hopefully sometime this year, but that continues to be a good business and solid and steady. And then it's really all about air and the F-35 program, the EW capabilities for the F-16. Internationally, we're on the B-52, and that's a complete overhaul relative to EW capabilities. And then we think we're well positioned on next-gen aircraft, but all that is classified as you know, and more to come is that those decisions and down selects are made. So longer term, SAS, just like the other 2 segments, should be able to grow. And that's our plan. Yes. No, Robert, good point. I mean for the last couple of years, our international business has been growing double digit. And I think our strategy, which is somewhat unique, I think, compared to others. We have focused countries, 10 focus countries, where we have executives full time in the countries. And then we use our distributors and reps more for the product. So it seems to be paying off, and we've been able to see that grow. I mean beyond '22 and beyond, we're seeing mid-single-digit growth. But as you said, anything can change rather quickly, especially in the European area. So our Tactical Communications business is generally a quick turn business, and I think could be pretty opportunistic as well as our Night Vision business. So we're always available for quick turns when tensions get tight or there's new demand or requests. So I think there could be some potential growth upside that we haven't completely factored in. And again, a lot of our products that I alluded to are more on the defensive side. So ISR situational awareness has always been key. We've migrated to the biz jets and we've talked about the success of that strategy and programs in NATO and the Mid-East. And again, we have multiple other countries we're working with over the next few years. And then we also, being somewhat -- I hate to say, platform agnostic, but we're working with different parts of the world. We have King Air ISR capabilities. We have large aircraft and bizjets. So they're all working reasonably well. We'll let you know as things move forward in the international world, but optimistic for 2022. Yes. Thanks, Mike. Let me take that in reverse order. We absolutely expect to continue to see working cap improvement. We've talked aspirationally of getting down to the low 40s. We ended the year at 52 for 2021, 52 working capital days. We should be able to take out a few more days in '22, which still gives us a long runway for '23 and beyond. So notwithstanding the R&D item, which everybody is confident will be repealed or deferred for 4 years, but haven't happened yet. So we figured we'd just give guidance, give you the pieces. But we've effectively kind of guided to a 2.8 to 2.9 for 2022, if you use the midpoint of the R&D 600 to 700. So that should put us on track to get close or around the $3 billion mark in 2023. Starting with top line growth, which will generate more OI in earnings. And then, of course, the working capital. I tried to look at maybe implied in your question, if we go back a couple of years or 2.5 years, we talked about getting to $3 billion in 2022. And obviously, coming up short. Just thought I'd hit that head on. I mean, clearly, we talked about some of the supply chain decisions we've made, which was a little bit of a headwind. At that time, we didn't know there'd be a stimulus bill that's affected social security payments. So many of us defer those payments back in 2020 for the rules, and now we're paying them back. So we have almost $100 million of social security payments that we have to pay in 2022 that's in our guidance. And we divested more businesses than we had initially modeled. So I continue to like to look at free cash flow per share. I went back to day 1. And while we don't really disclose or publish it, we had a plan of $14.50 on free cash flow 2.5 years ago in 2022. If you do the math today, I'll do it for you, we're at $14.80. So on our free cash flow per share, we're ahead of where we were kind of be 2.5 years ago, even though we're coming up short on the $3 billion. So hopefully, that might make sense and gave you all the answers to your question. Thanks. Great question. And the answer is obviously going to be yes. I think the system and the methodology we've put in place has been a success, and we expect it to continue. I mean to give you some -- historically, I think a lot of these continuous improvement programs start out focused on the supply chain, which is a good thing in direct labor optimization, and we do that. But we've taken a much broader approach, and one area is just the ability to improve our yield. So we're looking at our rolled throughput yield at all of our facilities. They come in different sizes and different flavors. But if we can obviously improve those, yields 5 basis points or 10 basis points, it just contributes to the bottom line.  This year, we collapsed from 4 segments to 3. That brought us savings, any savings I get, I put under the E3 umbrella. But that brings about some savings. When we first merged, we had 19 sectors rolling up to these 4 segments. Today, we're down to 14. We might have sold 1 or 2. We collapsed a couple more. So we're getting synergies in the organizational structure. With the -- we've been investing in systems. We're putting in a manufacturing execution system in one of our large facilities that have a lot of manual and paper processes. Those are now getting updated, and everything is getting to be electronic. So I think that is already starting to show benefits, and the system is not even fully implemented yet. And we'll roll that out to other facilities and factories. We have a process that we call our perimeter cost, where we look at the entire cost of each and every facility. And we look where the big bucks are, and we target our E3 projects, of which we have hundreds at those larger dollar items. I mean this comes down to a lot of this links in with our ESG or environmental initiatives and whether it's energy and utilities, all those types of things. I think, are maybe some specific examples. Still try to figure out, as I said, and I think everyone said, if we return to -- and do things the way we used to pre-COVID, we've missed an opportunity. So I think I've told you -- before the merger, 98% of the workforce came to work every day, and that was kind of the norm. And today, we're at about 70%, full-time on-site about 20% hybrid, 10% remote. So that also brings different savings and facilities and such. So we're looking at all those things, Rich.  To be specific on E3 -- but in a broader sense, I think implied in your question was the overall segment growth. So not within E3 is the recovery of the supply chain, more international sales at higher margins, as an example. I mentioned F-35 transitioning out of development into production. I think we all expect higher production margins and development margins. And we still have a little commercial business with the aviation and PSPC and as those turn around. So when I look at all these things, it's hard not to see where we can continue to grow margins for the foreseeable future. Yes, good question. Well, first of all, the 1.5 of buybacks is directly tied into the free cash flow guide. If the R&D matter gets resolved, that formally increase the free cash flow guide and bring up the buyback to $2 billion, just to be clear on that one. Yes, there's absolutely an appetite for M&A. We have a new leader in our strategy and M&A organization. And we've got a process where we've been looking strategically as to where we might want to make acquisitions. My -- you said big, it's always hard to quantify these adjectives. I mean, having come from L3, I'm probably not a huge fan of lots of little $50 million, $70 million, $100 million deals. It just causes a lot of challenges with integration and such. I think the multibillion, $5 billion and beyond, there aren't many targets, and that's a lot. So I'd say $0.5 billion, $1 billion, $1.5 billion type size to probably call those medium kind of makes sense. So as you know, there are a whole lot of opportunities out there, but we're in discussions proactively and reactively. Nothing on the horizon or foreseeable. I mean, if we make an acquisition in 2022, that would be great. If we don't, we don't. It's not like burning platform, but we're running a disciplined process. We initially started by looking at things strategically. Followed by operationally, if we were to buy it, what are we going to do? How are we going to integrate it? How do we keep the workforce? Do we move people to keep them separate? What are the synergies? I think with the big merger we just did, we have a lot of talent and skills in figuring out revenue and cost synergies. And then financially, working with Michelle, we'll figure out the hurdle rates and the cash returns and the more traditional piece. But that would be the order that goes in. I'll just comment. I think a lot of people have been asking about some of the recent news surrounding Aerojet Rocketdyne, and that decision's impact on the industry. And I know there's different commentary out there, but I'm not familiar with the details of that decision or the rationale, but it seemed to be specific to vertical integration. So relative to what we're thinking about, I don't expect any opposition or hurdles if and when we get to the point where we need to have approvals. And that's something we would consider and evaluate before moving forward. But I think it's business as usual from my perspective, for L3Harris relative to our portfolio, and the things we might consider down the road. Yes. No. Elizabeth, I would think these decisions and policies change administration by administration. So with the current administration, it would appear that, that big M& A, if that was considered big, is potentially over, at least until there's a change in administration at some future point who may or may not have new policies. So as I said, I haven't really looked at and probably won't have the time to figure out what the specific case was. But I think it's always a predisposition for more competition and less vertical integration. And when I look at the L3Harris merger, that went through relatively quickly. It was complementary. We're now in all 5 domains. It made perfect sense. It was just a very small business that did have -- wouldn't allow for competition. So it was divested. So I think you can look at these things pretty quickly and figure out if they're going to go through or not. And I continue to believe that there's -- from our perspective, there will be plenty of opportunities. I think at some point, there's a reluctance to have really big guys get bigger. So I kind of like where I am relative to the real big guys. So that's how I see it from my perspective. We're going to run our playbook and see what happens. And others either will or won't be in the game, but I like where we are. Thanks, Michelle. And Michelle and I have spent a little bit of time with the tax department in her first week. And it's just a world-class organization. And when you look at the metrics, whether it's our effective tax rate relative to others, if you look at our R&D tax credit, which is not what we're talking about now relative to others and the percentages, I think we just got a great organization there and we're seeing that in our financial results.  So going to the talent question, which is a great question. Actually, in 2021, we hired 8,000 new people. And I talked about COVID earlier, and we opened the office and kind of got back to whatever the new norm was in December. And it was interesting because at that time, half of those employees, 4,000, have never even been to a L3Harris facility, with FedEx, on laptops and do everything via Zoom. So talking about a new -- kind of a new world here. But we've hired 8,000. We're probably going to hire another 8,000 this year. We're seeing a little bit of inflation or most of the inflation is at the entry level. We haven't really seen that at the higher levels or the executive levels yet. Maybe that comes later in 2022. But a lot of this depends on geography, and half our workforce seems to be in Florida and Texas. And those seem to be places that people enjoy living and working or moving to. So we've been a little more fortunate maybe just based on the geography. We get about 1,000 new college grads a year. We have a whole process as to how to recruit those through key schools, focused schools. And we've maintained our internship program the last 2 years, even during the pandemic. Unfortunately, those -- we're all remote. But I think I told you back in 2020, we extended offers, we honor those offers. All those things kind of contribute and pay off. And my goal and the team's goal is to have an engaged workforce that's excited to come to work every day and help with our mission. We do periodic engagement surveys to track that. So I think we're doing everything we can. A big believer in flexible work schedules. And we've got a whole variety of ways to have the workforce stay engaged and contribute. But clearly, a watch item. But so far, so good. I mentioned F-35 earlier and some of the challenges that, that program has had. We've been fortunate to have a highly engaged workforce holidays, weekends, over time and been able to maintain that staffing even through the pandemic and meet our milestones. So hopefully, that helps, Robert. Yes, good question. No, I mean, the F-35 is a pretty program, right? So we follow the prime -- and as quantities and strategies change relative to what's going to be retrofitted and what's not and such, and I'm talking about all F-35, which we have crypto capabilities. We have displays. We have bomb racks and of course, TR3. So it's a broad portfolio of just under $1 billion of revenue. So it changes on a regular basis. I can assure you. But it's a fair point. We didn't have it at 150 last time we talked. But relative to the CR, it's probably won't be a satisfying question. It's not the fact that I think just the fact that we have a CR has caused the contracting organization and our customers just to defer and delay making awards. So -- which is kind of an indirect impact. I mean there are programs that have been awarded that the follow-on work is limited to the prior year dollars. The new work can't get started. So these aren't getting awarded. And we just see a huge backlog of things that just haven't been awarded. So a lot of these are in the space of the classified arena. And most of the space work is domestic. They don't have a big international footprint as an example. EWs and electronic warfare and mission avionics, again, most of those programs we're supporting an OEM. So we need them to go ahead and get their orders before putting us under contract. So it just feels like a big delay. I think as soon as we get a budget, as soon as there's more certainty, things will kind of open up and then the floodgates will open. But until now, we're probably erring on the side of conservatism. But like I said, based on the current conditions, we're standing by this guidance until things change for the better. And if and when that happens, we'll update you accordingly. Yes. Yes. No, it's right up our alley for the ISR IMS organization. But also those programs, as we do more and more cross-segment work involves BCS and some of the comms team as well. So the one thing I think we're doing a much better job on and what we've been doing since the merger is pulling in other sectors and other segments and looking at some of these things holistically. So yes, IMS will take the lead, but we'll be able to pull through. The E6Bs, I think that's one that we were hoping for last year, and it continues to slide. We'll have to follow up with you with the exact dollar opportunities. It's on our priority of pursuit list to get both of those programs. But I think it's a '22 program. But with all the things that I talked about, it could slip into '23. So -- we'll get you more information on that one, Pete. All right. Well, look, before we sign off, again, I want to welcome Michelle. Obviously, she's hit the ground running. I'd also like to acknowledge the dedication and hard work and perseverance of our 47,000 employees worldwide. We've continued to perform well in a constantly changing environment. They've had to deal with different work schedules, locations, vaccine mandates, all while navigating through a pretty large merger of equals. So -- at the end of the day, we have a great team here at L3Harris. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead as our company enters the third year post merger. Look forward to meeting and talking with everyone over the next few months, introducing Michelle. And then we'll be back in April for our first quarter call. So thank you all for joining. Have a great day."

            "content": "Thanks, Chris. It's great to be back in the defense industry and to be part of the L3Harris team. I've been following the merger, and I'm excited about leveraging my experiences to further our strategy of being a non-traditional prime. Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I look forward to my engagement with the analyst and investor community at upcoming events and conferences. I'll continue now on Slide 10 with our 2022 segment details and our realigned 3 segment structure as well as provide additional color on the 2022 EPS bridge and cash flow. Integrated Mission Systems revenue is expected to be $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, up 2% to 4% driven by maritime expansion, classified growth in defense aviation and continued recovery in our commercial aerospace business. ISR aircraft timing from a tough compare is expected to drive a low to mid-single-digit decline in the first half with high single-digit growth coming in the back half of the year. Segment operating margins are anticipated to be within a range of 13.5% to 13.75%, with E3 program savings more than offsetting program mix impacts. In Space & Airborne Systems, we expect revenue of $6 billion to $6.1 billion or flat to up 2%, driven by our traction and responsive space, along with classified strengths in Intel & Cyber, which will be moderated by continued pressure in our airborne businesses as we transition to modernization over the coming years. Segment operating margins are expected to be within a range of 12.5% to 12.75% as E3 program savings offset mix headwinds from key growth programs within space. Communication Systems revenue is expected to be $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion or up 2% to 4% from modernization demand in Tactical Communications, with supply chain delays netting an expected mid-teen decline in the first half and strong double-digit growth in the back half of the year, along with recovering sales in Public Safety. Growth will be moderated by a flattish outlook in broadband and integrated vision solutions. Segment operating margins are anticipated to be within a range of 24.25% to 24.50% as our E3 program savings will more than offset inflationary pressures within Tactical Communications. Now turning to the EPS bridge on Slide 11. As Chris said, we expect full year EPS of $13.50 at the midpoint. Of this increase, operations will contribute $0.62, along with a lower share count for $0.60, overcoming headwinds from divested earnings and residual supply chain impacts as well as lower pension income and other items of $0.05. On cash flow, our outlook reflects a modest working capital improvement, $330 million in capital expenditures and no pension funding. We expect to deploy roughly 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders through $1.5 billion in buybacks, barring any strategic M&A. With that, I'll turn it back over to you, Chris. Good morning. Yes. And just to add a little bit more color on the working capital. If you think about it, we built smart inventory at the end of 2021. And so we expect Tactical Communications comes back in the second half. We'll leave some of that down. And then there's also an advantage from an ISR perspective on advanced payments that we're anticipating at the end of the year as well. So it's going to help free cash flow within 2022. Yes. So I'll start from an R&D perspective. And you're right, there has been a lot of fluidity in the calls this week. And so just to reiterate what we have in our guidance. So our free cash flow assumes with the $2.15 billion to $2.25 billion, that assumes $600 million to $700 million related to the R&D tax amortization. And I think it's important to note that this is the tax call that's in effect today, right? So as part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And so barring a repeal or deferment, this will have an impact on our results. And so for us, it's about $2 billion over 5 years, and then it goes away. So that will go down to 0. I think to the point about paying it, not paying it, that's certainly something that we're looking at right now. But just to give you a sense of kind of the fluidity you're seeing through the other primes, it really comes down to a couple of different things. One is, clearly, you have everybody understands what they're paying from an IRR perspective. But where the interpretation comes in is around the crowd. And then what you apply to the crowd in terms of overhead and fringe on top of that. And so that's where you're seeing the ranges across each of the different peer companies. And so we're going to work through in terms of what the cash payments will look like, and that's discussions that we're having internally right now. But I think what's more important if we were to take this back to a macro level, it's important that we continue to press on the real issue here, which is we need to get this repealed or we need to get it deferred. It is going to be a huge impact from an overall U.S. competitiveness perspective. And so ensuring that this gets delayed, it is important to continue to drive the innovation that we think about and keeping the U.S. at the cutting edge of innovation."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instruction]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to our Third Quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today are Chris Kubasik, our CEO, and Jay Malave, our CFO. First, a few words on Forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our press release presentation and SEC filings. Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. With that, Chris, I'll turn it over to you.\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Thank you, Rajiv. And good morning, everyone. As you've seen throughout the week, no Company is immune, including L3Harris to global supply chain pressures, a risk we highlighted at the last earnings call. In recent months, shortages of electronic components began adversely impacting our Company at a time when our product is strong. Our updated full-year guidance now accounts for these impacts. We revised our organic revenue growth expectations to approximately 2%, primarily due to delays for these components weighing on the CS segment. [Indiscernible] such delays, we would have comfortably been within our prior 3% to 5% range. Ultimately, this is a timing shift with no anticipated effect on our industry best market position for radios.  And with our broad and diversified portfolio, along with continued execution elsewhere, especially on the margin front we've increased our range on EPS to $12.85 to $13 per share, and still expect to deliver free cash flow per share of around $14, up double-digit on both accounts. Shifting over to the third quarter, following organic revenue growth of 6% in the second quarter, we saw a decline of 1% due to timing associated with supply chain delays at CES and an ISR aircraft awarded IMS. While I'm disappointed by the soft top-line results, I'll note that the order momentum remains strong with a book-to-bill of 1.07 and we delivered record high margins at 19.6%. EPS was $3.21 up 13% versus the prior year with solid free cash flow of 673 million that contributed to shareholder returns of 1.5 billion in the quarter.  Our execution against the Company's strategy priorities have been a key factor and value creation for all stakeholders, In spite of the pandemic. And we make progress in the quarter by advancing top-line opportunities, improving operational performance, wrapping up portfolio shaping, and returning capital to our owners. Starting with the top line, the revenue declined and the quarter fell short of our internal targets, largely due to 2 timing factors. At CES, the global electronic component shortage has led to a supply chain disruption for our product and electronics focused businesses, notably tactical communications. In the third quarter, the impact was nearly a $100 million or approximately 2 points of revenue.  And in the fourth quarter, our expectation is for the backlog of unfilled orders to grow, and all told we foresee a roughly $250 million to $300 million revenue impact for the year, implying another step-down in the fourth quarter. This is the primary driver of our revenue guidance adjustment at CES. Having said that, we do not anticipate any impact to our bookings, nor our win rates, and expect the segment to end the year with a book-to-bill well over one times. In addition, despite the supply chain challenges we faced in Q3 and ongoing headwinds, we were able to meet delivery requirements on all of our key U.S. DoD modernization programs, and are on track to continue to do so in the fourth quarter, including deliveries on the recently awarded HMS full rate production contract with the U.S. Army.  Second, in IMS we had a follow on ISR aircraft order with a NATO customer that booked to late in the quarter, causing revenues to slip to Q4, representing roughly a 2.5 shift between quarters. While the supply chain headwinds is limit upside opportunities to our revenues for this year, I have been pleased with the team's traction against our strategy of delivering end-to-end solutions to global militaries as a trusted disruptor across all domains. And it's reflected in our order activity and operational milestones. Within the space domain on the classified side, we continue to advance our responsive and exquisite satellite business with several earlier-stage awards, both with the intel Community and DoD, which have follow-on opportunities of nearly $2 billion.  And on the unclassified side, following the imager award in Q2, NOAA is progressing on the recapitalization of its geo weather satellite system and awarded us a study contract for a sounder payload as part of a $3 billion opportunity over the next decade. On the operational front, we completed the preliminary design review in the development of the missile tracking satellite prototype for the Space Development Agency, progressing towards a launch over the coming years, and reflecting yet another significant accomplishment for L3Harris. Moving to the air domain, key awards within the quarter spanned both legacy and next-generation aircraft.  On the B52, we received a 10-year $1 billion IDIQ that has the potential to expand our scope on the program to include EW hardware upgrades such as radar warning receivers, building on our existing software sustainment work. In addition on the international front, we were awarded an initial a $100 million contract to provide capabilities on 12 multi-mission aircraft for the UAE with the potential to double these amounts further demonstrating the breadth of our ISR capabilities that range from turbo props to business jets, to large aircraft. And in the land domain, we were awarded several contracts with the U.S. Army to advance its modernization priorities.  Under the army H MS Program, we received over 200 million in awards for the manpack and leader radios, taking a majority share on both products. These are the first full rate production awards out of a multibillion -dollar IDIQ, and represents less than 15% of the acquisition objective, pointing to considerable runway ahead. We also want a majority share on the second program of record for the EM VGV program with $100 million order, setting us up to ramp production on the Army's next-generation field ready cargos. So we were three for three on strategically significant programs in the land domain this quarter. Within the maritime domain, the team continues to progress on the U.S. Navy Constellation Class frigate with follow-on awards for the next chipset of electrical propulsion and navigation systems as part of a several $100 million opportunity for L3Harris.  We're also awaiting decisions on 2 major prime awards over the coming months. One to provide Electro Optical infrared capabilities on a broad range of the U.S. Navy surface combatants and another with an international ally, highlighting our superior undersea censor capabilities. Both would expand our market reach in this domain. Operationally, the team delivered power conversion suite hardware as part of the Virginia Class block 5 upgrade and completed qualifications for a portion of the power distribution system on the Columbian Class, advancing the U.S. Navy's top priority. We also had a key award within our mission networks business.  We leveraged the air traffic management capabilities we provide to the FAA, winning a new international franchise with the Australian government to modernize the nation's air traffic control and surveillance networks. This program is an over $300 million opportunity, and strengthens L3Harris's long-standing relationship with Australia. Finally, we received a strategic award on the revenue synergy front as we signed a $130 million contract with a mid east customer to provide modernized, software-defined radios through a localized joint venture. And this customer channels synergy award opens the door to a long-term opportunity for up to 50,000 radios.  When combined with other orders in the quarter, revenue synergy awards to-date totaled roughly 900 million on a win rate that remains at 70%. For the pipeline of over $7 billion, these synergies will be a notable contributor to our top-line growth. This win supported, another strong quarter for a book-to-bill 1.07 and 1.06 times year-to-date, increasing our organic backlog to $21 billion. We're up 9% from last year and 4% year-to-date. This is validation of our internal investments in leading R&D spend, as well as confirmation of our alignment with government priorities. Shifting over to the outlook for budgets, we're pleased with the progress made on the FY22 defense spending bills that continue to prioritize near-peer threats, notwithstanding another CR.  To plus ups from the HASC, SaaS, and SAC-D along with steadiness from HAC -D, combined with recent global events provide a degree of comfort that we should expect stability in military spending over the coming years. And in my personal discussions with senior leadership of the administration and Congress, I have consistently heard of a growing need for innovative, resilient and affordable solutions which we're focused on providing. All-in-all, as we consider the trajectory of our top-line, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth through our domestic positioning, revenue synergies, and international expansion that stem from a pipeline of opportunities well in excess of a $100 billion.  Pivoting the margin performance our team delivered a stellar quarter at 19.6%, the best post-merger results and an indication of the Company's potential over the next couple of years as we further build a culture of operational excellence. Our performance was the result of delivering another 15 million of incremental cost synergies, and we're well on track to hit our $350 million target. We continue to manage our overhead costs and drive our E3 program to more than offsetting supply chain headwinds. Due primarily to our year-to-date results, we now see margins for 2021 exceeding our prior expectation of 18.5% by 25 basis points. Beyond 2021, our E3 program will remain a key contributor to steady expansion in our operating margins, net of inflationary pressures.  This program is one of our key discriminators. And let me highlight just a couple of examples. First, is factory optimization that represents half of this opportunity set. Through streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing processes, be it from a redesign of a factory's layout or integrating automation tools, we can shorten cycle times, increase labor efficiency and continue to drive out costs. A great example is the pilot program at our Amityville facility in New York, where an augmented reality assembly aid that electronically displays and validates our processes helps reduce cycle time by 25% and higher first-pass yields by several points. And we're in the early stages of a strategy with a 3-year roll out ahead of us. The other half of our opportunity comes from the engineering excellence hand supply chain.  On the former, through the deployment of our digital ecosystem, front-loading our program activities, and enhancing training for our roughly 20,000 engineers and 1,500 program managers, we're able to increase commonality and better manage cost and schedule across the Company. These have been key with some of our standout wins within the Space domain, enabling a foray into missile defense, as well as with driving favorability in our EACs. On supply chain, the global disruption we've highlighted have been largely contained to about 15% of the Company, and are temporary in nature.  The focus we've had, be it on reducing the number of suppliers are leveraging our roughly $7.5 billion spend as an enterprise, remain in place with further opportunities. In the years ahead. Moving over to the portfolio, we put a bow on the post-merger shaping activities in the quarter and closed on the electron devices divestiture for $185 million, while announcing the sale of 2 small businesses with an AS for a combined 130 million, bringing total gross proceeds since the merger to $2.8 billion. And as we consider our portfolio moving forward, we'll be opportunistic with our balance sheet as a buyer and a seller, focusing on long-term growth and value creation.  Having said that, we don't see any gaps in the portfolio, nor is there any urgency at this time. Consistent with our prior commitments, proceeds from the divestitures will be part of our capital return program. Our expectation now is for buybacks to be roughly $3.6 billion this year versus our prior $3.4 billion. When combined with dividends, capital returns will be about $4.5 billion in 2021. So overall, I'm pleased with the L3Harris team's ability to execute against our strategic priorities and deliver bottom line results despite unanticipated setbacks. With that, I will hand it over to Jay.\nJay Malave: Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. First and starting on Slide 4, I'll provide more detail on the quarter before I get into segment results and our updated outlook. In the quarter, organic revenue was down 1% lower than our internal expectations by about 4.5 points from the supply chain delays in ISR aircraft award timing. IMS and CES were down 3% and 5% respectively, and absentee impacts would've been up closer to the mid-single-digit range for both. The SAS segment was up 3% and led by strong growth in our responsive space business while AS was up 1%, including the benefit from recovery in commercial aerospace. Margins expanded 170 basis points to 19.6% with the most notable drivers being from E3 performance in cost management, which more than offset volume-related supply chain headwinds.  We exceeded our internal expectations by more than a 100 basis points from favorable mix related to award timing and strong E3 performance. The team continues to drive margin upside by delivering an E3 improvements that lead to outperformance in scheduled milestones, costs, and retirement of risk. These drivers, along with our share repurchase activity, drove EPS up 13% or $0.37 to $3.21 as shown on Slide 5. Of this growth synergies and operations contributed $0.39. A lower share count contributed another $0.20, and pension and tax accounted for the remaining $0.08 then more than offset a $0.14 headwind from divested earnings and a $0.16 headwind from supply chain delays.  Free cash flow was $673 million and we ended the quarter steady with working capital days at 56. The supported robust shareholder returns of $1.5 billion comprised of 1.3 billion in share repurchases and $202 million in dividends. Now let's turn to slide 6 and discuss quarterly segment results. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was down 3% driven by follow-on ISR aircraft award timing from a NATO customer that would have contributed 8 points of growth for which revenue has now been booked in October. Revenue was also impacted by the expected timing of WESCAM turret deliveries from a completed facility move. By contrast, our maritime business grew in the mid-single digits from a ramp on key platforms, including the Constellation Class frigate and classified programs.  Operating income was up 4% and margins expanded a 110 basis points to 16.6% from operational excellence, integration benefits, and pension. Funded book-to-bill was 1.04 in the quarter, and 1.05 year-to-date with strength across the segment. In Space and Airborne Systems, revenue increased 3%, driven by double-digit growth in Space, primarily from our ramping missile defense and other responsive programs. The Space growth was more than offset from the production transition -- I'm sorry, the Space program more than offset headwinds from the production transition of the F-35 TR3 program with admission avionics, as well as program timing in Electronic Warfare and Intel and Cyber.  We expect an overall ramp in the quarter -- in the fourth quarter for the segment. Operating income was up 5%, and margins expanded 30 basis points to 18.8% as E3 performance, increased pension income, and integration benefits, more than offset higher R&D investments and mix impacts from growth programs such as in Space. [Indiscernible] to bill was about 1 for the quarter and 1.05 year-to-date, driven by responsive and other Space awards. Next, Communication Systems, organic revenue was down 5% due primarily to product delivery delays within tactical communications that stemmed from the global electronic component shortages, creating an approximately 8 point headwind year-over-year and versus expectations as well as lower volume for a legacy unmanned platforms and broadband due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments.  In addition, the integrated vision and global communication solution businesses were impacted by delivery timing and contract roll-offs on international programs respectively. Conversely, our public safety business was up double-digits versus the prior year and sequentially a strong radio sales following the State of Florida Law Enforcement System Award in the prior quarter. Operating income decreased 1% and margins expanded 130 basis points to 26.3% from operational excellence, including program performance within broadband, favorable mix on public safety radios, and integration benefits that outweighed supply-chain impacts in higher R&D investments. And funded book-to-bill was above 1.1 for both the quarter and year-to-date from strong product bookings within Tactical Communications and integrated vision for monetization alongside key state level awards within public safety.  Finally, in aviation systems, organic revenue increased 1% by our commercial aerospace business that was up over 40% from recover and training and air transport OEM product sales. This growth was weighed down by flattish (ph) sales and mission networks, as well as lower fusing in ordinance systems volume due to contract roll-offs, along with delayed awards within defense aviation. Operating income decreased 13% primarily due to divestitures, while margins expanded a 140 basis points to 14.4% at expense management, the commercial aerospace recovery, and integration benefits more than offset divestiture related headwinds. And finally book-to-bill was 1.1 for the quarter and about 0.9 year-to-date.  Now shifting to our updated 2021 outlook. Organic revenue is now anticipated to be up about 2% with the difference versus our prior guard largely attributable to supply chain delays at the segment level, we've maintained our sale s guides but for CES, where we now anticipate revenue to be down 2.5% to 4.5%. Versus a prior range of up 2.5% to 4.5%. This is largely due to the global supply chain disruptions, mainly within tactical communications that will now be down about 10% versus our prior view of up in the low to mid-single-digits. For the remaining segments, we expect IMS to be in the upper half of the range based on traction with international ISR aircraft while SCS will likely be around the midpoint and driven by growth within Space and Intel & Cyber. And at AS, we expect the segment to be at the lower end of the range due to guard timing slipping to the fourth-quarter within our classified business.  Buy and market, our U.S. government and commercial businesses are now expected to be flattish to up in the low single-digits, while our international businesses are expected to be up mid-single digits plus. This implies fourth quarter sales growth will be in the 1% to 2% range for the Company, which includes CS down in the mid-teens and our other segments up in the mid to high-single-digits on average. Turning to margins, we've raised our outlook to 18.75% from 18.5% due to performance to-date, E3 progress, and favorable mix from award timing. Margins will step back in the fourth quarter due to increased supply chain delays along with mix effects and new earlier stage programs, but still, strong progress for the full year.  From segment perspective, we've improved the outlook for each with CS above the prior midpoint of its range and IMS, SAS and AS above the top end of their prior ranges. On EPS, we're raising the lower end of the prior guide by $0.05 to $12.85 to $13 per share, reflecting 11% growth from 2020 at the midpoint. Delivering on our double-digit aspiration in spite of dilution from divestitures and supply chain headwinds, which otherwise would have put us at or above the top end. As shown on slide 11, the midpoint is now at 1293, that's $0.55 from improvement in operations in other items, including the release of contingencies, offset, additional divested earnings above $0.03 and $0.49 from supply chain delays.  As mentioned previously, we continue to expect about $0.15 of net dilution from divestitures. Moving to free cash flow, our guide of 2.8 to 2.9 remains intact. However, due to prior divestiture, headwinds and now supply chain delays of over a $150 million in the aggregate, we'll likely be toward the lower end. On working capital, we expect to end the year in the low 50s in terms of days, reflecting a 3 to 5 day sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. And Capex is now expected to be around $350 million, about $15 million lower versus the prior expectation, primarily from completed divestitures.  Lastly, our guidance now reflects approximately $3.6 billion in share repurchases, an increase of $200 million from our prior guide to account for net proceeds from recently closed divestitures. None of these puts and takes were in a position to deliver free cash flow per share in the double-digits in 2021. Okay, let me make a few comments on 2022. The L3Harris business fundamentals are sound and we continue to succeed in our strategy of moving up the value chain to capture more prime positions on core, and adjacent applications. Examples include our leadership positions in space missile tracking, ISR aircraft machinization, DOD, and international soldier modernization, undersea sensing, and cyber resiliency. These and others will lead to solid growth for the foreseeable future.  As we look specifically at 2022, we are expecting supply chain impacts to persist into the first half of next year with recovery starting in the back half. As visibility improves over the coming months, we will provide a more comprehensive update on these expectations in January. For now, we are expecting some of the shortfall to be covered by the end of next year and we'll monitor other watch items, including the timing of awards, vaccine mandates, and tax rules.  Having said that, we remain focused on delivering sustainable revenue growth, steady to rising margins, and leading cash flow conversion on a declining share count. So to sum it all up, we've managed the pandemic related headwinds for seventh straight quarter, and delivered strong bottom line performance, and remain on track to meet our commitments for the year and beyond in a dynamic environment. With that, Rob, let's open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourselves to one single part question. If you'd like to ask a question please [Operator Instructions] is in the question queue. You may press [Operator Instructions] if you'd like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it maybe necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we poll for questions. Thank you, our first question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Jay and Rajeev. Jay, you baited us rest right there so I have to ask, in terms of the rethink guides we saw from peers in both supply chain issues and program headwinds they noted, how are you guys thinking about 2022 revenue growth specifics on the multi-year revenue outlook just given you've previously talked about mid-single digits and now peers are calling for flat-to-low single-digit growth.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning, Sheila It's Chris, I think let me make a couple of comments and then I'll lateral it over to Jay. And I think you said it, right. This is clearly the key question for the week. So I want to go back probably three years when we were talking about the strategic rationale for the merger. And there were 2 items of note and I want to go back and reinforce. And 1 was the complementary nature of the 2 businesses. And after the merger, how we're well-positioned in all 5 domains. So when you look at the threat environment which changes on a regular basis, you look about and read a lot about China. I mean, our positioning in space and maritime, I think puts us in a good position to support the war fighter.  Our Cyber capabilities really are applicable not only in China, but all conflicts. I like what we've done in the air domain. While there's applicability in China, it also allows for situational awareness globally. And I think that's critical as we look beyond just the China threat. And the land domain is still a key part of our national security strategy, especially with the focus on resilient comms. So I like the fact that we're well-positioned in all these domains, and I think you see that reflected in our results and we're going to tell you a little bit about 2022. The other one was the revenue synergies. And again, like most of the goals that we set on this merger, we're ahead of schedule. And as I said just a few minutes ago, $900 million of orders earlier than we thought, and I think there's a lot more to come.  So the framework that we laid out 3 years ago, and I've talked about each year remains the same. We think we're well-positioned with the DOD and all domains. We have a great revenue synergy, opportunity and process. And our international growth has been the bright spot over the last couple of years. So, as you would expect, we're going through our strategic planning process. As of today, I see all 4 segments growing in 2022, with the overall Company coming in in the low to mid-single digits on an organic growth basis. We'll obviously give you more details in January. But let me hand it over to Jay to maybe give you more detail by sector and also emphasize the 800 million of headwinds as a result of divestitures when you're doing your comparison. So Jay.\nJay Malave: Sure. Thanks, Chris. And just to follow up on that and maybe just a little bit more color on next year when you think about low to mid-single-digit framework for next year. What I'll do is I'll maybe just take you around the horn of our segments. And I think Chris said it well, as far as broad growth across the portfolio. I'll start with IMS. And this year, we had a guide of 4-6, we've said it will be probably towards the upper end this year. And we see a lot of the same going into 2022 that we've seen here in 2021. The ISR business has been a strong grower force behind the back of international aircraft mechanization. We will see fewer aircraft procurement inputs next year, but that will be more than offset by the ramp in actual throughput related to mechanization in aircraft.  You may recall that Chris, in the second quarter call, talked about 19 aircraft in various stages of mechanization, so that will be a source of growth for that business. And that business can certainly deliver loaded mid-single-digit growth next year, if not more. On the EO business within IMS, Chris mentioned a few awards Electro Optical sensors for the Navy. We're bullish on that, that will be a source of growth for us next year. And again, very capable of being able to deliver low-to-mid-single digit next year and a final business with an IMS is Maritime. Maritime has had a strong record over the -- really since the merger. And we see more of the same there as well. We talk about the Constellation Class frigate.  We've won some awards on the classified undersea sensors, and we continue to expand our capabilities and applications in maritime and we expect that to deliver to frankly mid to high-single-digit growth next year. And so when you look at that segment in total, it's very well-positioned to do a low to mid-single-digit if not more. When you look at space in Air Boeing systems, very similar. We continue to expect space to grow as it did this year. And so you would see something in the -- maybe in the range of mid-to-high single-digits growth there. Same thing with Intel & Cyber. We continue to see growth and demand in declassified areas of both of those businesses.  That will be tempered a bit by our airborne businesses we've seen this year that the transition, particularly mission avionics and on the F-35 from development to production, we'll see that again next year, as well as some program transitions on the electronic warfare, particularly in the F16 program. But nonetheless, even with a flattish to slightly down business in the airborne, we'll see Space and Intel carry that segment forward, very easily, being able to deliver something like in the low to mid-single digits. And I'll go next to maybe AS, and the remaining businesses that we have there. The commercial aero business has moved pretty much in line with the commercial aerospace industry.  We continue to expect our traffic growth next year and we expect that business to grow in line with that. You can expect to see some double-digit growth in that business. Mission networks, Chris mentioned the Australia award that will be a source of growth for us next year. And again, really in the low to mid-single-digit range there. And in our Defense Aviation, it's seeing a little bit of delays related to war timing. But even with a flat projection for next year, that business can deliver -- the segment can deliver low-to-mid-single-digit growth. And then finally CS. And we've talked about SATCOM the supply chain pressures there. This year that that business will be. Now about 10.  And we see if we think about SATCOM, we expect growth even next year off the lower base that we have this year. This year we're going to be impacted in the third and the fourth quarter. We expect to be impacted again in the first and second quarter, we recover the back half. With that recovering the back half, we believe that business can grow in that low to mid-single-digit baseline from this year. And it's really similar with the BCS business, our broadband business, our integrated vision solutions business, and PSPC, which will also just benefit from industry recovery. And so as Chris mentioned, again, I'll close with that.  We really see a broad-based growth in a low to mid-single-digit initial framework is the right way to look at it, really across the portfolio. One last thing, Chris mentioned about $800 million. On a reported basis, we'll see about $800 million of revenue headwind due to the divestitures of next year. But again, starting with the organic, really low-to-mid-single-digit is probably the best place for us to be until we solidify our expectations and we'll do that in January for you. Hopefully that went around the horn and gave you some color within each of the segments, and really give you the source of why we feel confident in our gaining confidence and our ability to deliver that type of growth.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning.\nJay Malave: Good morning.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks for that detail, Jay, that was very helpful. The question I have though is around supply chain, also facing a few issues at the moment. I was wondering what your plans are to mitigate these pressures over the next say 6, 12 months and what the implications could be for say your revenues and margins? Thanks so much.\nChris Kubasik: Alright. Thanks, Rob. Let me kick it off and, again, Jay will give you some more details on the numbers. I think it really hit as we were preparing for this call the last few days when Jay said that we've been through 7 quarters of the pandemic. I mean, it's probably been a blur for all of us, but we really started back in February of 2020 focusing on the supply chain challenge. Just eight months after we closed the merger, we set up our COVID war room and the real focus there was on the first tier suppliers that we had in the Far East. Obviously, since then we've learned a lot about the second, third, fourth tier suppliers and some of the risks in the chain and the resiliency.  So I just want to acknowledge that this is something we've looked at for 7 quarters. Of course, we shifted and as I would say, we always focus on the supply chain, we added in remote working, the IT connections, vaccines, all the challenges that we've gone through in the pandemic. So it's been a little bit of a roller coaster, but the key is then getting our systems consolidated from the merger, getting data, getting visibility, and all of that is improved over the last several quarters. So I think that's what gives us confidence to make some of the projections and talk in a little more detail today. Back in early August, we were probably feeling much better about the year and, you know, August was the high point for the Delta variant spiking around the globe.  And that really threw the delays that we're seeing for the rest of the year. So we're assuming in our baseline is a 12-month delay. Until things get back to normal with the supply chain. I know there's different time-frames out there but that's kind of the baseline that we're focused on. I will mention as a defense contractor, we have the benefit of what's known as D - pass ratings, which are the defense priorities in allocation system. And that's something we've been focused on the last several quarters. And even on the other end of it, the supply chain, a lot of our suppliers are aware of this and are still putting in systems and implementing it. But they've been very supportive in prioritizing our defense products. And I think that's given us a little more confidence and visibility. But that is kind of an overview. I'll ask Jay to maybe give you some of the details on the numbers.\nJay Malave: Sure. Just maybe a couple of other items that we're pretty focused on, Rob. Obviously, I think we're probably no different than others in terms of making longer term commitments, our 12, 18, 24 months in certain cases. We've redeployed resources to make sure we're managing this at lower tiers in the electronic component value chain. And we speak secure alternative sources as well as alternative parts and qualify them. We were redesigning parts in products and electronic components to really ensure that we can have adequate sources supply going into next year. And we're making crop progress across each of these areas, which again is why we're gaining confidence that we'll be able to grow in this business next year.  As far as supply chain specifically, supply-chain escalation is certainly going to be a cost for us when we think about 2022. Right now the I'm thinking about is about 25 basis points of margin pressure associated with escalation costs. I would say that that's something that we were considering, that's something that we've got baked in, and that's something that will be part of our plans to deliver on our E3 productivity. Our goal will be as it always is, to offset the headwinds from mix, as well as supply chain, and deliver at least flat margins, if not higher. The next year will be no different. The pressure is going to be a little bit higher but nonetheless, we believe that we're going to have a solid path to be able to offset it.\nRobert Stallard: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Seth Seifman with J.P Morgan, please proceed with your question.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I guess if I could slip in 2 quick ones here either for Chris or Jay. If you could just address maybe cash-flow next year, your $3 billion target and thoughts on cash flow, growth per share thereafter. And then maybe Jay, the guidance for the integration costs kind of stepping up. It seems to imply a fairly high level in the fourth quarter relative to what we've seen in the past. So maybe what's driving that at this point and where those go from here on out. Thanks.\nChris Kubasik: Okay. I'll maybe take in a reverse order. On the integration costs, we actually saw a step up here in the third quarter. We'll see a little bit higher again here in the fourth quarter. It's really mainly due to two things. One is as we work through our facility consolidations, we've seen an uptick in costs. We expect to see continued spending in that area, probably through the mid-year, next year as we complete those factory consolidations. The other element is a really IT harmonization. We've talked a lot about harmonizing our ERP systems. There were just various systems beyond just our ERPs. We've been working through and incurring the cost on related to integration. That will carry over, I would expect it to next year as well. Some for a period of time again, probably through the first 6 months.\nJay Malave: And your question on $3 billion of free cash flow, for us to the formula really remains the same. We need to deliver annually, I'm including next year, about 3 to 4 days reduction in working capital. And that will offset the growth that otherwise would take place in working capital from just increased use of assets. And so we're able to do that. We should be able to at least hold the working capital flat if not become a source of income, or source of cash flow and then we can have that added to drag drop-through of net income. And so really remains the same as far as our working capital. When you go back and look, we've got we ended the quarter at 56 days. We've got seven sectors who are above that average, which comprises about 2/3 of our working capital. A lot of that is sitting in inventory, and we've talked about this in the past. And we're really, you know, again, it's just blocking and tackling, focusing on fundamentals as far as inventory reduction. This include things like just ensure that we execute against our program milestones. We're synchronizing our forecasting and planning with our supply chain.  We'll continue to work and Chris mentioned it on cycle time reductions in automations in the factory, as well as just negotiating better turns of our contracts, getting more advances where we're looking maybe compare to some of our other peers. Their percentage of advance is a little bit higher than ours, and so that creates an opportunity for us to ensure that we can match cash receipts with cash disbursements on the inventory side. So we're opportunity rich here, 2/3 of our working capital is prime for us to continue to work down. We feel good about that. And look from a free cash flow per share, we're very confident in double-digit growth there for the foreseeable future.\nChris Kubasik: [Indiscernible] in real quick on the integration costs. With the pandemic, we stayed agile and made some changes to strategies. And I'll just say in the IT world, we have laid out an architecture. And with the need for remote work and hybrid work, we re-prioritized and made some changes which caused us to accelerate some of our expenditures in Q3, Q4. Same thing applied to supply chain.  We had a whole strategy and one of those was to hit the end of '22, start investing in the risk dashboard to give us more visibility into our supply chain and identified risks. You've seen publicly available data, whether it's stuff such as wildfires or financial stability in the supply chain. We obviously accelerated that into this year, rolling that out in Q3 and Q4. So some of those things seem to make business sense to increase the cost and accelerate the expenditures based on what was going on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Shapiro Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRichard Safran: Chris, Jay, Rajeev. Good morning. I wanted to ask you about 2 of your programs, if I may. First, that recent GAO decision on the next-gen jammer. I'm curious as to what happens now, f you think the program gets re-competed, do you think changes are made to the program? And the second program I'd like to ask you about is the F-35. We had some long-term guidance come from Lockheed this week. I was just curious if you could discuss a bit how you think that might impact you, where that was relative to expectations, that sort of thing.\nChris Kubasik: Yeah, sure. Rich. Good morning. Let me go with your next-gen jammer question. Just to refresh everyone's memory, we won that program back in December of 2020, almost a year ago. The Navy has affirmed 3 times their choice to select L3Harris, including most recently using an independent reviewer. There's been a lot of media, a lot of discussion on this. We were very proud of the fact that we were rated technically outstanding. And, you know, that's aligns with our strategy. And in the R&D investments that we've made and moving up the food chain, so I think we just let the process proceed. It's somewhere between Navy and Department of Justice and the other Company as to what they're going to do next.  But our team is ready. There was a stop work order put in place which is pretty standard. And whenever that's decided to be lifted we're ready to go, or whatever other legal actions occur. But again, we're very confident in our solution, as is the Navy as they continue to reaffirm their selection. We'll stand by and look forward to supporting the Warfighter when we can get started. F-35, I think we've talked about this on every call. Let me give you a quick update. We're obviously the key player on the F-35. We have a strong position on the platform, about $3 million per shipset. Our overall F-35 revenue is decreasing in '21, decreasing in '22, and then starts to grow again in '23.  That's really a result of the TR3 transition from development to production. And where that may differ a little bit from what you saw -- from the prime, is the fact that we'll be retrofitting several hundred aircrafts so that's what allows us to grow in '23 and beyond. Not only are we going forward with the new aircraft, we're also going to retrofit. And again, the main focus for us is the AMS, the Aircraft Memory System. We just completed safety of flight certifications so that was quite exciting. A lot of positive emails from Lockheed and the customers. So good progress on our AMS. The panoramic cockpit display is entering qualification testing.  And then of course, the integrated core processor is the most complex and, again, we're making progress there. Everybody understands the critical path. And as we've always said, the hard part is ahead of us here as the integration testing is going on. So I think, as I've said the last several quarters, the teamwork is much better than I've ever seen. Everybody is aligned, everybody understands the goals, the challenges, and the critical path, and we're honored to be on that platform and look forward to delivering on our commitment.\nOperator: That's a question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nGautam Khanna: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning.\nGautam Khanna: I was wondering if you could give us some color on the Tactical IRS backlog where it stands now, kind of the longer-term outlook in that business. I know you gave a view on 22, but just longer term. What do you have in the pipeline both domestically and foreign and give any color you can provide there. Thanks.\nChris Kubasik: Yeah. Let me take a first shot at this one. Well, first of all, we have a record backlog of $1.2 billion, and that's the best we had in the past 10 years. So relative to that, there is no issue relative to demand, and book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.7 in year to date, we're almost at 1.2, so there is absolutely 0 issue with the demand. I highlighted some of the significant wins that we had recently with the army. You're well aware of those large, high IDIQs and how there is a lot of runway to go relative to those. So we're feeling really good on the demand and the outlook. We're going to see growth in '22 internationally. I think there continues to be lots of interest for this year. Asia-Pacific region and Central and Latin America are growing. Europe and the Mid East is a little flat, but as we look further out in '23 and beyond, I see that trend switching.  I think Jay did a good job, just of highlighting it. We look like -- we do about -- if I go back to 2020, we're doing about $450 million, roughly, per quarter in revenue. In '21, the first 2 quarters, due to our growth, we were closer to $475 million. Third quarter, we came in at $400 million and the fourth quarter probably going to be in that $300 million to $400 million range depending on supply chain. I see that trend continuing for the first 2 quarters of next year. The 300 to 400 range, and then maybe ramping up to 500 plus for the second half of 22 and the first two quarters of '23 will make up for the shortfall. So I'm trying to give you some color there based on what we see in backlog and the opportunities that we have around the globe. I don't know Jay if there's more.\nJay Malave: Yeah. Maybe just a little bit. Chris mentioned, I think in his remarks as well as far as a Middle East customer. What we have here, these are $1 billion plus type opportunities with this Middle East customer as well as the U.K. and Australia. And what we've been able to do in each case is when front-end type of contracts. And so right now with this particular country we won about 5,000 radios, that could be potential up to 50,000 radios over a number of years. And so being on the front end will position us well for that longer-term opportunity. The same thing goes with the U.K. We just want an opportunity to do tech refresh on current radios. Net positions as well, for what could be it also another opportunity of 50,000 radios, billion-dollar plus program.  If similarly, Australia you're looking at potentially 35,000 radios. In our ballpark, we also want an opportunity there to do some crypto monetization on installed base. And so winning these early awards puts us in positions j us t very well for these long-term large programs in each of these countries, we've got a DoD opportunity coming up on either this quarter or next quarter with the marine corps. We feel confident in our positioning there and our products offering for that. And so we're confident and bullish about the opportunities for the Tactical Radio business going forward in our positioning as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKristine Liwag: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning.\nKristine Liwag: Chris, segment margins were 19.5% in the quarter. Rounding, you're at that 20% margin you've been targeting, but your full-year 2021 guide implies a step-down in 4Q. Can you provide more details on the puts and takes and how we should think about margins going into 2022? I know it's too early for a 2022 guide, but is 20% a 4?\nChris Kubasik: Good to see on a Friday. Nobody's lost their sense of humor. Now I said earlier, everything related to the merger is going to go on quicker and better than maybe anyone had expected or planned. And we've talked about a 25 basis point increase year-over-year. So the way I look at it is we're a year or 2 ahead of that target. And the goal for '22 and beyond will be to, at a minimum maintain these margins, but look for ways to increase it. I mean, some of the things that contributed, and I'll let Jay give you more details on Q3. We've really been focusing on our discretionary spend the SG&A. I think this was one of our lower quarters since the merger as a percent of revenue. We continue to invest in the irad at about 4% of revenue, which I think has been positioned us for this growth that we talked about going forward. And these -- the mix from these new awards -- talked about some of these awards being delayed.  I think, you know, most of these new awards initially are dilutive to margins as you win, especially if there are cost plus or even if they're fixed price, just being conservative so -- but those slipping to Q4. I think that accounts for some of the shift between the 2 quarters, but we look at it on an annual basis, and year-over-year progress is looking good. And we're not going to give up, and we're going to continue with our E3 initiatives. The E3 focus is really what's making the difference. And I tried to highlight some of the things we're doing relative to labor productivity. We're using collaborative robots and augmented reality and some interesting technology that's just going to get our products to market quicker.  We talked about the supply chain and some of the things we're doing there, value-engineering, more and more focused on making our products even more manufacturable, we talked about designing for manufacture, design for supply chain. All those initiatives are ongoing and getting better each and every time, so I don't have [Indiscernible]. Further color you want to give?\nJay Malave: Yeah. Just on Q4, as you mentioned, we will see some just newer awards which have lower margins on it. And then the Tactile Communication business steps down in Q4, so I'll put pressure on the margins from a business mix perspective. And so that's really the driver for Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Harned: Good morning. Thank you.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning.\nJay Malave: Good morning.\nDoug Harned: You've talked a lot about supply chain today and a lot of companies have lot of industrial companies, whether they are in defense and honest talked about it. But I'd like to -- what I wanted to understand is in -- supply chain issues have clearly held you back some in communication systems this year and you talked about the first half of next year. But unlike some commercial businesses, I wouldn't expect any of the deliveries and revenues that you were expecting to have gone away. And when you think forward, should we expect the snapback eventually here, where you've just, you've built up -- you've got building up of a backlog of demand and we should actually see what I would think of as a surge when we get into 2023, when you're finally delivering on things that have been delayed?\nChris Kubasik: Yeah. Now, Doug, that's great question. I think you hit it. I tried to maybe to subtly suggest that this is a timing impact. And I think you're absolutely right. What we're seeing is these deliveries basically being deferred or sliding to the right. About 25% of our business we forecast to demand, the rest we forecast to programs which is easier to do and less risky. So on the quick turn or the more product businesses you're forecasting demand, Jay mentioned we're now making commitments 12 to 18 months out versus a couple of months. It's in-advance like we used to in the past. So when you look at the supply chain challenges to the extensive if a product or something that we recognize revenue upon delivery, you're absolutely right. You will see that as a bow wave.  The majority of our Company, and I think the whole industry, uses a percent complete or over time accounting. So in that case, you're maybe not going to see the revenue hit, but what you are going to see is a potential delay in ultimately making a delivery, which maybe causes companies to miss their milestones, which could be pressure on billing and cash to the extent it's tied to a milestone event. So I think you're absolutely right. We view this as a delay and a deferral. I mentioned the ability to use the Deepak ratings to get our parts. And as I mentioned, we haven't missed any commitments relative to our contracts and that's something that's very important to all of us and we\u2019ll continue to find ways to deliver to those commitments.  The revenue shortfall was our focus on over driving and challenging the team to get the year-over-year growth. But as far as the contracts we're tracking and we're in constant communication with all of our customers and they understand where we are. So I don't know if that helps you, Doug, but that's a long way of saying I agree with you.\nDoug Harned: Yes. Doug. You got it exactly right. I mean, 2022 I mentioned it would grow. We'd love it to snap back in 2022, but that's unlikely, but we would expect that recovery to be in '23.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Arment: Thanks. Good morning, Chris. And Chris, thanks for all the details on that kind of the progress we're making on E3, but kind of just tying back to your comments that you've been operating in 7 quarters in the pandemic that feel like eternity but did -- you set up the E3 program before the pandemic, did you get any kind of opportunities that evolved during the last 7 quarters where you think there is significantly more upside that you can do from the 350 million target that you put out there? Thanks.\nChris Kubasik: Now, Peter, the 350 target we threw out was the cost synergies from the merger. We'll be putting a bow on that here in the next few quarters, and we've over-driven the synergies that we laid out. Anything post the merger synergies will count towards the E3 program. I think we've learned a lot, as I've said, relative to the pandemic, how we do business. And I didn't really get to focus on International as an example. And it's still amazing to me that we're effectively double-digit on international growth. And it's probably the worst time ever to do business internationally during the pandemic, but I think we learned a lot as to how to better use our time. I've been on all sorts of Zoom calls at strange hours of the data to connect with customers. And if you have those prior relationships so it's still going to be beneficial to get on an airplane and see people face-to-face.  But I think we've been able to find a way to do business more effectively. We're going to have about 10% of the workforce working remotely permanently and have about 20% doing hybrid. So those are all new and different ways to do business. And we're excited about the future. Haven't less people in the facilities, we've been able to go ahead and make some of the changes or highlight it in the factory and go ahead with the -- some of the robots that we're using, some of these light guide tools. It's just easier to get those things done. Jay mentioned the facility consolidation. We probably lost a little bit of time, as you would imagine, due to the pandemic, no one being vaccinated, and the difficulty getting labor, but now we're picking that pace back up again. Yes, we see this as really being a differentiator, something that's in our DNA and something that everybody is engaged with. Thank you for the question, Peter. I guess with that, we'll just wrap it up for the day. Obviously, I'd like to recognize the 47,000 employees who were focused on delivering value for our stakeholders, and they continue to overcome the unprecedented challenges presented by the pandemic. Their resilience, combined with the many opportunities ahead, keep me, Jay, and the whole leadership team excited about the future of L3Harris. I thank you for joining the call, and look forward to talking to you again in January. Have a great week. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference.

As you've seen throughout the week, no Company is immune, including L3Harris to global supply chain pressures, a risk we highlighted at the last earnings call. In recent months, shortages of electronic components began adversely impacting our Company at a time when our product is strong. Our updated full-year guidance now accounts for these impacts. We revised our organic revenue growth expectations to approximately 2%, primarily due to delays for these components weighing on the CS segment. [Indiscernible] such delays, we would have comfortably been within our prior 3% to 5% range. Ultimately, this is a timing shift with no anticipated effect on our industry best market position for radios.  And with our broad and diversified portfolio, along with continued execution elsewhere, especially on the margin front we've increased our range on EPS to $12.85 to $13 per share, and still expect to deliver free cash flow per share of around $14, up double-digit on both accounts. Shifting over to the third quarter, following organic revenue growth of 6% in the second quarter, we saw a decline of 1% due to timing associated with supply chain delays at CES and an ISR aircraft awarded IMS. While I'm disappointed by the soft top-line results, I'll note that the order momentum remains strong with a book-to-bill of 1.07 and we delivered record high margins at 19.6%. EPS was $3.21 up 13% versus the prior year with solid free cash flow of 673 million that contributed to shareholder returns of 1.5 billion in the quarter.  Our execution against the Company's strategy priorities have been a key factor and value creation for all stakeholders, In spite of the pandemic. And we make progress in the quarter by advancing top-line opportunities, improving operational performance, wrapping up portfolio shaping, and returning capital to our owners. Starting with the top line, the revenue declined and the quarter fell short of our internal targets, largely due to 2 timing factors. At CES, the global electronic component shortage has led to a supply chain disruption for our product and electronics focused businesses, notably tactical communications. In the third quarter, the impact was nearly a $100 million or approximately 2 points of revenue.  And in the fourth quarter, our expectation is for the backlog of unfilled orders to grow, and all told we foresee a roughly $250 million to $300 million revenue impact for the year, implying another step-down in the fourth quarter. This is the primary driver of our revenue guidance adjustment at CES. Having said that, we do not anticipate any impact to our bookings, nor our win rates, and expect the segment to end the year with a book-to-bill well over one times. In addition, despite the supply chain challenges we faced in Q3 and ongoing headwinds, we were able to meet delivery requirements on all of our key U.S. DoD modernization programs, and are on track to continue to do so in the fourth quarter, including deliveries on the recently awarded HMS full rate production contract with the U.S. Army.  Second, in IMS we had a follow on ISR aircraft order with a NATO customer that booked to late in the quarter, causing revenues to slip to Q4, representing roughly a 2.5 shift between quarters. While the supply chain headwinds is limit upside opportunities to our revenues for this year, I have been pleased with the team's traction against our strategy of delivering end-to-end solutions to global militaries as a trusted disruptor across all domains. And it's reflected in our order activity and operational milestones. Within the space domain on the classified side, we continue to advance our responsive and exquisite satellite business with several earlier-stage awards, both with the intel Community and DoD, which have follow-on opportunities of nearly $2 billion.  And on the unclassified side, following the imager award in Q2, NOAA is progressing on the recapitalization of its geo weather satellite system and awarded us a study contract for a sounder payload as part of a $3 billion opportunity over the next decade. On the operational front, we completed the preliminary design review in the development of the missile tracking satellite prototype for the Space Development Agency, progressing towards a launch over the coming years, and reflecting yet another significant accomplishment for L3Harris. Moving to the air domain, key awards within the quarter spanned both legacy and next-generation aircraft.  On the B52, we received a 10-year $1 billion IDIQ that has the potential to expand our scope on the program to include EW hardware upgrades such as radar warning receivers, building on our existing software sustainment work. In addition on the international front, we were awarded an initial a $100 million contract to provide capabilities on 12 multi-mission aircraft for the UAE with the potential to double these amounts further demonstrating the breadth of our ISR capabilities that range from turbo props to business jets, to large aircraft. And in the land domain, we were awarded several contracts with the U.S. Army to advance its modernization priorities.  Under the army H MS Program, we received over 200 million in awards for the manpack and leader radios, taking a majority share on both products. These are the first full rate production awards out of a multibillion -dollar IDIQ, and represents less than 15% of the acquisition objective, pointing to considerable runway ahead. We also want a majority share on the second program of record for the EM VGV program with $100 million order, setting us up to ramp production on the Army's next-generation field ready cargos. So we were three for three on strategically significant programs in the land domain this quarter. Within the maritime domain, the team continues to progress on the U.S. Navy Constellation Class frigate with follow-on awards for the next chipset of electrical propulsion and navigation systems as part of a several $100 million opportunity for L3Harris.  We're also awaiting decisions on 2 major prime awards over the coming months. One to provide Electro Optical infrared capabilities on a broad range of the U.S. Navy surface combatants and another with an international ally, highlighting our superior undersea censor capabilities. Both would expand our market reach in this domain. Operationally, the team delivered power conversion suite hardware as part of the Virginia Class block 5 upgrade and completed qualifications for a portion of the power distribution system on the Columbian Class, advancing the U.S. Navy's top priority. We also had a key award within our mission networks business.  We leveraged the air traffic management capabilities we provide to the FAA, winning a new international franchise with the Australian government to modernize the nation's air traffic control and surveillance networks. This program is an over $300 million opportunity, and strengthens L3Harris's long-standing relationship with Australia. Finally, we received a strategic award on the revenue synergy front as we signed a $130 million contract with a mid east customer to provide modernized, software-defined radios through a localized joint venture. And this customer channels synergy award opens the door to a long-term opportunity for up to 50,000 radios.  When combined with other orders in the quarter, revenue synergy awards to-date totaled roughly 900 million on a win rate that remains at 70%. For the pipeline of over $7 billion, these synergies will be a notable contributor to our top-line growth. This win supported, another strong quarter for a book-to-bill 1.07 and 1.06 times year-to-date, increasing our organic backlog to $21 billion. We're up 9% from last year and 4% year-to-date. This is validation of our internal investments in leading R&D spend, as well as confirmation of our alignment with government priorities. Shifting over to the outlook for budgets, we're pleased with the progress made on the FY22 defense spending bills that continue to prioritize near-peer threats, notwithstanding another CR.  To plus ups from the HASC, SaaS, and SAC-D along with steadiness from HAC -D, combined with recent global events provide a degree of comfort that we should expect stability in military spending over the coming years. And in my personal discussions with senior leadership of the administration and Congress, I have consistently heard of a growing need for innovative, resilient and affordable solutions which we're focused on providing. All-in-all, as we consider the trajectory of our top-line, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth through our domestic positioning, revenue synergies, and international expansion that stem from a pipeline of opportunities well in excess of a $100 billion.  Pivoting the margin performance our team delivered a stellar quarter at 19.6%, the best post-merger results and an indication of the Company's potential over the next couple of years as we further build a culture of operational excellence. Our performance was the result of delivering another 15 million of incremental cost synergies, and we're well on track to hit our $350 million target. We continue to manage our overhead costs and drive our E3 program to more than offsetting supply chain headwinds. Due primarily to our year-to-date results, we now see margins for 2021 exceeding our prior expectation of 18.5% by 25 basis points. Beyond 2021, our E3 program will remain a key contributor to steady expansion in our operating margins, net of inflationary pressures.  This program is one of our key discriminators. And let me highlight just a couple of examples. First, is factory optimization that represents half of this opportunity set. Through streamlining and simplifying our manufacturing processes, be it from a redesign of a factory's layout or integrating automation tools, we can shorten cycle times, increase labor efficiency and continue to drive out costs. A great example is the pilot program at our Amityville facility in New York, where an augmented reality assembly aid that electronically displays and validates our processes helps reduce cycle time by 25% and higher first-pass yields by several points. And we're in the early stages of a strategy with a 3-year roll out ahead of us. The other half of our opportunity comes from the engineering excellence hand supply chain.  On the former, through the deployment of our digital ecosystem, front-loading our program activities, and enhancing training for our roughly 20,000 engineers and 1,500 program managers, we're able to increase commonality and better manage cost and schedule across the Company. These have been key with some of our standout wins within the Space domain, enabling a foray into missile defense, as well as with driving favorability in our EACs. On supply chain, the global disruption we've highlighted have been largely contained to about 15% of the Company, and are temporary in nature.  The focus we've had, be it on reducing the number of suppliers are leveraging our roughly $7.5 billion spend as an enterprise, remain in place with further opportunities. In the years ahead. Moving over to the portfolio, we put a bow on the post-merger shaping activities in the quarter and closed on the electron devices divestiture for $185 million, while announcing the sale of 2 small businesses with an AS for a combined 130 million, bringing total gross proceeds since the merger to $2.8 billion. And as we consider our portfolio moving forward, we'll be opportunistic with our balance sheet as a buyer and a seller, focusing on long-term growth and value creation.  Having said that, we don't see any gaps in the portfolio, nor is there any urgency at this time. Consistent with our prior commitments, proceeds from the divestitures will be part of our capital return program. Our expectation now is for buybacks to be roughly $3.6 billion this year versus our prior $3.4 billion. When combined with dividends, capital returns will be about $4.5 billion in 2021. So overall, I'm pleased with the L3Harris team's ability to execute against our strategic priorities and deliver bottom line results despite unanticipated setbacks. With that, I will hand it over to Jay. Good morning, Sheila It's Chris, I think let me make a couple of comments and then I'll lateral it over to Jay. And I think you said it, right. This is clearly the key question for the week. So I want to go back probably three years when we were talking about the strategic rationale for the merger. And there were 2 items of note and I want to go back and reinforce. And 1 was the complementary nature of the 2 businesses. And after the merger, how we're well-positioned in all 5 domains. So when you look at the threat environment which changes on a regular basis, you look about and read a lot about China. I mean, our positioning in space and maritime, I think puts us in a good position to support the war fighter.  Our Cyber capabilities really are applicable not only in China, but all conflicts. I like what we've done in the air domain. While there's applicability in China, it also allows for situational awareness globally. And I think that's critical as we look beyond just the China threat. And the land domain is still a key part of our national security strategy, especially with the focus on resilient comms. So I like the fact that we're well-positioned in all these domains, and I think you see that reflected in our results and we're going to tell you a little bit about 2022. The other one was the revenue synergies. And again, like most of the goals that we set on this merger, we're ahead of schedule. And as I said just a few minutes ago, $900 million of orders earlier than we thought, and I think there's a lot more to come.  So the framework that we laid out 3 years ago, and I've talked about each year remains the same. We think we're well-positioned with the DOD and all domains. We have a great revenue synergy, opportunity and process. And our international growth has been the bright spot over the last couple of years. So, as you would expect, we're going through our strategic planning process. As of today, I see all 4 segments growing in 2022, with the overall Company coming in in the low to mid-single digits on an organic growth basis. We'll obviously give you more details in January. But let me hand it over to Jay to maybe give you more detail by sector and also emphasize the 800 million of headwinds as a result of divestitures when you're doing your comparison. So Jay. Good morning. Alright. Thanks, Rob. Let me kick it off and, again, Jay will give you some more details on the numbers. I think it really hit as we were preparing for this call the last few days when Jay said that we've been through 7 quarters of the pandemic. I mean, it's probably been a blur for all of us, but we really started back in February of 2020 focusing on the supply chain challenge. Just eight months after we closed the merger, we set up our COVID war room and the real focus there was on the first tier suppliers that we had in the Far East. Obviously, since then we've learned a lot about the second, third, fourth tier suppliers and some of the risks in the chain and the resiliency.  So I just want to acknowledge that this is something we've looked at for 7 quarters. Of course, we shifted and as I would say, we always focus on the supply chain, we added in remote working, the IT connections, vaccines, all the challenges that we've gone through in the pandemic. So it's been a little bit of a roller coaster, but the key is then getting our systems consolidated from the merger, getting data, getting visibility, and all of that is improved over the last several quarters. So I think that's what gives us confidence to make some of the projections and talk in a little more detail today. Back in early August, we were probably feeling much better about the year and, you know, August was the high point for the Delta variant spiking around the globe.  And that really threw the delays that we're seeing for the rest of the year. So we're assuming in our baseline is a 12-month delay. Until things get back to normal with the supply chain. I know there's different time-frames out there but that's kind of the baseline that we're focused on. I will mention as a defense contractor, we have the benefit of what's known as D - pass ratings, which are the defense priorities in allocation system. And that's something we've been focused on the last several quarters. And even on the other end of it, the supply chain, a lot of our suppliers are aware of this and are still putting in systems and implementing it. But they've been very supportive in prioritizing our defense products. And I think that's given us a little more confidence and visibility. But that is kind of an overview. I'll ask Jay to maybe give you some of the details on the numbers. Okay. I'll maybe take in a reverse order. On the integration costs, we actually saw a step up here in the third quarter. We'll see a little bit higher again here in the fourth quarter. It's really mainly due to two things. One is as we work through our facility consolidations, we've seen an uptick in costs. We expect to see continued spending in that area, probably through the mid-year, next year as we complete those factory consolidations. The other element is a really IT harmonization. We've talked a lot about harmonizing our ERP systems. There were just various systems beyond just our ERPs. We've been working through and incurring the cost on related to integration. That will carry over, I would expect it to next year as well. Some for a period of time again, probably through the first 6 months. [Indiscernible] in real quick on the integration costs. With the pandemic, we stayed agile and made some changes to strategies. And I'll just say in the IT world, we have laid out an architecture. And with the need for remote work and hybrid work, we re-prioritized and made some changes which caused us to accelerate some of our expenditures in Q3, Q4. Same thing applied to supply chain.  We had a whole strategy and one of those was to hit the end of '22, start investing in the risk dashboard to give us more visibility into our supply chain and identified risks. You've seen publicly available data, whether it's stuff such as wildfires or financial stability in the supply chain. We obviously accelerated that into this year, rolling that out in Q3 and Q4. So some of those things seem to make business sense to increase the cost and accelerate the expenditures based on what was going on. Yeah, sure. Rich. Good morning. Let me go with your next-gen jammer question. Just to refresh everyone's memory, we won that program back in December of 2020, almost a year ago. The Navy has affirmed 3 times their choice to select L3Harris, including most recently using an independent reviewer. There's been a lot of media, a lot of discussion on this. We were very proud of the fact that we were rated technically outstanding. And, you know, that's aligns with our strategy. And in the R&D investments that we've made and moving up the food chain, so I think we just let the process proceed. It's somewhere between Navy and Department of Justice and the other Company as to what they're going to do next.  But our team is ready. There was a stop work order put in place which is pretty standard. And whenever that's decided to be lifted we're ready to go, or whatever other legal actions occur. But again, we're very confident in our solution, as is the Navy as they continue to reaffirm their selection. We'll stand by and look forward to supporting the Warfighter when we can get started. F-35, I think we've talked about this on every call. Let me give you a quick update. We're obviously the key player on the F-35. We have a strong position on the platform, about $3 million per shipset. Our overall F-35 revenue is decreasing in '21, decreasing in '22, and then starts to grow again in '23.  That's really a result of the TR3 transition from development to production. And where that may differ a little bit from what you saw -- from the prime, is the fact that we'll be retrofitting several hundred aircrafts so that's what allows us to grow in '23 and beyond. Not only are we going forward with the new aircraft, we're also going to retrofit. And again, the main focus for us is the AMS, the Aircraft Memory System. We just completed safety of flight certifications so that was quite exciting. A lot of positive emails from Lockheed and the customers. So good progress on our AMS. The panoramic cockpit display is entering qualification testing.  And then of course, the integrated core processor is the most complex and, again, we're making progress there. Everybody understands the critical path. And as we've always said, the hard part is ahead of us here as the integration testing is going on. So I think, as I've said the last several quarters, the teamwork is much better than I've ever seen. Everybody is aligned, everybody understands the goals, the challenges, and the critical path, and we're honored to be on that platform and look forward to delivering on our commitment. Good morning. Yeah. Let me take a first shot at this one. Well, first of all, we have a record backlog of $1.2 billion, and that's the best we had in the past 10 years. So relative to that, there is no issue relative to demand, and book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.7 in year to date, we're almost at 1.2, so there is absolutely 0 issue with the demand. I highlighted some of the significant wins that we had recently with the army. You're well aware of those large, high IDIQs and how there is a lot of runway to go relative to those. So we're feeling really good on the demand and the outlook. We're going to see growth in '22 internationally. I think there continues to be lots of interest for this year. Asia-Pacific region and Central and Latin America are growing. Europe and the Mid East is a little flat, but as we look further out in '23 and beyond, I see that trend switching.  I think Jay did a good job, just of highlighting it. We look like -- we do about -- if I go back to 2020, we're doing about $450 million, roughly, per quarter in revenue. In '21, the first 2 quarters, due to our growth, we were closer to $475 million. Third quarter, we came in at $400 million and the fourth quarter probably going to be in that $300 million to $400 million range depending on supply chain. I see that trend continuing for the first 2 quarters of next year. The 300 to 400 range, and then maybe ramping up to 500 plus for the second half of 22 and the first two quarters of '23 will make up for the shortfall. So I'm trying to give you some color there based on what we see in backlog and the opportunities that we have around the globe. I don't know Jay if there's more. Good morning. Good to see on a Friday. Nobody's lost their sense of humor. Now I said earlier, everything related to the merger is going to go on quicker and better than maybe anyone had expected or planned. And we've talked about a 25 basis point increase year-over-year. So the way I look at it is we're a year or 2 ahead of that target. And the goal for '22 and beyond will be to, at a minimum maintain these margins, but look for ways to increase it. I mean, some of the things that contributed, and I'll let Jay give you more details on Q3. We've really been focusing on our discretionary spend the SG&A. I think this was one of our lower quarters since the merger as a percent of revenue. We continue to invest in the irad at about 4% of revenue, which I think has been positioned us for this growth that we talked about going forward. And these -- the mix from these new awards -- talked about some of these awards being delayed.  I think, you know, most of these new awards initially are dilutive to margins as you win, especially if there are cost plus or even if they're fixed price, just being conservative so -- but those slipping to Q4. I think that accounts for some of the shift between the 2 quarters, but we look at it on an annual basis, and year-over-year progress is looking good. And we're not going to give up, and we're going to continue with our E3 initiatives. The E3 focus is really what's making the difference. And I tried to highlight some of the things we're doing relative to labor productivity. We're using collaborative robots and augmented reality and some interesting technology that's just going to get our products to market quicker.  We talked about the supply chain and some of the things we're doing there, value-engineering, more and more focused on making our products even more manufacturable, we talked about designing for manufacture, design for supply chain. All those initiatives are ongoing and getting better each and every time, so I don't have [Indiscernible]. Further color you want to give? Good morning. Yeah. Now, Doug, that's great question. I think you hit it. I tried to maybe to subtly suggest that this is a timing impact. And I think you're absolutely right. What we're seeing is these deliveries basically being deferred or sliding to the right. About 25% of our business we forecast to demand, the rest we forecast to programs which is easier to do and less risky. So on the quick turn or the more product businesses you're forecasting demand, Jay mentioned we're now making commitments 12 to 18 months out versus a couple of months. It's in-advance like we used to in the past. So when you look at the supply chain challenges to the extensive if a product or something that we recognize revenue upon delivery, you're absolutely right. You will see that as a bow wave.  The majority of our Company, and I think the whole industry, uses a percent complete or over time accounting. So in that case, you're maybe not going to see the revenue hit, but what you are going to see is a potential delay in ultimately making a delivery, which maybe causes companies to miss their milestones, which could be pressure on billing and cash to the extent it's tied to a milestone event. So I think you're absolutely right. We view this as a delay and a deferral. I mentioned the ability to use the Deepak ratings to get our parts. And as I mentioned, we haven't missed any commitments relative to our contracts and that's something that's very important to all of us and we'll continue to find ways to deliver to those commitments.  The revenue shortfall was our focus on over driving and challenging the team to get the year-over-year growth. But as far as the contracts we're tracking and we're in constant communication with all of our customers and they understand where we are. So I don't know if that helps you, Doug, but that's a long way of saying I agree with you. Now, Peter, the 350 target we threw out was the cost synergies from the merger. We'll be putting a bow on that here in the next few quarters, and we've over-driven the synergies that we laid out. Anything post the merger synergies will count towards the E3 program. I think we've learned a lot, as I've said, relative to the pandemic, how we do business. And I didn't really get to focus on International as an example. And it's still amazing to me that we're effectively double-digit on international growth. And it's probably the worst time ever to do business internationally during the pandemic, but I think we learned a lot as to how to better use our time. I've been on all sorts of Zoom calls at strange hours of the data to connect with customers. And if you have those prior relationships so it's still going to be beneficial to get on an airplane and see people face-to-face.  But I think we've been able to find a way to do business more effectively. We're going to have about 10% of the workforce working remotely permanently and have about 20% doing hybrid. So those are all new and different ways to do business. And we're excited about the future. Haven't less people in the facilities, we've been able to go ahead and make some of the changes or highlight it in the factory and go ahead with the -- some of the robots that we're using, some of these light guide tools. It's just easier to get those things done. Jay mentioned the facility consolidation. We probably lost a little bit of time, as you would imagine, due to the pandemic, no one being vaccinated, and the difficulty getting labor, but now we're picking that pace back up again. Yes, we see this as really being a differentiator, something that's in our DNA and something that everybody is engaged with. Thank you for the question, Peter. I guess with that, we'll just wrap it up for the day. Obviously, I'd like to recognize the 47,000 employees who were focused on delivering value for our stakeholders, and they continue to overcome the unprecedented challenges presented by the pandemic. Their resilience, combined with the many opportunities ahead, keep me, Jay, and the whole leadership team excited about the future of L3Harris. I thank you for joining the call, and look forward to talking to you again in January. Have a great week. Thanks."

            "name": "Jay Malave",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris. And good morning, everyone. First and starting on Slide 4, I'll provide more detail on the quarter before I get into segment results and our updated outlook. In the quarter, organic revenue was down 1% lower than our internal expectations by about 4.5 points from the supply chain delays in ISR aircraft award timing. IMS and CES were down 3% and 5% respectively, and absentee impacts would've been up closer to the mid-single-digit range for both. The SAS segment was up 3% and led by strong growth in our responsive space business while AS was up 1%, including the benefit from recovery in commercial aerospace. Margins expanded 170 basis points to 19.6% with the most notable drivers being from E3 performance in cost management, which more than offset volume-related supply chain headwinds.  We exceeded our internal expectations by more than a 100 basis points from favorable mix related to award timing and strong E3 performance. The team continues to drive margin upside by delivering an E3 improvements that lead to outperformance in scheduled milestones, costs, and retirement of risk. These drivers, along with our share repurchase activity, drove EPS up 13% or $0.37 to $3.21 as shown on Slide 5. Of this growth synergies and operations contributed $0.39. A lower share count contributed another $0.20, and pension and tax accounted for the remaining $0.08 then more than offset a $0.14 headwind from divested earnings and a $0.16 headwind from supply chain delays.  Free cash flow was $673 million and we ended the quarter steady with working capital days at 56. The supported robust shareholder returns of $1.5 billion comprised of 1.3 billion in share repurchases and $202 million in dividends. Now let's turn to slide 6 and discuss quarterly segment results. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was down 3% driven by follow-on ISR aircraft award timing from a NATO customer that would have contributed 8 points of growth for which revenue has now been booked in October. Revenue was also impacted by the expected timing of WESCAM turret deliveries from a completed facility move. By contrast, our maritime business grew in the mid-single digits from a ramp on key platforms, including the Constellation Class frigate and classified programs.  Operating income was up 4% and margins expanded a 110 basis points to 16.6% from operational excellence, integration benefits, and pension. Funded book-to-bill was 1.04 in the quarter, and 1.05 year-to-date with strength across the segment. In Space and Airborne Systems, revenue increased 3%, driven by double-digit growth in Space, primarily from our ramping missile defense and other responsive programs. The Space growth was more than offset from the production transition -- I'm sorry, the Space program more than offset headwinds from the production transition of the F-35 TR3 program with admission avionics, as well as program timing in Electronic Warfare and Intel and Cyber.  We expect an overall ramp in the quarter -- in the fourth quarter for the segment. Operating income was up 5%, and margins expanded 30 basis points to 18.8% as E3 performance, increased pension income, and integration benefits, more than offset higher R&D investments and mix impacts from growth programs such as in Space. [Indiscernible] to bill was about 1 for the quarter and 1.05 year-to-date, driven by responsive and other Space awards. Next, Communication Systems, organic revenue was down 5% due primarily to product delivery delays within tactical communications that stemmed from the global electronic component shortages, creating an approximately 8 point headwind year-over-year and versus expectations as well as lower volume for a legacy unmanned platforms and broadband due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments.  In addition, the integrated vision and global communication solution businesses were impacted by delivery timing and contract roll-offs on international programs respectively. Conversely, our public safety business was up double-digits versus the prior year and sequentially a strong radio sales following the State of Florida Law Enforcement System Award in the prior quarter. Operating income decreased 1% and margins expanded 130 basis points to 26.3% from operational excellence, including program performance within broadband, favorable mix on public safety radios, and integration benefits that outweighed supply-chain impacts in higher R&D investments. And funded book-to-bill was above 1.1 for both the quarter and year-to-date from strong product bookings within Tactical Communications and integrated vision for monetization alongside key state level awards within public safety.  Finally, in aviation systems, organic revenue increased 1% by our commercial aerospace business that was up over 40% from recover and training and air transport OEM product sales. This growth was weighed down by flattish (ph) sales and mission networks, as well as lower fusing in ordinance systems volume due to contract roll-offs, along with delayed awards within defense aviation. Operating income decreased 13% primarily due to divestitures, while margins expanded a 140 basis points to 14.4% at expense management, the commercial aerospace recovery, and integration benefits more than offset divestiture related headwinds. And finally book-to-bill was 1.1 for the quarter and about 0.9 year-to-date.  Now shifting to our updated 2021 outlook. Organic revenue is now anticipated to be up about 2% with the difference versus our prior guard largely attributable to supply chain delays at the segment level, we've maintained our sale s guides but for CES, where we now anticipate revenue to be down 2.5% to 4.5%. Versus a prior range of up 2.5% to 4.5%. This is largely due to the global supply chain disruptions, mainly within tactical communications that will now be down about 10% versus our prior view of up in the low to mid-single-digits. For the remaining segments, we expect IMS to be in the upper half of the range based on traction with international ISR aircraft while SCS will likely be around the midpoint and driven by growth within Space and Intel & Cyber. And at AS, we expect the segment to be at the lower end of the range due to guard timing slipping to the fourth-quarter within our classified business.  Buy and market, our U.S. government and commercial businesses are now expected to be flattish to up in the low single-digits, while our international businesses are expected to be up mid-single digits plus. This implies fourth quarter sales growth will be in the 1% to 2% range for the Company, which includes CS down in the mid-teens and our other segments up in the mid to high-single-digits on average. Turning to margins, we've raised our outlook to 18.75% from 18.5% due to performance to-date, E3 progress, and favorable mix from award timing. Margins will step back in the fourth quarter due to increased supply chain delays along with mix effects and new earlier stage programs, but still, strong progress for the full year.  From segment perspective, we've improved the outlook for each with CS above the prior midpoint of its range and IMS, SAS and AS above the top end of their prior ranges. On EPS, we're raising the lower end of the prior guide by $0.05 to $12.85 to $13 per share, reflecting 11% growth from 2020 at the midpoint. Delivering on our double-digit aspiration in spite of dilution from divestitures and supply chain headwinds, which otherwise would have put us at or above the top end. As shown on slide 11, the midpoint is now at 1293, that's $0.55 from improvement in operations in other items, including the release of contingencies, offset, additional divested earnings above $0.03 and $0.49 from supply chain delays.  As mentioned previously, we continue to expect about $0.15 of net dilution from divestitures. Moving to free cash flow, our guide of 2.8 to 2.9 remains intact. However, due to prior divestiture, headwinds and now supply chain delays of over a $150 million in the aggregate, we'll likely be toward the lower end. On working capital, we expect to end the year in the low 50s in terms of days, reflecting a 3 to 5 day sequential improvement in the fourth quarter. And Capex is now expected to be around $350 million, about $15 million lower versus the prior expectation, primarily from completed divestitures.  Lastly, our guidance now reflects approximately $3.6 billion in share repurchases, an increase of $200 million from our prior guide to account for net proceeds from recently closed divestitures. None of these puts and takes were in a position to deliver free cash flow per share in the double-digits in 2021. Okay, let me make a few comments on 2022. The L3Harris business fundamentals are sound and we continue to succeed in our strategy of moving up the value chain to capture more prime positions on core, and adjacent applications. Examples include our leadership positions in space missile tracking, ISR aircraft machinization, DOD, and international soldier modernization, undersea sensing, and cyber resiliency. These and others will lead to solid growth for the foreseeable future.  As we look specifically at 2022, we are expecting supply chain impacts to persist into the first half of next year with recovery starting in the back half. As visibility improves over the coming months, we will provide a more comprehensive update on these expectations in January. For now, we are expecting some of the shortfall to be covered by the end of next year and we'll monitor other watch items, including the timing of awards, vaccine mandates, and tax rules.  Having said that, we remain focused on delivering sustainable revenue growth, steady to rising margins, and leading cash flow conversion on a declining share count. So to sum it all up, we've managed the pandemic related headwinds for seventh straight quarter, and delivered strong bottom line performance, and remain on track to meet our commitments for the year and beyond in a dynamic environment. With that, Rob, let's open up the line for questions. Sure. Thanks, Chris. And just to follow up on that and maybe just a little bit more color on next year when you think about low to mid-single-digit framework for next year. What I'll do is I'll maybe just take you around the horn of our segments. And I think Chris said it well, as far as broad growth across the portfolio. I'll start with IMS. And this year, we had a guide of 4-6, we've said it will be probably towards the upper end this year. And we see a lot of the same going into 2022 that we've seen here in 2021. The ISR business has been a strong grower force behind the back of international aircraft mechanization. We will see fewer aircraft procurement inputs next year, but that will be more than offset by the ramp in actual throughput related to mechanization in aircraft.  You may recall that Chris, in the second quarter call, talked about 19 aircraft in various stages of mechanization, so that will be a source of growth for that business. And that business can certainly deliver loaded mid-single-digit growth next year, if not more. On the EO business within IMS, Chris mentioned a few awards Electro Optical sensors for the Navy. We're bullish on that, that will be a source of growth for us next year. And again, very capable of being able to deliver low-to-mid-single digit next year and a final business with an IMS is Maritime. Maritime has had a strong record over the -- really since the merger. And we see more of the same there as well. We talk about the Constellation Class frigate.  We've won some awards on the classified undersea sensors, and we continue to expand our capabilities and applications in maritime and we expect that to deliver to frankly mid to high-single-digit growth next year. And so when you look at that segment in total, it's very well-positioned to do a low to mid-single-digit if not more. When you look at space in Air Boeing systems, very similar. We continue to expect space to grow as it did this year. And so you would see something in the -- maybe in the range of mid-to-high single-digits growth there. Same thing with Intel & Cyber. We continue to see growth and demand in declassified areas of both of those businesses.  That will be tempered a bit by our airborne businesses we've seen this year that the transition, particularly mission avionics and on the F-35 from development to production, we'll see that again next year, as well as some program transitions on the electronic warfare, particularly in the F16 program. But nonetheless, even with a flattish to slightly down business in the airborne, we'll see Space and Intel carry that segment forward, very easily, being able to deliver something like in the low to mid-single digits. And I'll go next to maybe AS, and the remaining businesses that we have there. The commercial aero business has moved pretty much in line with the commercial aerospace industry.  We continue to expect our traffic growth next year and we expect that business to grow in line with that. You can expect to see some double-digit growth in that business. Mission networks, Chris mentioned the Australia award that will be a source of growth for us next year. And again, really in the low to mid-single-digit range there. And in our Defense Aviation, it's seeing a little bit of delays related to war timing. But even with a flat projection for next year, that business can deliver -- the segment can deliver low-to-mid-single-digit growth. And then finally CS. And we've talked about SATCOM the supply chain pressures there. This year that that business will be. Now about 10.  And we see if we think about SATCOM, we expect growth even next year off the lower base that we have this year. This year we're going to be impacted in the third and the fourth quarter. We expect to be impacted again in the first and second quarter, we recover the back half. With that recovering the back half, we believe that business can grow in that low to mid-single-digit baseline from this year. And it's really similar with the BCS business, our broadband business, our integrated vision solutions business, and PSPC, which will also just benefit from industry recovery. And so as Chris mentioned, again, I'll close with that.  We really see a broad-based growth in a low to mid-single-digit initial framework is the right way to look at it, really across the portfolio. One last thing, Chris mentioned about $800 million. On a reported basis, we'll see about $800 million of revenue headwind due to the divestitures of next year. But again, starting with the organic, really low-to-mid-single-digit is probably the best place for us to be until we solidify our expectations and we'll do that in January for you. Hopefully that went around the horn and gave you some color within each of the segments, and really give you the source of why we feel confident in our gaining confidence and our ability to deliver that type of growth. Good morning. Sure. Just maybe a couple of other items that we're pretty focused on, Rob. Obviously, I think we're probably no different than others in terms of making longer term commitments, our 12, 18, 24 months in certain cases. We've redeployed resources to make sure we're managing this at lower tiers in the electronic component value chain. And we speak secure alternative sources as well as alternative parts and qualify them. We were redesigning parts in products and electronic components to really ensure that we can have adequate sources supply going into next year. And we're making crop progress across each of these areas, which again is why we're gaining confidence that we'll be able to grow in this business next year.  As far as supply chain specifically, supply-chain escalation is certainly going to be a cost for us when we think about 2022. Right now the I'm thinking about is about 25 basis points of margin pressure associated with escalation costs. I would say that that's something that we were considering, that's something that we've got baked in, and that's something that will be part of our plans to deliver on our E3 productivity. Our goal will be as it always is, to offset the headwinds from mix, as well as supply chain, and deliver at least flat margins, if not higher. The next year will be no different. The pressure is going to be a little bit higher but nonetheless, we believe that we're going to have a solid path to be able to offset it. And your question on $3 billion of free cash flow, for us to the formula really remains the same. We need to deliver annually, I'm including next year, about 3 to 4 days reduction in working capital. And that will offset the growth that otherwise would take place in working capital from just increased use of assets. And so we're able to do that. We should be able to at least hold the working capital flat if not become a source of income, or source of cash flow and then we can have that added to drag drop-through of net income. And so really remains the same as far as our working capital. When you go back and look, we've got we ended the quarter at 56 days. We've got seven sectors who are above that average, which comprises about 2/3 of our working capital. A lot of that is sitting in inventory, and we've talked about this in the past. And we're really, you know, again, it's just blocking and tackling, focusing on fundamentals as far as inventory reduction. This include things like just ensure that we execute against our program milestones. We're synchronizing our forecasting and planning with our supply chain.  We'll continue to work and Chris mentioned it on cycle time reductions in automations in the factory, as well as just negotiating better turns of our contracts, getting more advances where we're looking maybe compare to some of our other peers. Their percentage of advance is a little bit higher than ours, and so that creates an opportunity for us to ensure that we can match cash receipts with cash disbursements on the inventory side. So we're opportunity rich here, 2/3 of our working capital is prime for us to continue to work down. We feel good about that. And look from a free cash flow per share, we're very confident in double-digit growth there for the foreseeable future. Yeah. Maybe just a little bit. Chris mentioned, I think in his remarks as well as far as a Middle East customer. What we have here, these are $1 billion plus type opportunities with this Middle East customer as well as the U.K. and Australia. And what we've been able to do in each case is when front-end type of contracts. And so right now with this particular country we won about 5,000 radios, that could be potential up to 50,000 radios over a number of years. And so being on the front end will position us well for that longer-term opportunity. The same thing goes with the U.K. We just want an opportunity to do tech refresh on current radios. Net positions as well, for what could be it also another opportunity of 50,000 radios, billion-dollar plus program.  If similarly, Australia you're looking at potentially 35,000 radios. In our ballpark, we also want an opportunity there to do some crypto monetization on installed base. And so winning these early awards puts us in positions j us t very well for these long-term large programs in each of these countries, we've got a DoD opportunity coming up on either this quarter or next quarter with the marine corps. We feel confident in our positioning there and our products offering for that. And so we're confident and bullish about the opportunities for the Tactical Radio business going forward in our positioning as well. Yeah. Just on Q4, as you mentioned, we will see some just newer awards which have lower margins on it. And then the Tactile Communication business steps down in Q4, so I'll put pressure on the margins from a business mix perspective. And so that's really the driver for Q4. Good morning."

Welcome to the L3Harris Technologies, Second Quarter Calendar Year 2021 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today are Chris Kubasik, our CEO and Jay Malave, our CFO. First, a few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our press release, presentation and SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP comparable measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. With that Chris, I'll turn it over to you.\nChris Kubasik: Well, thank you Rajeev and good morning everyone. I\u2019d like to thank the entire L3Harris team for a job well done as we began our third year as a new company. We are executing the integration plan and have exceeded many of our targets despite challenges such as the pandemic. The high performance culture and leadership team we've created are set to carry this momentum forward, which is reflected in today's results. We reported a strong second quarter, organic revenue was up over 6% with growth across our key end markets and all four business segments. Funded book-to-bill was 1.0 for the quarter and 1.05 year-to-date. Margins increased to 18.6% resulting in EPS of $3.26, up 15%. We had solid free cash flow of $685 million, which contributed to shareholder returns above $1 billion, including repurchases of $850 million in the quarter and over $1.5 billion year-to-date. Our first half performance coupled with our expectations for continued execution in the back half more than offset the divestiture headwinds and supports another raise to our EPS guidance which Jay will cover.  Execution against our strategic priorities that are on slide three continue to deliver results and create value for the company's stakeholders as we make progress and build momentum with top line opportunities, operational performance, announcing and closing divestitures and delivering on our capital return commitments.  In terms of the top line, we are at our best quarter since the start of the pandemic, with progress against our key end market growth objectives while seeing data points that validate our focused R&D strategy. Our government businesses were up 6% in the second quarter, driven by double digit growth internationally.  Our international revenue benefited from increased aircraft ISR and radio sales to regions in the Asia Pacific and Europe. And on the domestic front, the growth was broad based with our responsive space and maritime programs, as well as land modernization for night vision and SATCOM products leading the way.  Our strategy to deliver end-to-end mission solutions utilizing the capabilities and scale across the broader organization continues to gain momentum. Our space business strategy is working as we grew 10% in the quarter, capturing classified awards totaling over $300 million for ground and responsive satellite solutions. These awards are also part of the revenue synergy capture efforts and bring awards to-date to over $700 million on a win rate of 70% from our growing $7 billion plus pipeline.  Turning to our commercial aerospace and public safety businesses, they were up over 5% in aggregate, and were led by our commercial aerospace business, up double digits off a low base, and from strength in product sales. On the public safety side, there was a modest decline, but with sequential improvement and increased bid in proposal activity from a more stable backdrop.  Our solid top line was accompanied by backlog growth, as we continue to win strategic programs that includes several pride roles. Backlog increased 7% organically year-over-year to over $20 billion with notable award activity across all domains.  On the space side our revenue synergy awards came from combining electronics and optics capabilities across the company to deliver solutions for an increasingly contested environment. These are incremental to the pathfinder finder programs we previously won, which have billions of dollars of potential over time. Customers are viewing L3Harris as a trusted disrupter. They see us as a company that understands the complexity of the mission and can offer fresh and creative solutions. With a three year space pipeline of nearly $20 billion, there is more opportunity for continued growth.  Within the air domain, we strengthened our existing F-35 franchise with initial production awards for the Aircraft Memory System and the Panoramic Cockpit Display Electronic Unit under the TR3 program. This brings total orders year-to-date on the platform to about $500 million. We're progressing on all three TR3 systems through integration and qualification this year and in support of the planned of Lot 15 cut-in of the production hardware. We have also secured a roughly $100 million IDIQ with SOCOM for infrared EO Sensors on Rotary platforms, furthering our modernization opportunities across L3Harris.  Moving over to the land side, we signed several key contracts that touched both international and domestic markets. First, we received a $3.3 billion five year IDIQ for foreign military sales, to a range of partner countries from our new broader portfolio of products, including radios and SATCOM terminals. This replaces our prior 5 year $1.7 billion contract, which supports and validates the continued modernization across geographies and expands our product scope.  Second, in the UK we received a logistics support contract covering Legacy Bowman and future MORPHEUS radios, positioning us well for $1 billion modernization opportunity in that country. And third, we won a competitive 10 year IDIQ to supply the U.S. Air Force with our T7 Multi Mission Robots, further expanding our customer reach. After launching the T7 with the UK a few years back, we are now pursuing other international opportunities in the robotic area.  Within the sea domain, our team was successful in extending its leading prime position in undersea sensor systems and warfare training for a range of the U.S. Navy platforms and support of distributed maritime operations. This Undersea Warfare training range program called USWTR has an award value of nearly $400 million and further builds our credibility to pursue additional domestic and international opportunities.  In the cyber domain, while limiting to what we can say due to the classified nature, our $1 billion Intel and Cyber business received over 250 million in orders for complex mission solutions and specialized communications for both domestic and international markets, leading to another quarter of book-to-bill above 1.0 for this business. We also had a key award in an adjacent market with our public safety business, with a 15 year $450 million contract from the state of Florida to upgrade and continue operating its law enforcement system for first responders.  Moving over to the budgets, while the process is ongoing, and we await to file up [ph] we were pleased with the initial request for the FY 22 budget as a support stability in the DoD, NASA and FAA spending and is aligned with our capabilities and investment priorities. For the DoD, it's focused on continuing to revolve around and address near peer threats, through high value technology which Congress is revealing, and when we look at the portfolio and the relevant line items, our programs are well supported.  This builds on the trend we've seen in international markets, where there's a broad stability in military spending, including key countries such as the UK, Australia, Canada, Japan amongst others. We are also seeing growing demand for the type of defensive systems we offer for our alignment with the U.S. Export policies to ensure partner security.  Our most significant opportunities remain for ISR aircraft missionization and other upgrades, land force modernization and enhanced Maritime Systems. All-in-all, as we consider the trajectory of our top line over the coming years, we remain confident in our ability to outgrow the budget and deliver sustainable growth through our domestic positioning, revenue synergies and international expansion to drive a large pipeline of opportunities underpinned by our leading R&D investments.  Shifting to operational performance, we continue to surpass milestones for priority programs. For example, at SAS the team completed a successful preliminary design review for an advanced EW solution called Viper Shield that can deliver self-protection capability for Block 70 F-16.  At IMS we advanced our unmanned Maritime Strategy with several customer engagements and demonstrations, highlighting differentiators and predictive autonomy on USVs, as well as a submerged torpedo tube launch and recovery for our small UUVs. We also successfully completed a prototype demonstration for a SOCOM Multirole aircraft in a variety of challenging conditions, while utilizing the breadth of L3 Harris offerings.  And financially, we had another quarter of strong margins as the team continues to offset mixed impacts from early stage programs with three e3 initiatives, including program excellence and factory productivity, allowing us to flow through cost synergies totaling an incremental $27 million in the quarter.  In addition, the first half synergy run rate is now $350 million, driven by progress on facilities, consolidation and IT efficiencies. We see this as the minimum level we'll deliver on this year, up from the $320 million to $350 million range we discussed in April and still a year ahead of schedule. Any the upside from here will be incorporated in our e3 programs, with our integration efforts blending into operational excellence initiatives. Our margins for the year, this leaves us at about 18.5% for the top hand of the prior guide and a level we\u2019ll look to build on in the years ahead.  Next, on capital allocation, today we announced the sale of two small businesses within our Aviation Systems segment for $185 million in cash, and these should close before year end. When combined with the roughly $2.5 billion divested under our portfolio shaping initiative, total gross proceeds are set to be $2.7 billion. We have now divested nearly 10% of our revenues and with the completion of a few others in process, our portfolio shaping program announced in 2019 is largely complete.  Proceeds from divestitures including those from the recently completed military training and combat propulsion businesses will be part of our capital returns program, consistent with our shareholder friendly capital allocation approach. Our expectation now is for buybacks to be roughly $3.4 billion this year, up versus our prior guide of $2.3 billion. When combined with dividends, capital returns will be about $4.2 billion in 2021.  So to wrap up, I'm pleased with the execution against our strategic priorities, confident in our ability to consistently deliver double digit EPS and double digit free cash flow per share growth, and I'm excited about the next phase for L3Harris.  With that, I'll hand it over to Jay. \nJay Malave : Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. First, I'll provide more color on the quarter. I'll cover also the segment results and finish with our updated outlook.  Starting with the second quarter, organic revenue was up 6.2% with a return to growth in all four segments. IMS led the way up 12%, followed by a return to growth at AS of 4.7%. Margins expanded 40 basis points to 18.6%, primarily from e3 productivity, program performance and integration benefits, partially offset by higher R&D. The sequential decline in margin was also due to timing of R&D as expected.  These drivers, along with our share repurchases led to EPS being up 15% up $0.43 to $3.26 as shown on slide five. Of this growth, volume, synergies and operations contributed $0.18; a lower share count contributed another $0.18 and pension tax and interest accounted for the remaining $0.07.  Free cash flow was $685 million, while working capital days stood at 57 due to receivables timing. And shareholder returns of over $1 billion were comprised of $850 million in share repurchases, and $207 million in dividends. Of note, our last 12 months of share repurchases have totaled over $3 billion at an average price of $195 per share, well below our current share price.  Now, turning to the quarterly segment results on slide six. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was up 12%, led by double digit growth in ISR aircraft missionization on a recently awarded NATO program. In addition to mid-single digit growth in maritime from a ramp on key platforms, including the Virginia Class submarine and Constellation Class frigate.  This more than offset the low single digit decline in our Electro Optical business that was due to the timing of WESCAM turret deliveries, which we expect to increase in the back half. Operating income was up 2%, while margins contracted 150 basis points to 15.3%, reflecting expected mixed impacts, including a ramp on growth platforms and programs. Funded book-to-bill was 0.81 in the quarter and 1.06 for the first half with strength across the segment.  In Space & Airborne, organic revenue increased 3.2% from our missile defense and other responsive programs, driving 10% growth in space, along with mid-single digit classified growth in Intel and cyber.  This strength outweighed the impact from modernization program transitions in our airborne businesses. We have 35 Tech Refresh 3 program within eight Mission Avionics and F-16 Viper Shield Advanced Electronic Warfare System.  Operating income was up 7.7% and margins expanded 90 basis points to 19.7% as operational excellence, including program performance, increased pension income and integration benefits more than offset higher R&D investments, and funded book-to-bill was over one for both the quarter and first half, driven by space.  Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was up 3.2% with mid-single digit growth in Tactical Communications, that included international up double digits, driven primarily by modernization demand from Asia Pacific and Europe, and an anticipated decline in DoD from last year's second quarter, 40% plus growth.  U.S. DoD modernization continued to benefit the integrated vision in global communication businesses leading to high single digit and double digit growth respectively. Conversely, broadband was down low single digits on lower volume for legacy unmanned platforms due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments as expected. And public safety was down 7% from residual pandemic related impacts.  Operating income was up 8.3% and margins expanded 170 basis points to 25.5% from higher volume, operational excellence, and integration benefits, and funded book-to-bill in the quarter and first half grew by 1.3 and 1.1 respectively.  Finally, in Aviation Systems, organic revenue increased 4.7%, driven primarily by our commercial aerospace business that was up 20% from recovering training and air transport OEM product sales. We also saw a mid-single digit growth in defense aviation from a ramp on fusing inordinance programs and in mission networks from higher FAA volume.  Operating income was up 17% and margins expanded 200 basis points to 14.5% from operational excellence, integration benefits and higher volume. Funded book-to-bill was about 0.9 for the quarter and first half.  Okay, shifting over to our 2021 outlook. Overall, organic revenue growth is unchanged at 3% to 5% with our top line trending as expected at 4% for the first half and supported by a 1.05 funded book-to-bill year-to-date. Our U.S. Government businesses are expected to accelerate in the back half driven by Space, Tactical Communications, Integrated Vision Solutions and Classified Growth within Intel and Cyber and Defense Aviation.  On the international side we continue to expect mid-single digit plus growth for the year, as a strong first half, led by aircraft ISR and international Tactical Radios moderates. And lastly, the encouraging results in our commercial businesses in the second quarter build confidence in a flattish outlook for the year with double digit growth in the back half.  Consistent with our overall guide at the consolidated level, we also maintained our segment sales guide as well. And as we think about the second half of the year, our key watch items will be the timing of awards, the continued performance of our supply chain, and the pace of the commercial recovery.  Turning to margins, we have raised our outlook to approximately 18.5%, a 25 basis point increase to the top end of the previous range due to our strong performance to-date and confidence in our ability to execute on cost synergies, e3 and program deliverables. We do continue to expect margins to have moved lower in the back half due to higher R&D investment and stronger growth on new, earlier stage programs.  From a segment perspective, we are holding to our prior margin guidance ranges across the board, but we're expecting IMS and SAS to be at the upper end of their ranges given their strong performance to-date and are holding AS and CS steady at their midpoints given divestiture dilution at AS and expected mix pressure at CS.  On EPS, we're raising our full year guide to a range of $12.80 to $13, with the midpoint now toward the upper end of our previous range and reflecting 11% growth from 2020, delivering on our double digit commitment in spite of dilution from divestitures.  As shown on slide 11, the increase of $0.05 from the prior midpoint is driven by $0.13 improvement in operations and synergies and 0.19% from a lower share count at 203 million shares, along with a lower tax rate of about 16%, all of which more than offset divested earnings of $0.31. On a standalone basis we expect about $0.15 of net dilution from divestitures.  Moving to free cash flow, our guide of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion is intact, despite divestiture related headwinds of roughly $80 million and continues to reflect the three day working capital improvement from year-end to around 49 to 50 days, that\u2019s now adjusted for divestitures. CapEx is expected to be about $365 million, $10 million lower versus the prior guide due to completed divestitures.  Our guidance also now reflects approximately $3.4 billion in share repurchases, an increase of $1.1 billion from our prior guide to account for net proceeds from recently closed divestitures. All told, we expect to return about $4.2 billion to shareholders this year. So let me sum it all up. We delivered strong performance in the quarter and first half, solid revenue and book-to-bill growth. Further expansion of industry leading margins and consistent cash generation and deployment, all enabling another guide raise as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities and drive double digit annual growth in earnings and free cash flow per share.  With that Rob, let's open up the line for questions. \nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. \nDoug Harned: Good morning. Thank you.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning, Doug. \nDoug Harned: I wanted to understand a little more about the outlook for Communication Systems. I mean you already had strong growing positions on Radio Monetization and Night Vision, and then you got some big awards in Q2 and those should add to growth and I would expect this should be high margin as well. And so, when you look at the longer term growth here, look at the revenue trajectory over the next three to five years, how do you see that now? And is there potential to take margins up above their current 25% levels here? \nChris Kubasik: Yes Doug, this is Chris. Thanks for the question, and yes, you absolutely got it right. We've been quite successful in the Communication Segment of late with some of those wins not only here domestically but internationally as well. So I think what we're seeing is some upward pressure for revenue growth and margins over the longer term, like we've talked about before. We had a great quarter when you looked at the book-to-bill, and the continuation for modernization of the land force is, whether it's the radios, the night vision goggles, SATCOM we're really in a good, position. So maybe I'll throw it over to Jay to give you a little more color. \nJay Malave : Sure. Just a \u2013 maybe just another quick comment on revenue growth over the medium term, Doug. If you recall and if you look at the future, it's somewhat similar to what we have this year. If you look at our segments, we had SAS at four to six, IMS at four to six and now it\u2019s followed by CS and AS. If you look to the future, we would expect those two segments to continue to be leaders in growth. I will say as Chris mentioned, if this gives us more confidence in the CS outlook, we probably expect those two to drive a little higher growth than CS in the medium term.  On the margin profile, see, this year we are taking \u2013 from the first half we are going back a little bit and that's really a reflection of the mix on the new programs. We have the army, the HMS Monetization programs, we also have in our broadband communication, the Next Gen Jammer Program, so that\u2019s some pretty sizable programs that are actually margin dilutive. The good thing about that is the CMS track record being able to take cost out, drive the margins better over time.  So if you look at the first half that shows you what the potential of the segment could be, and so when we end the year this year we'll be in that say 24% -- right now we're saying 24.5% at the midpoint. We delivered over 25% in the first half of the year, that gives you kind of a view of what the medium term could look like over time. \nChris Kubasik: And I'll just chime in there. Yesterday we signed a contract with the Mid-East country for the first phase of a multi-year Next Gen STR standardization program, and this has the potential for up to $1 billion over the next several years, so a lot of good positive momentum. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please with your question. \nKristine Liwag: Hey! Good morning, guys. \nChris Kubasik: Good morning. \nKristine Liwag: Chris, in Space, can you provide more color on the competitive landscape, the available programs for bid and how you're performing? \nChris Kubasik: Oh absolutely! Now we've had a good run in space and as I mentioned, you know we had a good quarter book-to-bill in space was 1.2 so far this year and we've been successful in winning 10 of 18 prime positions just in the last 18 months. So that's something that we're quite proud of and we've also moved into the missile defense arena.  So, maybe a little longer answer. The approach we're taking in space is similar to what we've done in all five domains, and it's really understanding the customers\u2019 mission. We have 47,000 employees and 20,000 engineers and 20,000 employees with clearances.  So we are looking at our capabilities, we're looking at how we are spending our IRAD and we are trying to develop solutions and alternatives that meet their needs. We've talked a lot in the past as you know about our responsive SATs, where we were able to develop and launch satellites within twenty months. So that's helping us win a lot of these prime positions. We understand the mission, we have innovative solutions. The focus is on the payload and the integration and speed. So strategically, I think that has been a needle mover. When I look at the exquisite satellites, you know we continue to have some of the best payloads out there, so we're working with partners, usually the larger prime and that's contributed to some success and we have some awards coming up in the next few months that are classified. And then we're working collaboratively with some of these new entrants, just like we do with the traditional primes and find where we can partner, where we can compete, and it seems to be working. So very proud of that team and the outlook is quite positive in space and the budget is clearly supporting this growth as well. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. \nDavid Strauss: Hi! Thanks, good morning. \nChris Kubasik: Good morning. \nDavid Strauss: Chris, I just wanted to ask about the margin side. You're hinting at the idea for further margin upside from here. Can you just talk about the different drivers you see? How much of the margin upside that you see from here is dependent on volume versus kind of what's under your own control from an e3 perspective? And then also what you're assuming for pension when you say higher margins from there guidance? \nChris Kubasik: Well, thanks David. I mean a small part of the margin improvement does come from volume and you know we've talked about organic growth trajectory, so that's a contributor. But the big driver is ultimately e3, and we talked about the synergies which are a year ahead of schedule and we're committed to a $350 million run rate.  A lot of this takes more than just the two or three years that we've talked about, and each and every function is developed and executing a transformation plan. It takes investments sometimes in systems and processes, but we believe there's continual upside. We've proven it, we're focused on this, something Jay and I review on a regular basis.  So we see no reason why the e3 program can't continue. I'll let Jay jump in on the pension assumptions, but again, the execution has been what's helpful and driving the margins. We're able to control our EACs and the commitments that we sign up to with our customers.  So Jay, a little more color. \nJay Malave: Yes, sure. Just to confirm right on the margins, the absorption is a little benefit. That's typically factored in when we talk about the mix headwinds and that\u2019s usually coming in these new programs with thinner margins.  As Chris mentioned, e3 is the key driver. It\u2019s going to drive us and talked about 20 to 25 basis points per year over the medium term of being able to continue to drive expansion and we feel pretty confident in that.  The pension, if you think about this year, all-in between FAS and CAS is benefited of about $470 million on an absolute basis. We expect that next year the CAS element to decline a little bit as a result to the ARPU legislation, it was an enacted earlier in the year. As that pushed out funding requirements for pension our recovery for CAS will come down a little bit, but that should be offset by some FAS income. So net-net I would expect the year-over-year pension to be pretty much flat. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning. \nChris Kubasik: Good morning. \nRobert Stallard: Chris, this is probably one for you. You mentioned that the disposal process is now pretty much done. I was wondering how the prices on the assets that you sold have compared versus your expectations, and do we now see maybe a shift in strategy and perhaps start to look again at acquisitions? Thank you. \nChris Kubasik: Well, thank you for the question. Now we've had numerous transactions that comprise the $2.7 billion. You know I went back and looked at our original estimates and we've generally answered your question and have been able to meet or in some cases slightly exceed what we had projected. You know we talked way back about maybe about $2.8 billion of gross proceeds from all these divestitures where 2.7 and as I mentioned a couple of small ones. So we'll clearly get within the range of our expectations.  You know on the M&A front, we did come out of the box two years ago and said we really were going to stand down on M&A and focus on the integration and the divestitures, and as I've highlighted that's gone very well or maybe even better than expected. But even during that two year period we watched the market. I'm highly confident we didn't miss anything in the two year period. So we'll continue to survey the market where we're looking at anything that is \u201ca must have\u201d as we call it.  You know when I look at the portfolio, as we said over the two years, we're in all five domains. I don't really see any glaring needs or gaps. So we'll either proactively approach companies or respond to inbound calls, but we're really going to continue to hold the discipline, look at things strategically, look at them operationally, make sure the financial hurdles make sense. So not really in a rush and very pleased with what we've been able to win organically. So, hopefully that that gives you some insight Robert and we'll let you know as things progress. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Please proceed with your question. \nMyles Walton: Hey, good morning. I was wondering if you could comment a bit on the second half implied to sit down in SAS margins. I think you talked in the past about R&D and mix, maybe just quantify those. And also Chris or Jay, could you just update us on Next Generation Jammer? I know the second protest has been you know \u2013 or is being adjudicated I guess by GAO and I guess that's due for a decision here in the next couple of weeks. Would that have a swing factor on this year's top line or guidance in anyway? \nChris Kubasik: Yes, I'll take the Next Gen Jammer one first of then ask Jay to chime in on SAS. No, you're right. It's going to be mid-August when we hear the results. We're very supportive and confident and in the process that the U.S. Navy ran and we're assuming that we began work in August and that's built within the model and the guidance. So no additional upside from that, but a huge win and we're looking forward to getting started and delivering those capabilities. \nJay Malave: And on the SAS margins Myles, you know this make about \u2013 the first half, about 19.5% in that ballpark. The back half of the year does step down to 18%, maybe 18% plus in the guidance range at the high end of 18.75%.  The key driver is really mixed on the new programs, particularly in Space. We've got to step up on these missile defense programs. There's a number of other classified programs that we've already won and that you know we anticipate winning here in the back half of the year, which will continue to put some pressure on the margins in the back half. But again, those are things that we had contemplated coming into the year when we set the guide originally and we're pretty impressed by the fact we're able to go to the high end of the guide now based on these same new programs. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. \nRichard Safran: Hey, good morning everybody. How are you? \nA - Chris Kubasik: Good morning. Fine! How are you doing? \nRichard Safran: Great! You know the international market for defense is always dynamic and I thought I'd follow-up on some of your opening remarks here. Could you give us an update in the overall international outlook, the opportunity set where you're seeing demand coming from and for what types of systems, you know, etc.  Can you answer, Chris, you have this reputation with being able to drive and improve relationships with government customers, and I was just wondering in your answer, if you could discuss where you see the opportunities for L3Harris.\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Well, there's a lot of questions there. I'll go backwards. Yeah, I mean I try to encourage my team that we got to spend time with our customers and listen to their challenges and such. So, actually this evening I'll be headed to DC and have three days of meetings in the Pentagon with a whole variety of customers from OSD and the single services and obviously bring in the key P&L leaders with me. So we like to listen to our customers and see how we can help them and work collaboratively with them on the budget process and such, so. I think everybody does it, but that's something I'm focused on.  International, you know we came out of the shoot and said, this was one of the areas we thought we could do better and I think we said we were underperforming as a combined company, and we were probably right around 19% of our revenue, maybe 20% on a pro form basis back in 29 \u2013 or 2019. So far this year we're at about 22% of our revenue coming from international. So we're seeing a little positive movement. As you it\u2019s a little lumpy.  You know as I mentioned, you know maybe somewhat surprising, the budgets have really been stable across the globe consistent with the U.S. So I think that was a pleasant surprise given the threat environment and you think of U.K., Australia, Japan, Canada and so our approach and strategy that I've talked about is really two-fold. We have the ten focus countries where we have executives, either local country national or ex-pats there day-to-day, understanding the process, the threats and bringing in our P&L leaders, at least when the border is opened to try to close on deals.  So that seems to be working well and then more on the traditional product side, you know we use the distributors and the reps and we've been able to use previous relationships to expand the portfolio. You know I mentioned that IDIQ for FMS you know as an example. That now allows all the products of the new company to come through, not just the traditional radio. So, I think that's a positive.  You know a lot of what we do is focused on more defensive systems we're hearing from our international customers, because ultimately they want situational awareness and the ability to communicate in a contested environment. So you know I look at our portfolio and the things we're doing on ISR aircraft, whether it's something like a rivet joint to a business jet, and in some cases to a single prop aircraft.  We have a broad portfolio that allows them to get situational awareness. We've talked quite about \u2013 a bit about our resilient comps capability, our Waveforms library, which is second to none and you know relative to the regions it\u2019s the usual place, the Mid East, the Far East and Asia Pacific and we're seeing growth opportunities in all those areas.  So that's probably a longer answer than you wanted, but we're optimistic and I think we're in a good position and executing on the strategy we laid out two years ago. \nJay Malave: And just to quickly add to that Richard, you know our growth framework we had laid out a target of mid-single digit plus growth over the medium term for international, so we are comfortable with that. Obviously we're going to be doing that this year if not a little bit better. And as kind of what Chris said, some of these capabilities, the ISR aircraft missionization, if you recall back in our March investor briefing, we've talked about taking the exquisite Rivet Joint capability. Bringing that to business chat is also bringing it to pod capability based on customer affordability, and there\u2019s a significant amount of demand around the world for that.  You look at Tactical Communications, we see a lot of these foreign countries following the same DoD modernization path and so we see opportunities there. And I'd say the other areas is maritime, both in manned and unmanned, you know request for support in the capabilities we would provide, both in say electrical distribution and power control, as well as things like autonomy. So we just continue to see a growing pipeline and we're pretty comfortable with that growth objective over the medium term. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please proceed with your question. \nGautam Khanna: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys. \nChris Kubasik: Good morning. \nGautam Khanna: I wanted to ask just a follow-up to an earlier question on RF tactical and sort of the prospects for growth in \u201822 and beyond. Maybe if you could frame for us the international and domestic pipeline and then what did you expect kind of rates of growth to be beyond this year? And then I have a follow-up on IVAS. If you can talk about what your view of that program is as a potential threat or opportunity for the legacy addition? Thank you. \nChris Kubasik: Okay. Let me do high level on the first question and Jay can give you some more color on Tac Com and then I'll come back and answer the IVAS question.  So specifically domestically we've talked about some upcoming awards that should be occurring here domestically, the HMS Manpack, HMS Leader, those are coming forward here, hopefully in the third quarter. You know in the fourth quarter the marines have a handheld competition that we're also looking forward to getting to results.  Then of course internationally we have a pretty good increase here later in the year and again, the focus there is going to be in Europe, the Mid East and Asia, the Asia Pacific region. Again, we've had good success in the Mid East that I just mentioned from yesterday, some Australian orders and really a pretty strong pipeline. But I\u2019ll let Jay give you a little more color in numbers as it relates to Tac Com.\nJay Malave: Yeah Gautam, you know I think overall probably in both cases, both DoD and international you're looking at probably low to mid-single digit growth over the medium term. Part of the reason particularly in DoD is that while we have strong growth on the modernization programs, it does cannibalize a piece of our base business and so you have a little bit of a reduction there with growth, solid growth on the monetization programs, Army being the largest program, that's really in the early innings and we've got the start of full rate production here coming in the back half of this year. Internationally Chris mentioned that before, there\u2019s just demand around the world for some significant upgrades as far as modernization, but again I would put the growth rate right now in that low to mid-single digit as new countries come on, other countries fall off and so you know obviously we\u2019re going to drive that to more of a mid-single digit, but for now I think it's the best way to think about and look at it. \nChris Kubasik: Going back to IVAS, you know I think when you look at our ENVG-B program and IVAS, I would say that you're kind of going head-to-head and maybe battling a little bit for budget money although both were funded and you know our focus is clearly to deliver, which our team has done a great job on schedule and meet all of our commitments. I think ultimately its going to be a question of how these get split. I think there's several hundred thousand devices needed and they have slightly different capabilities and mission sets. So I would think over time there's going to be a split between the two. You know we've been talking a little more publicly about some of the augmented reality capabilities within the ENVG-B, you know the real focus on the night vision capabilities. So different capabilities, different mission and you know I would think the two converge at some point and we'll see how the army wants to play that out. But right now we're just focused on delivering and making sure we meet our commitments. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hey! Good morning guys, thank you for the time. On IMS, maybe can you talk about some of that deceleration you're seeing, you're forecasting 5% growth for the year, and you got 9% robust growth in the first half and it implies flat for the second half, so what are some of the puts and takes?\nA - Chris Kubasik: Yes Sheila, what's happening with IMS in the back half of the year is we had strong growth in the ISR business, which was mostly these international customers. That will moderate and abate a little bit here in the second half of the year, and so the growth rate is just going to normalize back to what we are expecting really for the full year, that's really the key driver, really strong international in the first half that moderates really in the second half for the business back to a normal rate. \nA - Jay Malave: Yeah, I think of all of our segment Sheila, this one you know is a little more lumpy based on the large significant procurements of aircraft or deliveries and so you kind of get these up and down quarters, but I'd much rather be coming out of the chute strong than having a fourth quarter hockey stick. So you know that's what happens in IMS, mainly in the ISR sector. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Spingarn: Hi! Good morning. \nChris Kubasik: Good morning. \nRob Spingarn: You know Chris, it's kind of funny how things change because now we're actually reading about commercial pilot shortages and I think Jay talked about recovering training sales, but I'm curious if you can quantify how big the increase was, either year-over-year or sequentially and what the latest overall recovery expectation is and whether or not this business is core or non-core. Thanks. \nA - Chris Kubasik: Right Rob, great questions. We did see some good recovery, double digit in the second quarter driven a little more by the products and the actual training. I think there's a slight lag there. You know we have a variety of training models from academies you know where the cadets actually come into our facilities for an 18, 12 to 18 month period. That's been a little challenged due to some of the border closures, so that's a little lagging. I think as the borders open up we'll see an uptick there, of course the delta viruses is coming through on a curved ball in everything compared to what we thought it would be, so the recovery is lagging a little bit. You know the simulators, as you said there's a pilot shortage. People either need to get the training refreshed or a lot of pilots may have retired and there's now going to be some new pilots that are going to need the simulator training. And then of course for the actual manufacturing you know we had a slow start to the year as you would expect, not a lot of people buying simulators, but so far in the third quarter, even though it's early August, we've already been awarded two simulators and we\u2019ll be converting those to contracts here in the next 30 to 45 days.  So we are seeing an uptick and you know it's going to drive growth in the second half. We\u2019re assuming \u2013 I\u2019ll let Jay give the exact numbers, double digit growth in commercial aviation. So it is a good market, it\u2019s got good technology and we're going to continue to run that business and evaluate and determine strategically what we want to do with it. But it's part of the company now and its contributing and we're excited about the uptick, so Jay?\nJay Malave: Yeah, you know we step up in the back half of the year to about 30% growth and in the commercial business from 20% here in the second quarter. This is consistent with what we had expected you know coming into the year. The trends that we've seen or have seen thus far really in the month of July support that and so we've got some pretty good demand and a lot of activity going on in terms of our simulator sales and we\u2019re also seeing just increased leads as far as new cadet training in our academies and we're also seeing it in the simulator training.  You know as Chris mentioned, the one thing to keep an eye on it for us, just that\u2019s more maybe company specific is that we do operate our simulator training in these regions that had been a little bit mixed as far as lockdowns opens up and back \u2013 locked back down and so \u2013 but that's the smallest piece of our business. Overall we're pretty confident with this 30% growth based on what we're saying. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey! Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I don't know if this is Chris or Jay, but is it impossible to quantify you know either kind of this year on the top line organic growth or even breaking down your bookings kind of year-to-date. How much of the growth is coming from new programs and I guess what I'm getting at is what kind of dilution on either new start programs are you trying to offset or deal with, and I guess Gautam kind of hit on it. You know are you seeing any more pricing pressure, competitive pressures from new start commercial players, you know like what we're seeing in the IVAS program. \nA - Chris Kubasik: Yeah Michael, thanks for that. It\u2019s a great, great question. I mean as I said, 6%, 6.2% organic growth. You know when I look at \u2013 as we go through the planning process and build up our annual operating plan, you know we start the year and we usually have pretty good visibility into what's already in backlog, you know so a lot of \u2013 it's kind of in the 70% range as we look forward, so you know going back to December of 2020 when we put out our guidance for \u201921 pretty good visibility, 70%. You know there's maybe 10-ish or so of follow-on.  So you know to answer your question, I guess you could say maybe 15%, maybe 20% at the most is revenue derived from new business to give you some idea. You know on the \u2013 it is driven by new programs or new contracts is kind of how I look at it. And as you suggest, some of those, especially with the DoD start out as cost plus contracts, you know then its migrated into a low rate production, a full rate production. So you know it's no secret that the cost plus margins tend to be lower than what we're currently realizing, so it's dilutive on that front and then even on the fixed price contracts. I think we\u2019re generally pretty conservative in how we start poking those until we retire and mitigate the risk. So maybe that answers your question there. As far as competitive pricing pressures, you know nothing new or different than what we\u2019ve had over the last decade or two in this industry. You know the selection criteria varies by program and I think our customers are very sophisticated and they look at the technical solutions, they look at past performance, they look at the management team, they look at cost, they look at schedule. So you know they are taking all those things into consideration.  Like I said earlier, to an earlier question, we try to find ways to work collaboratively with these new entrants, when and if they can add value and increase our probability of when. So, I don't know, Jay anything further? [Cross Talk] \nJay Malave: Yeah, I mean it varies year-to-year. I'd say on the mix headwind, maybe at a gross level, you're talking anywhere around 25 basis points or so of headwind from year-to-year. And our challenge is really to offset that with about 50 basis points of productivity and so that we have a net 20 to 25 basis points improvement year-to-year. But again just, it will vary. I'd say that it\u2019ll probably be just like an average to think about. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. \nUnidentified Analyst : Hey guys! It's Tyler [ph] on for Seth. Good morning. \nChris Kubasik: Good morning. \nUnidentified Analyst : Just, I have a couple quick ones here. Can you just speak through the remaining schedule and maybe the execution risk on TR3 and just touching on the F-35 growth trends ahead? \nChris Kubasik: Yeah, yeah let me give a quick F-35. You know we've talk about before we're a top 10 supplier, looking at it just the other day. We deliver about 1500 parts per jet. But the main focus has been TR3, where we have three components; I mentioned two of those three. We were successful in getting a production contract, which I think is indicative of the progress we've made.  You know where we are right now is going through the safety of flight on these three products. One has completed the test. One is just about to start later this week and the third starts in October, so it's all per schedule. We're committed and focused on making sure we're ready for the lot 15 cut in. That's a big focus of both Lockheed and the [inaudible] and I'd say over the last six months the teams have made a lot of good progress. We are communicating, we understand the schedule, we understand the risk. So you know I feel good about our piece of that great program in contributing to Lockheed and allowing them to deliver their jet.  So as usual, in any development program there's directed change, there's government dependencies and stuff that we're used to and accustomed to and manage and work around. So I'd say probably feel better about the program now that I did in April. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed with your question. \nGeorge Shapiro: Good morning. \nChris Kubasik: Good morning, George. \nGeorge Shapiro: Jay if you could go through the working capital days you expect for the end of the year. The goal I thought has been 52 days. This quarter it looks like working capital actually was up like about $135 million on a sequential basis, so just looking at where you are going there. And then just to verify, the $400 million reduction in sales was all due to the divestiture? \nChris Kubasik: That's exactly right. I'll take the second question first, George. The two businesses, the multiple businesses that we divested at the end of the quarter were about $800 million of combined sales, so half here about $400 million impact for the second half and that\u2019s what's driving the reported sales to come down by that amount.  On the working capital it's also good observation. We reset again with the impact of these divestitures George, so at the end of the second quarter, on an adjusted basis we're 57 days and we're trying to get now to around 50-ish days. Part of this was planned, where we had some programs, deliverables in the first half of the year and those receivables will turn into billings and collections in the back half of the year.  We also had in the second quarter just high receivable balance with the timing of sales and so that will just normalize and we'll collect that cash here in the third quarter, and really for us the working capital reduction is the same as it's always been really for the year. It's really driving the inventory.  Two elements as I mentioned; one is just delivering on our key program milestones, so we can turn those into billings and into collations. And then second element is really delivering on our working capital initiatives and these are the things that we\u2019ve been talking about as far as reduced cycle time, improving our forecasting process. So you know a big second half for us, and it\u2019s actually the way we had planned it and we believe that we are on track for that. And I\u2019d say that end of the year George is really kind of 49 to 50 days on this new adjusted basis, taking out these divestitures. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question. \nCarter Copeland: Right in and under the hour. Thanks guys. Good morning. \nChris Kubasik: Good morning, Carter. \nCarter Copeland: Chris, I want to kind of end here with a higher level question on you know just strategy. When you came to L3 five years ago you know and think about where you've gotten now in terms of organic growth, inorganic growth and divestitures, the simultaneous integration, you're now at a point where you said you're done with the divestitures, you\u2019re not in a hurry on M&A. When you look at the next five years and try to maintain that internally disruptive mindset you know what's going to drive the next leg of the value creation formulary? Is it about R&D and development and customers and products more so than the value creation elements we've seen over the last five years? How do you continue to have that kind of mindset and in creating value over the next five? \nChris Kubasik: Alright, Carter. Well, you got a good memory, so thanks for that and clearly it was a great team effort to get to this point.  I've talked somewhat about where we're trying to position L3 Harris and since I listened to all the questions throughout the day, you know I'll try to explain the vision here. We have our traditional primes which some great companies with a lot of cash and employees and processes. There was a couple of questions about these new entrants which are maybe a little more commercial mindset, a little more agile, maybe a little more creative, and what we're trying to do is put L3 Harris right in the middle of those two and take the best of the both and position ourselves to listen to our customers and be a trusted disrupter. I don't want to underestimate the importance of understanding the mission. So we know the mission, we know the customers and can we take that with our industry leading R&D investment and position ourselves for growth.  You know Jab[ph] C2 is something that's out there, that we can talk about more in future calls, but we really want to position ourselves to help our customers solve their problems and focus on the organic growth, focus on the margin improvement, the double digit free cash flow per share metrics; I think they're all going to drive value. So I ultimately want to be the most valuable defense technology company in the mind of our shareholders, in the mind of our customers and that's not necessarily the largest and that's what the team is also executing on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Arment: Yes, good morning Chris and Jay, nice results. Hey Chris, just thinking about your e3, I guess it\u2019s you know becoming kind of ingrained in the culture now. Outside of kind of the operational excellence here you are driving, is there any kind of other buckets that still you see as the greatest opportunity to kind of show incremental savings? \nChris Kubasik: Yes Peter, thanks for that question. We've actually taken e3 to be our operating model in the broadest sense. So a lot of times people think of it just on the continuous improvement initiative, but the approach we've taken on e3 is much, much broader. It encompasses EH&S, it encompasses the supply chain, ESG, continuous improvement, all those aspects, quality, roll throughput yield, everything that that drives our performance, including our performance on our programs where we look at our customer ratings, we look at award fee scores. We looked at our value management.  So when you look at all those things holistically, each and everyone contributes to our cash flow and our profitability. So as we can bring down lead times or cycle times, improve the quality, we look at cost of poor quality, get the yield higher. Each and every one of those is part of our e3 umbrella, and that's really what's driving the success we've had to-date and the optimism we have for the future. \nChris Kubasik: So with that I think I'll just kind of wrap it up. I appreciate everybody taking time to call in today. Hopefully as you heard, we have a strong quarter and the performance and the operational momentum is all positive. Obviously, it wouldn't be possible without my great leadership team and the 47,000 employees, so thanks again to them.  We feel good about the opportunities ahead. We're going to continue to execute and look forward to talking to everybody in the months ahead as we focus on growing L3 Harris. Again, thanks for joining the call.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day!",

            "name": "Chris Kubasik",
            "content": "Well, thank you Rajeev and good morning everyone. I'd like to thank the entire L3Harris team for a job well done as we began our third year as a new company. We are executing the integration plan and have exceeded many of our targets despite challenges such as the pandemic. The high performance culture and leadership team we've created are set to carry this momentum forward, which is reflected in today's results. We reported a strong second quarter, organic revenue was up over 6% with growth across our key end markets and all four business segments. Funded book-to-bill was 1.0 for the quarter and 1.05 year-to-date. Margins increased to 18.6% resulting in EPS of $3.26, up 15%. We had solid free cash flow of $685 million, which contributed to shareholder returns above $1 billion, including repurchases of $850 million in the quarter and over $1.5 billion year-to-date. Our first half performance coupled with our expectations for continued execution in the back half more than offset the divestiture headwinds and supports another raise to our EPS guidance which Jay will cover.  Execution against our strategic priorities that are on slide three continue to deliver results and create value for the company's stakeholders as we make progress and build momentum with top line opportunities, operational performance, announcing and closing divestitures and delivering on our capital return commitments.  In terms of the top line, we are at our best quarter since the start of the pandemic, with progress against our key end market growth objectives while seeing data points that validate our focused R&D strategy. Our government businesses were up 6% in the second quarter, driven by double digit growth internationally.  Our international revenue benefited from increased aircraft ISR and radio sales to regions in the Asia Pacific and Europe. And on the domestic front, the growth was broad based with our responsive space and maritime programs, as well as land modernization for night vision and SATCOM products leading the way.  Our strategy to deliver end-to-end mission solutions utilizing the capabilities and scale across the broader organization continues to gain momentum. Our space business strategy is working as we grew 10% in the quarter, capturing classified awards totaling over $300 million for ground and responsive satellite solutions. These awards are also part of the revenue synergy capture efforts and bring awards to-date to over $700 million on a win rate of 70% from our growing $7 billion plus pipeline.  Turning to our commercial aerospace and public safety businesses, they were up over 5% in aggregate, and were led by our commercial aerospace business, up double digits off a low base, and from strength in product sales. On the public safety side, there was a modest decline, but with sequential improvement and increased bid in proposal activity from a more stable backdrop.  Our solid top line was accompanied by backlog growth, as we continue to win strategic programs that includes several pride roles. Backlog increased 7% organically year-over-year to over $20 billion with notable award activity across all domains.  On the space side our revenue synergy awards came from combining electronics and optics capabilities across the company to deliver solutions for an increasingly contested environment. These are incremental to the pathfinder finder programs we previously won, which have billions of dollars of potential over time. Customers are viewing L3Harris as a trusted disrupter. They see us as a company that understands the complexity of the mission and can offer fresh and creative solutions. With a three year space pipeline of nearly $20 billion, there is more opportunity for continued growth.  Within the air domain, we strengthened our existing F-35 franchise with initial production awards for the Aircraft Memory System and the Panoramic Cockpit Display Electronic Unit under the TR3 program. This brings total orders year-to-date on the platform to about $500 million. We're progressing on all three TR3 systems through integration and qualification this year and in support of the planned of Lot 15 cut-in of the production hardware. We have also secured a roughly $100 million IDIQ with SOCOM for infrared EO Sensors on Rotary platforms, furthering our modernization opportunities across L3Harris.  Moving over to the land side, we signed several key contracts that touched both international and domestic markets. First, we received a $3.3 billion five year IDIQ for foreign military sales, to a range of partner countries from our new broader portfolio of products, including radios and SATCOM terminals. This replaces our prior 5 year $1.7 billion contract, which supports and validates the continued modernization across geographies and expands our product scope.  Second, in the UK we received a logistics support contract covering Legacy Bowman and future MORPHEUS radios, positioning us well for $1 billion modernization opportunity in that country. And third, we won a competitive 10 year IDIQ to supply the U.S. Air Force with our T7 Multi Mission Robots, further expanding our customer reach. After launching the T7 with the UK a few years back, we are now pursuing other international opportunities in the robotic area.  Within the sea domain, our team was successful in extending its leading prime position in undersea sensor systems and warfare training for a range of the U.S. Navy platforms and support of distributed maritime operations. This Undersea Warfare training range program called USWTR has an award value of nearly $400 million and further builds our credibility to pursue additional domestic and international opportunities.  In the cyber domain, while limiting to what we can say due to the classified nature, our $1 billion Intel and Cyber business received over 250 million in orders for complex mission solutions and specialized communications for both domestic and international markets, leading to another quarter of book-to-bill above 1.0 for this business. We also had a key award in an adjacent market with our public safety business, with a 15 year $450 million contract from the state of Florida to upgrade and continue operating its law enforcement system for first responders.  Moving over to the budgets, while the process is ongoing, and we await to file up [ph] we were pleased with the initial request for the FY 22 budget as a support stability in the DoD, NASA and FAA spending and is aligned with our capabilities and investment priorities. For the DoD, it's focused on continuing to revolve around and address near peer threats, through high value technology which Congress is revealing, and when we look at the portfolio and the relevant line items, our programs are well supported.  This builds on the trend we've seen in international markets, where there's a broad stability in military spending, including key countries such as the UK, Australia, Canada, Japan amongst others. We are also seeing growing demand for the type of defensive systems we offer for our alignment with the U.S. Export policies to ensure partner security.  Our most significant opportunities remain for ISR aircraft missionization and other upgrades, land force modernization and enhanced Maritime Systems. All-in-all, as we consider the trajectory of our top line over the coming years, we remain confident in our ability to outgrow the budget and deliver sustainable growth through our domestic positioning, revenue synergies and international expansion to drive a large pipeline of opportunities underpinned by our leading R&D investments.  Shifting to operational performance, we continue to surpass milestones for priority programs. For example, at SAS the team completed a successful preliminary design review for an advanced EW solution called Viper Shield that can deliver self-protection capability for Block 70 F-16.  At IMS we advanced our unmanned Maritime Strategy with several customer engagements and demonstrations, highlighting differentiators and predictive autonomy on USVs, as well as a submerged torpedo tube launch and recovery for our small UUVs. We also successfully completed a prototype demonstration for a SOCOM Multirole aircraft in a variety of challenging conditions, while utilizing the breadth of L3 Harris offerings.  And financially, we had another quarter of strong margins as the team continues to offset mixed impacts from early stage programs with three e3 initiatives, including program excellence and factory productivity, allowing us to flow through cost synergies totaling an incremental $27 million in the quarter.  In addition, the first half synergy run rate is now $350 million, driven by progress on facilities, consolidation and IT efficiencies. We see this as the minimum level we'll deliver on this year, up from the $320 million to $350 million range we discussed in April and still a year ahead of schedule. Any the upside from here will be incorporated in our e3 programs, with our integration efforts blending into operational excellence initiatives. Our margins for the year, this leaves us at about 18.5% for the top hand of the prior guide and a level we'll look to build on in the years ahead.  Next, on capital allocation, today we announced the sale of two small businesses within our Aviation Systems segment for $185 million in cash, and these should close before year end. When combined with the roughly $2.5 billion divested under our portfolio shaping initiative, total gross proceeds are set to be $2.7 billion. We have now divested nearly 10% of our revenues and with the completion of a few others in process, our portfolio shaping program announced in 2019 is largely complete.  Proceeds from divestitures including those from the recently completed military training and combat propulsion businesses will be part of our capital returns program, consistent with our shareholder friendly capital allocation approach. Our expectation now is for buybacks to be roughly $3.4 billion this year, up versus our prior guide of $2.3 billion. When combined with dividends, capital returns will be about $4.2 billion in 2021.  So to wrap up, I'm pleased with the execution against our strategic priorities, confident in our ability to consistently deliver double digit EPS and double digit free cash flow per share growth, and I'm excited about the next phase for L3Harris.  With that, I'll hand it over to Jay. Good morning, Doug. Yes Doug, this is Chris. Thanks for the question, and yes, you absolutely got it right. We've been quite successful in the Communication Segment of late with some of those wins not only here domestically but internationally as well. So I think what we're seeing is some upward pressure for revenue growth and margins over the longer term, like we've talked about before. We had a great quarter when you looked at the book-to-bill, and the continuation for modernization of the land force is, whether it's the radios, the night vision goggles, SATCOM we're really in a good, position. So maybe I'll throw it over to Jay to give you a little more color. And I'll just chime in there. Yesterday we signed a contract with the Mid-East country for the first phase of a multi-year Next Gen STR standardization program, and this has the potential for up to $1 billion over the next several years, so a lot of good positive momentum. Good morning. Oh absolutely! Now we've had a good run in space and as I mentioned, you know we had a good quarter book-to-bill in space was 1.2 so far this year and we've been successful in winning 10 of 18 prime positions just in the last 18 months. So that's something that we're quite proud of and we've also moved into the missile defense arena.  So, maybe a little longer answer. The approach we're taking in space is similar to what we've done in all five domains, and it's really understanding the customers' mission. We have 47,000 employees and 20,000 engineers and 20,000 employees with clearances.  So we are looking at our capabilities, we're looking at how we are spending our IRAD and we are trying to develop solutions and alternatives that meet their needs. We've talked a lot in the past as you know about our responsive SATs, where we were able to develop and launch satellites within twenty months. So that's helping us win a lot of these prime positions. We understand the mission, we have innovative solutions. The focus is on the payload and the integration and speed. So strategically, I think that has been a needle mover. When I look at the exquisite satellites, you know we continue to have some of the best payloads out there, so we're working with partners, usually the larger prime and that's contributed to some success and we have some awards coming up in the next few months that are classified. And then we're working collaboratively with some of these new entrants, just like we do with the traditional primes and find where we can partner, where we can compete, and it seems to be working. So very proud of that team and the outlook is quite positive in space and the budget is clearly supporting this growth as well. Good morning. Well, thanks David. I mean a small part of the margin improvement does come from volume and you know we've talked about organic growth trajectory, so that's a contributor. But the big driver is ultimately e3, and we talked about the synergies which are a year ahead of schedule and we're committed to a $350 million run rate.  A lot of this takes more than just the two or three years that we've talked about, and each and every function is developed and executing a transformation plan. It takes investments sometimes in systems and processes, but we believe there's continual upside. We've proven it, we're focused on this, something Jay and I review on a regular basis.  So we see no reason why the e3 program can't continue. I'll let Jay jump in on the pension assumptions, but again, the execution has been what's helpful and driving the margins. We're able to control our EACs and the commitments that we sign up to with our customers.  So Jay, a little more color. Good morning. Well, thank you for the question. Now we've had numerous transactions that comprise the $2.7 billion. You know I went back and looked at our original estimates and we've generally answered your question and have been able to meet or in some cases slightly exceed what we had projected. You know we talked way back about maybe about $2.8 billion of gross proceeds from all these divestitures where 2.7 and as I mentioned a couple of small ones. So we'll clearly get within the range of our expectations.  You know on the M&A front, we did come out of the box two years ago and said we really were going to stand down on M&A and focus on the integration and the divestitures, and as I've highlighted that's gone very well or maybe even better than expected. But even during that two year period we watched the market. I'm highly confident we didn't miss anything in the two year period. So we'll continue to survey the market where we're looking at anything that is \u201ca must have\u201d as we call it.  You know when I look at the portfolio, as we said over the two years, we're in all five domains. I don't really see any glaring needs or gaps. So we'll either proactively approach companies or respond to inbound calls, but we're really going to continue to hold the discipline, look at things strategically, look at them operationally, make sure the financial hurdles make sense. So not really in a rush and very pleased with what we've been able to win organically. So, hopefully that that gives you some insight Robert and we'll let you know as things progress. Yes, I'll take the Next Gen Jammer one first of then ask Jay to chime in on SAS. No, you're right. It's going to be mid-August when we hear the results. We're very supportive and confident and in the process that the U.S. Navy ran and we're assuming that we began work in August and that's built within the model and the guidance. So no additional upside from that, but a huge win and we're looking forward to getting started and delivering those capabilities. Okay. Well, there's a lot of questions there. I'll go backwards. Yeah, I mean I try to encourage my team that we got to spend time with our customers and listen to their challenges and such. So, actually this evening I'll be headed to DC and have three days of meetings in the Pentagon with a whole variety of customers from OSD and the single services and obviously bring in the key P&L leaders with me. So we like to listen to our customers and see how we can help them and work collaboratively with them on the budget process and such, so. I think everybody does it, but that's something I'm focused on.  International, you know we came out of the shoot and said, this was one of the areas we thought we could do better and I think we said we were underperforming as a combined company, and we were probably right around 19% of our revenue, maybe 20% on a pro form basis back in 29 \u2013 or 2019. So far this year we're at about 22% of our revenue coming from international. So we're seeing a little positive movement. As you it's a little lumpy.  You know as I mentioned, you know maybe somewhat surprising, the budgets have really been stable across the globe consistent with the U.S. So I think that was a pleasant surprise given the threat environment and you think of U.K., Australia, Japan, Canada and so our approach and strategy that I've talked about is really two-fold. We have the ten focus countries where we have executives, either local country national or ex-pats there day-to-day, understanding the process, the threats and bringing in our P&L leaders, at least when the border is opened to try to close on deals.  So that seems to be working well and then more on the traditional product side, you know we use the distributors and the reps and we've been able to use previous relationships to expand the portfolio. You know I mentioned that IDIQ for FMS you know as an example. That now allows all the products of the new company to come through, not just the traditional radio. So, I think that's a positive.  You know a lot of what we do is focused on more defensive systems we're hearing from our international customers, because ultimately they want situational awareness and the ability to communicate in a contested environment. So you know I look at our portfolio and the things we're doing on ISR aircraft, whether it's something like a rivet joint to a business jet, and in some cases to a single prop aircraft.  We have a broad portfolio that allows them to get situational awareness. We've talked quite about \u2013 a bit about our resilient comps capability, our Waveforms library, which is second to none and you know relative to the regions it's the usual place, the Mid East, the Far East and Asia Pacific and we're seeing growth opportunities in all those areas.  So that's probably a longer answer than you wanted, but we're optimistic and I think we're in a good position and executing on the strategy we laid out two years ago. Good morning. Okay. Let me do high level on the first question and Jay can give you some more color on Tac Com and then I'll come back and answer the IVAS question.  So specifically domestically we've talked about some upcoming awards that should be occurring here domestically, the HMS Manpack, HMS Leader, those are coming forward here, hopefully in the third quarter. You know in the fourth quarter the marines have a handheld competition that we're also looking forward to getting to results.  Then of course internationally we have a pretty good increase here later in the year and again, the focus there is going to be in Europe, the Mid East and Asia, the Asia Pacific region. Again, we've had good success in the Mid East that I just mentioned from yesterday, some Australian orders and really a pretty strong pipeline. But I'll let Jay give you a little more color in numbers as it relates to Tac Com. Going back to IVAS, you know I think when you look at our ENVG-B program and IVAS, I would say that you're kind of going head-to-head and maybe battling a little bit for budget money although both were funded and you know our focus is clearly to deliver, which our team has done a great job on schedule and meet all of our commitments. I think ultimately its going to be a question of how these get split. I think there's several hundred thousand devices needed and they have slightly different capabilities and mission sets. So I would think over time there's going to be a split between the two. You know we've been talking a little more publicly about some of the augmented reality capabilities within the ENVG-B, you know the real focus on the night vision capabilities. So different capabilities, different mission and you know I would think the two converge at some point and we'll see how the army wants to play that out. But right now we're just focused on delivering and making sure we meet our commitments. Good morning. Good morning. Yeah, yeah let me give a quick F-35. You know we've talk about before we're a top 10 supplier, looking at it just the other day. We deliver about 1500 parts per jet. But the main focus has been TR3, where we have three components; I mentioned two of those three. We were successful in getting a production contract, which I think is indicative of the progress we've made.  You know where we are right now is going through the safety of flight on these three products. One has completed the test. One is just about to start later this week and the third starts in October, so it's all per schedule. We're committed and focused on making sure we're ready for the lot 15 cut in. That's a big focus of both Lockheed and the [inaudible] and I'd say over the last six months the teams have made a lot of good progress. We are communicating, we understand the schedule, we understand the risk. So you know I feel good about our piece of that great program in contributing to Lockheed and allowing them to deliver their jet.  So as usual, in any development program there's directed change, there's government dependencies and stuff that we're used to and accustomed to and manage and work around. So I'd say probably feel better about the program now that I did in April. Good morning, George. That's exactly right. I'll take the second question first, George. The two businesses, the multiple businesses that we divested at the end of the quarter were about $800 million of combined sales, so half here about $400 million impact for the second half and that's what's driving the reported sales to come down by that amount.  On the working capital it's also good observation. We reset again with the impact of these divestitures George, so at the end of the second quarter, on an adjusted basis we're 57 days and we're trying to get now to around 50-ish days. Part of this was planned, where we had some programs, deliverables in the first half of the year and those receivables will turn into billings and collections in the back half of the year.  We also had in the second quarter just high receivable balance with the timing of sales and so that will just normalize and we'll collect that cash here in the third quarter, and really for us the working capital reduction is the same as it's always been really for the year. It's really driving the inventory.  Two elements as I mentioned; one is just delivering on our key program milestones, so we can turn those into billings and into collations. And then second element is really delivering on our working capital initiatives and these are the things that we've been talking about as far as reduced cycle time, improving our forecasting process. So you know a big second half for us, and it's actually the way we had planned it and we believe that we are on track for that. And I'd say that end of the year George is really kind of 49 to 50 days on this new adjusted basis, taking out these divestitures. Good morning, Carter. Alright, Carter. Well, you got a good memory, so thanks for that and clearly it was a great team effort to get to this point.  I've talked somewhat about where we're trying to position L3 Harris and since I listened to all the questions throughout the day, you know I'll try to explain the vision here. We have our traditional primes which some great companies with a lot of cash and employees and processes. There was a couple of questions about these new entrants which are maybe a little more commercial mindset, a little more agile, maybe a little more creative, and what we're trying to do is put L3 Harris right in the middle of those two and take the best of the both and position ourselves to listen to our customers and be a trusted disrupter. I don't want to underestimate the importance of understanding the mission. So we know the mission, we know the customers and can we take that with our industry leading R&D investment and position ourselves for growth.  You know Jab[ph] C2 is something that's out there, that we can talk about more in future calls, but we really want to position ourselves to help our customers solve their problems and focus on the organic growth, focus on the margin improvement, the double digit free cash flow per share metrics; I think they're all going to drive value. So I ultimately want to be the most valuable defense technology company in the mind of our shareholders, in the mind of our customers and that's not necessarily the largest and that's what the team is also executing on. Yes Peter, thanks for that question. We've actually taken e3 to be our operating model in the broadest sense. So a lot of times people think of it just on the continuous improvement initiative, but the approach we've taken on e3 is much, much broader. It encompasses EH&S, it encompasses the supply chain, ESG, continuous improvement, all those aspects, quality, roll throughput yield, everything that that drives our performance, including our performance on our programs where we look at our customer ratings, we look at award fee scores. We looked at our value management.  So when you look at all those things holistically, each and everyone contributes to our cash flow and our profitability. So as we can bring down lead times or cycle times, improve the quality, we look at cost of poor quality, get the yield higher. Each and every one of those is part of our e3 umbrella, and that's really what's driving the success we've had to-date and the optimism we have for the future. So with that I think I'll just kind of wrap it up. I appreciate everybody taking time to call in today. Hopefully as you heard, we have a strong quarter and the performance and the operational momentum is all positive. Obviously, it wouldn't be possible without my great leadership team and the 47,000 employees, so thanks again to them.  We feel good about the opportunities ahead. We're going to continue to execute and look forward to talking to everybody in the months ahead as we focus on growing L3 Harris. Again, thanks for joining the call."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "A - Chris Kubasik",
            "content": "Good morning. Fine! How are you doing? Yes Sheila, what's happening with IMS in the back half of the year is we had strong growth in the ISR business, which was mostly these international customers. That will moderate and abate a little bit here in the second half of the year, and so the growth rate is just going to normalize back to what we are expecting really for the full year, that's really the key driver, really strong international in the first half that moderates really in the second half for the business back to a normal rate. Right Rob, great questions. We did see some good recovery, double digit in the second quarter driven a little more by the products and the actual training. I think there's a slight lag there. You know we have a variety of training models from academies you know where the cadets actually come into our facilities for an 18, 12 to 18 month period. That's been a little challenged due to some of the border closures, so that's a little lagging. I think as the borders open up we'll see an uptick there, of course the delta viruses is coming through on a curved ball in everything compared to what we thought it would be, so the recovery is lagging a little bit. You know the simulators, as you said there's a pilot shortage. People either need to get the training refreshed or a lot of pilots may have retired and there's now going to be some new pilots that are going to need the simulator training. And then of course for the actual manufacturing you know we had a slow start to the year as you would expect, not a lot of people buying simulators, but so far in the third quarter, even though it's early August, we've already been awarded two simulators and we'll be converting those to contracts here in the next 30 to 45 days.  So we are seeing an uptick and you know it's going to drive growth in the second half. We're assuming \u2013 I'll let Jay give the exact numbers, double digit growth in commercial aviation. So it is a good market, it's got good technology and we're going to continue to run that business and evaluate and determine strategically what we want to do with it. But it's part of the company now and its contributing and we're excited about the uptick, so Jay? Yeah Michael, thanks for that. It's a great, great question. I mean as I said, 6%, 6.2% organic growth. You know when I look at \u2013 as we go through the planning process and build up our annual operating plan, you know we start the year and we usually have pretty good visibility into what's already in backlog, you know so a lot of \u2013 it's kind of in the 70% range as we look forward, so you know going back to December of 2020 when we put out our guidance for '21 pretty good visibility, 70%. You know there's maybe 10-ish or so of follow-on.  So you know to answer your question, I guess you could say maybe 15%, maybe 20% at the most is revenue derived from new business to give you some idea. You know on the \u2013 it is driven by new programs or new contracts is kind of how I look at it. And as you suggest, some of those, especially with the DoD start out as cost plus contracts, you know then its migrated into a low rate production, a full rate production. So you know it's no secret that the cost plus margins tend to be lower than what we're currently realizing, so it's dilutive on that front and then even on the fixed price contracts. I think we're generally pretty conservative in how we start poking those until we retire and mitigate the risk. So maybe that answers your question there. As far as competitive pricing pressures, you know nothing new or different than what we've had over the last decade or two in this industry. You know the selection criteria varies by program and I think our customers are very sophisticated and they look at the technical solutions, they look at past performance, they look at the management team, they look at cost, they look at schedule. So you know they are taking all those things into consideration.  Like I said earlier, to an earlier question, we try to find ways to work collaboratively with these new entrants, when and if they can add value and increase our probability of when. So, I don't know, Jay anything further? [Cross Talk]"

So you know that's what happens in IMS, mainly in the ISR sector."

            "content": "Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. First, I'll provide more color on the quarter. I'll cover also the segment results and finish with our updated outlook.  Starting with the second quarter, organic revenue was up 6.2% with a return to growth in all four segments. IMS led the way up 12%, followed by a return to growth at AS of 4.7%. Margins expanded 40 basis points to 18.6%, primarily from e3 productivity, program performance and integration benefits, partially offset by higher R&D. The sequential decline in margin was also due to timing of R&D as expected.  These drivers, along with our share repurchases led to EPS being up 15% up $0.43 to $3.26 as shown on slide five. Of this growth, volume, synergies and operations contributed $0.18; a lower share count contributed another $0.18 and pension tax and interest accounted for the remaining $0.07.  Free cash flow was $685 million, while working capital days stood at 57 due to receivables timing. And shareholder returns of over $1 billion were comprised of $850 million in share repurchases, and $207 million in dividends. Of note, our last 12 months of share repurchases have totaled over $3 billion at an average price of $195 per share, well below our current share price.  Now, turning to the quarterly segment results on slide six. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was up 12%, led by double digit growth in ISR aircraft missionization on a recently awarded NATO program. In addition to mid-single digit growth in maritime from a ramp on key platforms, including the Virginia Class submarine and Constellation Class frigate.  This more than offset the low single digit decline in our Electro Optical business that was due to the timing of WESCAM turret deliveries, which we expect to increase in the back half. Operating income was up 2%, while margins contracted 150 basis points to 15.3%, reflecting expected mixed impacts, including a ramp on growth platforms and programs. Funded book-to-bill was 0.81 in the quarter and 1.06 for the first half with strength across the segment.  In Space & Airborne, organic revenue increased 3.2% from our missile defense and other responsive programs, driving 10% growth in space, along with mid-single digit classified growth in Intel and cyber.  This strength outweighed the impact from modernization program transitions in our airborne businesses. We have 35 Tech Refresh 3 program within eight Mission Avionics and F-16 Viper Shield Advanced Electronic Warfare System.  Operating income was up 7.7% and margins expanded 90 basis points to 19.7% as operational excellence, including program performance, increased pension income and integration benefits more than offset higher R&D investments, and funded book-to-bill was over one for both the quarter and first half, driven by space.  Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was up 3.2% with mid-single digit growth in Tactical Communications, that included international up double digits, driven primarily by modernization demand from Asia Pacific and Europe, and an anticipated decline in DoD from last year's second quarter, 40% plus growth.  U.S. DoD modernization continued to benefit the integrated vision in global communication businesses leading to high single digit and double digit growth respectively. Conversely, broadband was down low single digits on lower volume for legacy unmanned platforms due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments as expected. And public safety was down 7% from residual pandemic related impacts.  Operating income was up 8.3% and margins expanded 170 basis points to 25.5% from higher volume, operational excellence, and integration benefits, and funded book-to-bill in the quarter and first half grew by 1.3 and 1.1 respectively.  Finally, in Aviation Systems, organic revenue increased 4.7%, driven primarily by our commercial aerospace business that was up 20% from recovering training and air transport OEM product sales. We also saw a mid-single digit growth in defense aviation from a ramp on fusing inordinance programs and in mission networks from higher FAA volume.  Operating income was up 17% and margins expanded 200 basis points to 14.5% from operational excellence, integration benefits and higher volume. Funded book-to-bill was about 0.9 for the quarter and first half.  Okay, shifting over to our 2021 outlook. Overall, organic revenue growth is unchanged at 3% to 5% with our top line trending as expected at 4% for the first half and supported by a 1.05 funded book-to-bill year-to-date. Our U.S. Government businesses are expected to accelerate in the back half driven by Space, Tactical Communications, Integrated Vision Solutions and Classified Growth within Intel and Cyber and Defense Aviation.  On the international side we continue to expect mid-single digit plus growth for the year, as a strong first half, led by aircraft ISR and international Tactical Radios moderates. And lastly, the encouraging results in our commercial businesses in the second quarter build confidence in a flattish outlook for the year with double digit growth in the back half.  Consistent with our overall guide at the consolidated level, we also maintained our segment sales guide as well. And as we think about the second half of the year, our key watch items will be the timing of awards, the continued performance of our supply chain, and the pace of the commercial recovery.  Turning to margins, we have raised our outlook to approximately 18.5%, a 25 basis point increase to the top end of the previous range due to our strong performance to-date and confidence in our ability to execute on cost synergies, e3 and program deliverables. We do continue to expect margins to have moved lower in the back half due to higher R&D investment and stronger growth on new, earlier stage programs.  From a segment perspective, we are holding to our prior margin guidance ranges across the board, but we're expecting IMS and SAS to be at the upper end of their ranges given their strong performance to-date and are holding AS and CS steady at their midpoints given divestiture dilution at AS and expected mix pressure at CS.  On EPS, we're raising our full year guide to a range of $12.80 to $13, with the midpoint now toward the upper end of our previous range and reflecting 11% growth from 2020, delivering on our double digit commitment in spite of dilution from divestitures.  As shown on slide 11, the increase of $0.05 from the prior midpoint is driven by $0.13 improvement in operations and synergies and 0.19% from a lower share count at 203 million shares, along with a lower tax rate of about 16%, all of which more than offset divested earnings of $0.31. On a standalone basis we expect about $0.15 of net dilution from divestitures.  Moving to free cash flow, our guide of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion is intact, despite divestiture related headwinds of roughly $80 million and continues to reflect the three day working capital improvement from year-end to around 49 to 50 days, that's now adjusted for divestitures. CapEx is expected to be about $365 million, $10 million lower versus the prior guide due to completed divestitures.  Our guidance also now reflects approximately $3.4 billion in share repurchases, an increase of $1.1 billion from our prior guide to account for net proceeds from recently closed divestitures. All told, we expect to return about $4.2 billion to shareholders this year. So let me sum it all up. We delivered strong performance in the quarter and first half, solid revenue and book-to-bill growth. Further expansion of industry leading margins and consistent cash generation and deployment, all enabling another guide raise as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities and drive double digit annual growth in earnings and free cash flow per share.  With that Rob, let's open up the line for questions. Sure. Just a \u2013 maybe just another quick comment on revenue growth over the medium term, Doug. If you recall and if you look at the future, it's somewhat similar to what we have this year. If you look at our segments, we had SAS at four to six, IMS at four to six and now it's followed by CS and AS. If you look to the future, we would expect those two segments to continue to be leaders in growth. I will say as Chris mentioned, if this gives us more confidence in the CS outlook, we probably expect those two to drive a little higher growth than CS in the medium term.  On the margin profile, see, this year we are taking \u2013 from the first half we are going back a little bit and that's really a reflection of the mix on the new programs. We have the army, the HMS Monetization programs, we also have in our broadband communication, the Next Gen Jammer Program, so that's some pretty sizable programs that are actually margin dilutive. The good thing about that is the CMS track record being able to take cost out, drive the margins better over time.  So if you look at the first half that shows you what the potential of the segment could be, and so when we end the year this year we'll be in that say 24% -- right now we're saying 24.5% at the midpoint. We delivered over 25% in the first half of the year, that gives you kind of a view of what the medium term could look like over time. Yes, sure. Just to confirm right on the margins, the absorption is a little benefit. That's typically factored in when we talk about the mix headwinds and that's usually coming in these new programs with thinner margins.  As Chris mentioned, e3 is the key driver. It's going to drive us and talked about 20 to 25 basis points per year over the medium term of being able to continue to drive expansion and we feel pretty confident in that.  The pension, if you think about this year, all-in between FAS and CAS is benefited of about $470 million on an absolute basis. We expect that next year the CAS element to decline a little bit as a result to the ARPU legislation, it was an enacted earlier in the year. As that pushed out funding requirements for pension our recovery for CAS will come down a little bit, but that should be offset by some FAS income. So net-net I would expect the year-over-year pension to be pretty much flat. And on the SAS margins Myles, you know this make about \u2013 the first half, about 19.5% in that ballpark. The back half of the year does step down to 18%, maybe 18% plus in the guidance range at the high end of 18.75%.  The key driver is really mixed on the new programs, particularly in Space. We've got to step up on these missile defense programs. There's a number of other classified programs that we've already won and that you know we anticipate winning here in the back half of the year, which will continue to put some pressure on the margins in the back half. But again, those are things that we had contemplated coming into the year when we set the guide originally and we're pretty impressed by the fact we're able to go to the high end of the guide now based on these same new programs. And just to quickly add to that Richard, you know our growth framework we had laid out a target of mid-single digit plus growth over the medium term for international, so we are comfortable with that. Obviously we're going to be doing that this year if not a little bit better. And as kind of what Chris said, some of these capabilities, the ISR aircraft missionization, if you recall back in our March investor briefing, we've talked about taking the exquisite Rivet Joint capability. Bringing that to business chat is also bringing it to pod capability based on customer affordability, and there's a significant amount of demand around the world for that.  You look at Tactical Communications, we see a lot of these foreign countries following the same DoD modernization path and so we see opportunities there. And I'd say the other areas is maritime, both in manned and unmanned, you know request for support in the capabilities we would provide, both in say electrical distribution and power control, as well as things like autonomy. So we just continue to see a growing pipeline and we're pretty comfortable with that growth objective over the medium term. Yeah Gautam, you know I think overall probably in both cases, both DoD and international you're looking at probably low to mid-single digit growth over the medium term. Part of the reason particularly in DoD is that while we have strong growth on the modernization programs, it does cannibalize a piece of our base business and so you have a little bit of a reduction there with growth, solid growth on the monetization programs, Army being the largest program, that's really in the early innings and we've got the start of full rate production here coming in the back half of this year. Internationally Chris mentioned that before, there's just demand around the world for some significant upgrades as far as modernization, but again I would put the growth rate right now in that low to mid-single digit as new countries come on, other countries fall off and so you know obviously we're going to drive that to more of a mid-single digit, but for now I think it's the best way to think about and look at it. Yeah, you know we step up in the back half of the year to about 30% growth and in the commercial business from 20% here in the second quarter. This is consistent with what we had expected you know coming into the year. The trends that we've seen or have seen thus far really in the month of July support that and so we've got some pretty good demand and a lot of activity going on in terms of our simulator sales and we're also seeing just increased leads as far as new cadet training in our academies and we're also seeing it in the simulator training.  You know as Chris mentioned, the one thing to keep an eye on it for us, just that's more maybe company specific is that we do operate our simulator training in these regions that had been a little bit mixed as far as lockdowns opens up and back \u2013 locked back down and so \u2013 but that's the smallest piece of our business. Overall we're pretty confident with this 30% growth based on what we're saying. Yeah, I mean it varies year-to-year. I'd say on the mix headwind, maybe at a gross level, you're talking anywhere around 25 basis points or so of headwind from year-to-year. And our challenge is really to offset that with about 50 basis points of productivity and so that we have a net 20 to 25 basis points improvement year-to-year. But again just, it will vary. I'd say that it'll probably be just like an average to think about."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2021 earnings call. On the call with me today are Bill Brown, our CEO; Chris Kubasik, our COO; and Jay Malave, our CFO. First, a few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our press release, presentation and SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. With that, Bill, I'll turn it over to you.\nBill Brown: Well, thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today we reported strong first quarter results, building on last year's progress with solid execution across all financial metrics. Organic revenue was up approximately 2% with mid-single-digit growth in our core government businesses, partially offset by COVID-related impacts of about 3 points from our commercial businesses, consistent with our expectations. This should be the last quarter of tough compares due to the pandemic which our team has managed incredibly well and we anticipate more stability in the affected businesses ahead. Margins expanded a robust 140 basis points to 18.9% resulting in earnings per share of $3.18, up 14% and ahead of internal targets. Free cash flow of $630 million supported shareholder returns in excess of $900 million, including repurchases of $700 million from our recently authorized $6 billion program with the balance from dividends following our 20% increase in March. Before handing it over to Chris, with the transition occurring as planned on June 29, this quarter marks my 38th and final earnings call leading Harris and in L3Harris as CEO. It has been rewarding nearly 10 years with the hard work and dedication of our employees, Harris grew from a small niche defense company to a leading mission solutions defense prime post the acquisition of Exelis and the merger with L3 with revenue today of over $18 billion. I am especially proud of the people at L3Harris who work hard every single day to support our customers' critical missions and deliver value to shareholders. The performance culture and the work environment we've created is really special, and we recently were recognized for it by Fortune as a 100 best company to work for in 2021, and earlier this year as the world's most admired company. As you know, I'll continue as Exec Chair of the Board for another year working closely with Chris as he becomes CEO. Last week, the independent Directors of the Board unanimously endorsed the transition occurring as planned in the merger agreement indicating their confidence and mind in Chris's ability to lead this company going forward. The results today speak to the momentum we have in the company and the strong foundation we've built for the future, and I am excited and optimistic about what L3Harris can accomplish in its next phase under Chris's leadership. So with that, Chris let me turn it over to you.\nChris Kubasik: Okay, well thank you Bill, and I appreciate your and the Board's vote of confidence and look forward to our continued partnership in your new role. As you've heard at our investor briefing last month, we're excited about the potential for the company and the value creation opportunities in front of us. The strategic priorities we develop together as shown on Slide 3, are the foundations, on which will deliver sustainable topline growth, steady margin expansion and robust free cash flow with industry-leading capital returns, all areas where we showed great progress in the first quarter. In terms of the top line, our Q1 results coupled with the Biden administration's announcement that the defense budget will continue to grow in FY '22 about 1.5 points versus FY '21 reinforces our optimism for growth. We are encouraged by the continued focus on national security and support for our military within the budget and believe L3Harris is well aligned with priorities that emphasize the return to peer competition and operations in increasingly contested environments. This backdrop provides us opportunities to offer our advanced and affordable solutions across all domains. We are watching closely for more details in the coming months and expect to consistently grow through our strong DoD portfolio, revenue synergies, and international expansion which stem from our R&D investments. In the first quarter, we gained traction as we grew 4.8% in our core government businesses with international up double-digits driven by solid growth in aircraft ISR and tactical radios. Turning to revenue synergies, we received 8 new awards maintaining our healthy win rate of about 70% with total awards to date of approximately $400 million. We anticipate sustaining our momentum given notable prime level awards across all domains that represent multibillion-dollar opportunities. On the Space side, in addition to our recently highlighted HBTSS Responsive Satellite Award with the Missile Defense Agency, our five decades of experience building space-based imaging systems has led to our down select for the initial concept and design of next generation weather imagers. This award supports NOAAs future satellite system recapitalization. The administration's focus on climate initiatives supported by nearly 30% FY '22 budget increase for NOAA, reinforces the opportunity set for L3Harris as we are a leader in weather payload and ground systems, creating an opportunity of $3 billion over the next decade. On the air side, we have strong orders on both new platforms, such as the F-35 and legacy platforms, including the F-18 and F-16. In particular, we leveraged our experience with providing F-16 systems and our expertise in software defined open systems architecture to secure a contract to develop the next-generation electronic warfare suite on international aircraft. We can further expand our global footprint with opportunities in more than a dozen countries, in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. This adds to our recent success with the US Navy's next-generation jammer low band award for the EA-18G Growler. We're quickly establishing ourselves as a global leader in electronic warfare and aircraft survivability. We also closed on the ISR aircraft contract with the NATO customer to missionize a series of G550s that was still pending parliamentary approval last quarter, and we continue to work on similar opportunities for other customers, which when combined with the NATO award demonstrates our ability to expand our international footprint and represents over 3 billion of potential value over the next several years. Moving over to the land side, we continue to make progress supporting modernization efforts on both the domestic and international fronts, including a follow-on production order under SOCOM's $255 million multichannel Manpack IDIQ contract. We also received orders for our advanced radio and night vision products from Western Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia, further strengthening our international leadership. And finally, in the sea and cyber domains, our maritime team was successful in winning two new prime level programs to provide imaging systems on submarines for international customers. These strategic wins highlight our ability to expand our global maritime solutions to new customers with additional follow-on opportunities to come. And while limited in what we can say, due to its classified nature, our billion dollar Intel & Cyber business received a follow-on order to provide end-to-end mission solutions within its ground-based adjacency franchise as we continue to deliver against our customers' most challenging cyber requirements. These wins provide long-term visibility and support for our funded book-to-bill of 1.10 in the quarter. Our total backlog remains above $21 billion, up 6% year-over-year when adjusted for divestitures. In addition, with considerable recent biding proposal activity we're aggressively going after a three-year $125 billion pipeline to deliver sustainable topline growth. Shifting over to margins, this quarter we saw the healthiest results since the merger at nearly 19%, which puts us in a strong position to meet the upper end of our full year guidance. Cost synergies of $33 million, primarily attributable to supply-chain and facilities consolidation, put us well on track to deliver up to $350 million of cumulative net benefits in 2021, a year ahead of schedule. Our e3 program also gained traction through a strong program performance, factory productivity and supply chain savings. And we continue to believe that there is considerable potential beyond this year to enable another phase of cost opportunities to sustain margin expansion for L3Harris. Lastly, we\u2019re maximizing cash flow through continued working capital and CapEx discipline, driving shareholder friendly capital deployment. And while we\u2019re holding off on updating our $2.3 billion share repurchase target for the year, based on our announced and potential divestitures, we still see considerable up-side to the plan. As an update on portfolio shaping, we\u2019ve recently cleared the U.S. antitrust waiting period on both the previously announced Military Training and Combat Propulsion Systems divestiture and are on track to closing the second half of the year. We\u2019re progressing on other portfolio shaping opportunities and we\u2019ll provide more details over the coming months. And to reiterate, inclusive of divestitures, we remain on track to deliver on our $3 billion free cash flow commitment in 2022 along with double-digit cash growth on a per share basis excluding potential tax policy impacts. So, we\u2019re pleased with the execution against our strategic priorities and progress we\u2019ve made at the start of the year, which gives us confidence to raise the bottom end of our EPS guidance. So, with that, I will hand it over to Jay.\nJay Malave: Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. First, let me begin with a brief recap of the quarter before I get into segment results. Organic revenue was up about 2% as growth in IMS, SAS and CS was partially offset by the expected decline in AS due to the pandemic. Overall, our core government businesses were up 4.8% reduced by about 3 points of COVID related impacts in our commercial businesses. Margins expanded 140 basis points to 18.9% with expansion in all four segments, primarily from operational excellence, integration benefits and cost management. We did better than expected in the quarter from stronger e3 and cost synergies of roughly 70 basis points as well as some timing benefits from lower R&D and program mix of approximately 50 basis points. This, along with share repurchase activity led to earnings per share growth of 14% or $0.38 to $3.18 as shown on Slide 6. Of this growth, synergies and operations contributed $0.34, along with a lower share count, pension and interest totaling $0.23 which offset divested earnings and headwinds, prevent the pandemic impact to end markets. Free cash flow of $630 million was the result of solid net income drop through as well as CapEx and working capital discipline with days roughly steady at 55. And shareholder returns of $909 million were comprised of $700 million in share repurchases and $209 million of dividends. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 7 and discuss quarterly segment results. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was up 5.9% with growth in all three businesses. Double-digit growth in maritime from our ramp unmanned platforms, including the Columbia Class submarine and Constellation Class frigate, was complemented by growth in ISR from the NATO award carryover from last year and in electro-optical from deliveries of our WESCAM airborne turrets to the U.S. Army. Operating income was up 19% and margins expanded 180 basis points to 16.5% from cost management, integration benefits and operational excellence. Funded book-to-bill was impressive at over a 1.3 in the quarter. In Space & Airborne Systems organic revenue increased 4.1% from responsive programs including SDA tracking and HBTSS, driving high single digit growth in Space, as well as growth from the F-35 platform in Mission Avionics and double-digit classified growth in Intel & Cyber. This strength is partially offset by program timing in electronic warfare. Operating income was up 8.6% and margins expanded 90 basis points to 19.4% from cost management, including R&D timing, operational excellence, and higher pension income. Funded book-to-bill was a solid 1.15 for the quarter from strong bookings in our Space and Electronic warfare businesses. Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was up 2.9% with high single digit growth in tactical communications, primarily from the continued ramp in U.S. DoD modernization. It also drove integrated Vision Solutions and Global Communication Solutions up double digits. Conversely, volume was lower on legacy unmanned platforms within broadband due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments and within public safety due to anticipated COVID related impacts that are now showing signs of stabilization. Operating income was up 12% and margins expanded 240 basis points to 25.3% from operational excellence, cost and management and integration benefits. Funded book-to-bill was 0.92 for the quarter. Finally, in Aviation Systems organic revenue decreased 8.3%, primarily driven by COVID related impacts in our commercial aviation business, consistent with expectations and from program timing in military training. High single digit growth in Mission Networks from higher FA volume [ph] paired with fusing and ordinance [ph] growth in defense aviation hope to offset these effects. As we move past the first quarter, we\u2019re anticipating a return to growth in this segment as we lap COVID effects while our combined government businesses continue to grow. Operating income was down 13%, primarily from the sale of our airport security and automation businesses. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 15.7% as operational excellence, cost management, including R&D timing, and integration benefits more than offset COVID related headwinds. Funded book-to-bill was 0.84 for the quarter. Okay, let\u2019s shift over to 2021 guidance. We\u2019re off to a strong start with our first quarter results and performance and we\u2019re confident in our integration and operating expectations, as well as our topline growth of 3% to 5%, supported by a solid 1.10 book-to-bill this quarter. This puts us in a position to raise the bottom end of our full-year EPS guidance by $0.10 inclusive of announced divestiture impacts. We will provide a more comprehensive update later in the year. In the interim, I\u2019ll provide some color now on the moving pieces, specifically on margins, portfolio shaping, and capital returns. On margins, the strong start will likely push us toward the upper end of our range of 18% to 18.5%. We do expect margins to normalize for the balance of the year due to increases in R&D and stronger growth in new programs with lower initial margins. Overall, the expected upside for the year from our prior midpoint is due to strong program execution and cost performance. It will be a key factor in our 2021 earnings strength. Our portfolio shaping, we now expect about $0.10 of dilution from announced divestitures, net of buybacks from proceeds. And there are a few remaining businesses that are in various stages of the divesture process which could have a modest incremental EPS impact for the year. Lastly, as highlighted at our Investor briefing, we have another significant year planned for capital returns. Embedded in our guidance is $2.3 billion of share repurchases from cash generation, which will be further augmented by over $1 billion dollars in net divestiture proceeds. So, overall, for 2021 we\u2019re confident in delivering on our commitment of double-digit annual growth in earnings and free cash flow per share. With that Rob, let\u2019s open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you and our first question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning. Congratulations Bill on building the company you have and Chris of course we look forward to what you have in store for us. I guess, I wanted to focus on two businesses that are doing pretty well are accelerating, so on the international front I think it was up double-digits in the quarter, how are you thinking about the main drivers there going forward? And then maybe more on the domestic side of things, if you could focus in on the Space portion of SAS, you called out growth in programs in Space, but wanted to quantify overall Space and just how do you think about growth drivers there going forward just given wins with STA or HBTSS? Lots in there, sorry.\nChris Kubasik: Okay Sheila, thank you very much. Let me start with International. You're right we did have a good quarter with double-digit growth. We had book-to-bill of 1.3. As I mentioned, the aircraft ISR, the Tactical Radios and Maritime were the key drivers. Looking at our pipeline, we have about $35 billion of opportunities over the next three years, so really impressed with the team's work as we position ourselves for future growth. You know it all started with the strategy that we laid out, it's really a two-part strategy, one focusing on the mission systems and the larger programs such as the ISR platforms we have talked about working in tandem with our sales force, which is out there with the products. So, when you look at the Radios, the Night Vision Goggles, the WESCAM, EO/IR turrets, it's a nice complement. So, I think the diversity of our portfolio and the geography with customers in over a 100 countries really positions us well for continued growth. Shifting to the Space question, the Space business is part of SAS. You know I kind of look at it in four buckets. On the low end we have some products, some telemetry and antennas. We do some groundwork, which I think is important to better understand the mission and to support some of these classified constellations. They tend to be mid-single-digit growth, but it's all about the SATs. Historically, we've been on the exquisite satellites as a supplier or a subcontractor. GPS III and classifieds SATs come to mind, but the responsive satellites is really where we've moved the needle last year or so and we're optimistic in the future. So, that's the fastest growing part of the portfolio, double-digits growth for the year. We've talked about the ZEUS program. We talked about SDA Tracking, HBTSS and a fair amount of classified bids that we are working on today. So, hope that gives you a little bit of granularity and insight as to how we are growing Space.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. And best of luck for the future, but it's been quite a ride.\nChris Kubasik: Thank you, Rob.\nRobert Stallard: But my question is quite simple this morning. The Communications margin was very strong in the quarter. I don't think it's a record margin, but certainly feels like it. I was wondering if there was anything unusual that pushed it this high in the first quarter and basically what's going to bring it down into the guidance range for the rest of the year?\nChris Kubasik: Sure Rob. There's nothing unusual that was in the results, but a little bit of R&D timing and so we'll see a little bit of pressure there. But the more significant kind of factor that will normalize the margins towards the balance of the year, will really be related to the newer programs. As you know we've got Army HMS programs in the back half of the year. We also have programs like the Next Gen Jammer in the Broadband business and so those will likely put some pressure on the back half of the year on the margins. I'll just, you know, the broader comment I would say is, it's a great start, maybe this is an indication of how to look, think about things perhaps in the future, but we will see a little bit of a normalization here in the subsequent three quarters.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.\nRichard Safran: Bill, Chris, Jay and Rajeev, good morning. Bill, for what it's worth, I thought you did an absolutely terrific job. So, I wanted to ask about the large pipeline you've been talking about. You've had a very high win rate. I read about new starts like the one with Warren Mattel [ph] and then systems like NOMARS and was wondering how this really large expansion and transformation is going to reshape the company? And thinking longer term, I mean, do you need to increase overhead and your footprint to support new customers? Does CapEx increase to support manufacturing of new platforms? Does the focus of your R&D spend need to shift a bit? And I'm looking at this from a return on invested capital standpoint, trying to find out if the company is sized to support all these new efforts or maybe this is a situation where you're actually doing more with less, expanding operations only with current assets?\nChris Kubasik: Okay, thank you for that question, a great, great question and it ties into the strategy that we've talked about. You mentioned NOMARS, which is an interesting opportunity, that's the No Manning Required Ship, a recent DARPA win, which I think is pretty interesting relative to what the Navy is trying to accomplish. Because as you know historically, we've taken manned ships and tried to convert them into unmanned, and this is an early stage design program, where we would be, we are one of three winners if you will. And it's really starting with a clean sheet of paper. How would you design a ship knowing it was going to be unmanned from the beginning? So, on that one it'll be interesting to see how that progresses. The follow-on will be 2022, which will probably be a prototype. And in that case we team with -- we have a variety of teammates and we would probably team with shipbuilders, so we are not going to be investing in a shipyard in that case. I think generally we are pleased with the footprints and the size of our facilities. We talked about space and some of the growth and we took some existing facilities and modified them and re-laid out the footprint to optimize the flow with new tooling and such. So, we spend a $1 billion a year between CapEx and IRAD. CapEx is about 2% of our revenue. I think that will drift down over time. IRAD is industry leading and it is almost 4%. So, the $1 billion I think positions us well. I do not see any increase in overhead or significant CapEx to meet our strategy. And again most of what we're working on are the systems versus the actual platforms, so does not take up as much factory space, if you will.\nJay Malave: And Richard, when you think about CapEx for the moment, we -- over this next this year as well as the next few years, we have investments in our IT systems as we're consolidating our platforms. We also have investments as we're moving facilities and consolidating facilities. So, as those trail off that will create capacity to invest in new programs over the next few years. So we don't really see significant new requirements from where we are at the levels today in CapEx.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius. Please proceed with your question.\nCarter Copeland: Hey, good morning guys. And Bill, echo all the congratulations on the last several years, it's been an amazing ride.\nBill Brown: Hey thanks.\nCarter Copeland: Just a quick one and then one you might expand on a little bit Chris. Do you guys have any ISR exposure to speak of in Afghanistan that makes for a headwind with the planned withdrawal, just want to cover that base? And then Chris, I wondered if you might expand a little bit on how you think about the capture rates that are embedded kind of in that 3-year pipeline to accomplish your growth goals? I mean, I look at some of the programs you've won and things like HBTSS and Next Gen Jammer Low Band, which may not have been as traditional thought of as things you might go out and win. And it seems like those capture rates have been increasing, but I don't know if you track that or if you can speak to that? Thanks.\nChris Kubasik: Yes, thanks Carter. No we do not -- the first question we do not have exposure in ISR in Afghanistan. Total exposure there is in the $10 million range of revenue and a fair amount of that is just ground systems, so not significant. Great question on the pipeline and the capture rates, and I think you're right, I think we've surprised people with some of the wins that we've had, but it really aligns with what we're hearing from our customers and they're change in acquisition process. They really are looking for disruptive and innovative and agile and affordable solutions and that's what we've been providing. We do track our win rates at the company level and you don't necessarily, if they're too high, it suggests that we haven't opened the aperture and been as aggressive as we would like. So, we track those on a segment and an overall basis and 125 billion over three years, if we were successful in at least 50% that easily tracks to a mid-single digit growth targets, and then on top of that we have the revenue synergies that we've talked about. So, we're comfortable with what we've done. We have professionalized the business development function I believe, and we're starting to see the results from that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nRonald Epstein: Yes, good morning, guys, thanks. How are you thinking about opportunities in commercial space, I mean the space environment has been, business environment anyway, looks like we're going through a period of change. Are there opportunities for all L3Harris there and how are you thinking about that?\nChris Kubasik: Yes, thanks Ron. I think there's been some opportunities in commercial space where some of our payloads, I think we could provide to the primes. As far as us investing in our own constellations or expanding capital is not currently in our strategic plan. Of course, you know we have exposure or capabilities that support the launch vehicles which launch both military and commercial satellites, so we have some opportunities there as well. But as far as being a prime in the commercial space market at this time does not align with our strategic plan.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much. Good morning and yes, congratulations to Bill and Chris. I just wanted to ask if you could provide some of the disclosure that's typically due around the Tactical Radios in terms of the domestic and international sales and the backlog? And then maybe you mentioned some mix shift there as HMS ramps up. At this point, roughly what portion of the DoD in very rough terms Tactical sales come from Army HMS and kind of how do you expect that to evolve over the next year or two?.\nChris Kubasik: Okay Seth, let me first start with some of the accomplishments we've had in Tactical Radios and then I'll hand over the ball to Jay to give you the specific numbers. I mean, we are off to a very good start in 2021 as you saw in the press release. You know on the DoD side, couple of highlights here. The Army HMS Manpack recently completed the IoT in the last year was in the process of going through the DOT&E, Test and Evaluation recently. And the good news is, we just received an RFP for the full rate production. So I think that's a great sign that the modernization is moving forward. In a month or so, the Army should be issuing its HMS Leader Radio RFP, again for full rate production. So, I think that again is an additional positive sign. The Marines recently released an RFP for their Hand Held Radio and the SOCOM business has been growing. We've been meeting milestones. And in my prepared comments I've mentioned an order there for the Multichannel Manpack. So, just gives you some flavors to how the business is doing on the DoD side. Internationally, we have good visibility in Saudi. Last year we booked $174 million order for the Ministry and National Guard, so we'll have that revenue run out through this year and we're working closely with the land forces on the Software Defined [ph] Radio for about 5000 initially, so that's going through the Saudi process. Europe and UK we had good growth. UK the MORPHEUS program is going to replace the BOWMAN radio. So, we are hoping to hear something later this year. So, again I feel pretty confident in what we've done. And Australia, last year we talked about the Delphic Crypto Standard upgrade and new radios for Australia. There's follow-on opportunities there. And of course New Zealand is also a customer that we are working closely with. So, kind of operationally or business development wise I wanted to give you some insight to what's going on and Jay will provide you the numbers you requested.\nJay Malave: Sure, Seth. So, I will give you the numbers in the format we've historically provided. Orders were $424 million, sales 474, of the sales DoD was 297, International was 177, and our funded backlog was 958. Related to your question on Army modernization about third of the DoD is Army modernization and you know that will continue to grow particularly as we are going to full rate production on the Army HMS modernization in the back half of this year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. And good luck Bill in your transition and go Chris and yours. In terms of the F-35 Chris, what better way to bring back old memories and an F-35 question. The hearing was last week. It was brought up Tier 3 and L3Harris potentially being one of the sources of some delays there, could you comment on the progress you're making and the recovery plan there as always seems subcontractor relationship?\nChris Kubasik: Absolutely Myles. I'll give you some background, maybe it's going to be longer answer than you'd like, but I think it's important to kind of calibrate everything, and then I'll ask Jay to maybe give you some of the financial implications. But you're right, I've personally been involved around F-35 for twenty some years as well as many of our senior execs. So, I think that that's an important point and we all absolutely are committed to this platform, which I think is one of the best aircraft in the world. So, L3Harris and legacy companies, we've been a supplier for over twenty years. We have a really good track record. A few months ago we delivered our 2 millionth part and we're like 99.9% on time delivery. So, a lot of the work historically has been with TR2, the Tech Refresh 2, weapons release displays, but your questions specific to TR3, Tech Refresh 3, which is a very complicated developmental program to meet some of the new challenges that our nation faces. So, you're right, we've realized some of the risks, two main drivers, we've realized risk that we had identified and thought could occur when we bid the program. And secondly, as it was referenced in the testimony, there have been numerous government directed changes. So, those are unfortunate, but not unexpected when you're in a developmental program. We are working on three main products, the AMS, the Advanced Memory System, the PCD, which is the Panoramic Cockpit Display and the ICP, which is the Integrated Core Processor. So, we've been stable for the last six months relative to our cost estimates and our schedule. The AMS and PCD hardware are starting qualification and ICP is just behind that. So, when you look at how important the TR3 is, it's a step change in capability. It's half the cost of the TR2 once it gets into production and it's been designed for easier affordability and sustainment. So, we're just about ready to kick off the production phase. I will say that our past financials and our current guidance reflect our performance. We don't anticipate any changes there. And then strategically, these capabilities that we're developing are going to put us in a position to leverage this technology on other products, platforms and future programs. So, we're excited about that, but maybe Jay can comment more specifically on the revenue and the margin implications.\nJay Malave: Yes, just going forward maybe over the next few years, our ship set content today is a little bit over $2.5 million around 2.6, with the TR3 production with Lot 15, that will go to around $3 million per ship set. So, as and that again starting Lot 15, as the aircraft volumes start to flatten out we will see growth just through higher content. It's important to keep in mind that as this modernization program there probably will be other modernization programs that will be involved in and of course it will also be part of sustainment program. And so, we see this as continuing to drive growth. I think we'll update it as each year progresses. This year as Chris mentioned is a little bit softer from a growth perspective but we expect that to pick up next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks very much and best of luck Bill.\nBill Brown: Thanks Dave.\nDavid Strauss: I want to ask a question on the guidance, just so I have it straight. So, the EPS guide as of now doesn't reflect the pending divestitures, but it looks like from the Slide 12 that you think you can offset the dilution through share repurchase [ph]? I guess that's question number one. And then just with the divestitures all coming out of AS, what does that do to the margin profile on a go forward basis for AS?\nJay Malave: Okay. David, just to be clear on the 12.85 that does anticipate or include the $0.10 of expected dilution from the announced divestitures, so that's in the 12.85.As far as the announced divestitures' impact going forward on AS margins, it's about 100 basis points dilutive. So, the margins on these two businesses composite a little bit higher than the average going forward. That again changes I guess downstream, we'll see with organic improvements, but just baseline impact of the divestiture is about 100 basis points.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Pleased proceed with your question.\nDoug hartnett: Good morning. Thank you. Bill, Jay, Chris, I mean, you've seen a lot of companies and I mean, I cannot begin to count the number of situations where management has said, we have a cost reduction program in place. Lay it out. They often have interesting names to them. You all have done the integration. You have the e3 program, and we're really seeing the improvement in margins. But I have to say most of the times you see these cost reduction programs happen and the savings get competed away, mix changes, other costs arise. So when you look forward, can you talk about the things that you're doing and how you can really have confidence that we can see a continued progression of margin improvement?\nChris Kubasik: Doug, thank you. First of all, it's Chris. You're right, the integration and the cost synergies, I think, has been a great success. As I mentioned, we're a year ahead of schedule. And it really goes back to after we announced and before we closed, we had a dedicated team, the integration management office that really laid out in detail a plan to go ahead and capture these cost synergies. And that's something that Bill, Jay and I have been meeting and continue to meet every Monday to review the progress. And it takes time, especially something like IT, as we've been consolidating our ERP systems, investing in the infrastructure and going with new applications, relative to it. So that should wrap up by the end of this year and then we'll focus entirely on the e3 process. It's really becoming part of the culture, and we identify projects, we review them on a weekly basis. And these are just lots of singles and doubles, couple $100,000 here, $1 million there. And we go sector-by-sector, segment-by-segment. And world class organizations continually take out 2% to 3% of their costs each and every year over and above the increase in salaries and others. So we're having good momentum. We have good visibility. We came out strong this quarter, if you see it for the year. And my expectation is that we absorbed the headwinds, and we continue to go forward. So I don't know if anyone has anything further.\nJay Malave: I'll just say, it's, as you would expect and as you know, it's management attention, both the synergy program, and the e3 Operational Excellence Programs went parallel paths from day one of the merger. We've had separate reviews and go through all of those. And these reviews are monthly. So the management system, we expect to continue that we had started from day one of the merger. And we have monthly reviews with each of our segments as Chris mentioned, we go through the top 10, the top 15 programs and e3 Operational Excellence Program to make sure that they're on track. And so it's simple as management attention, focus, and continuing to drive the operational foundational basics of performing better each and every day.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKristine Liwag: Hey, congratulations, Bill and good morning, everyone. Just following up on Doug's question on margin, can you provide a little bit more color on what you know, the e3 top programs are, what initiatives you're pursuing? And also on cost cutting, how do you know you're not cutting too much that it ends up hampering performance in the future?\nChris Kubasik: Yes, thanks for the question, Kristine. I'll start and then give it over to Jay to give you the specific numbers. One, line that we're not cutting and I think I've said this back in the March meeting. And again, you look at what we're investing on the front end of the business and R&D and industry leading them out. I said before, we did not cut R&D, we could have cut R&D and increase the margins further, but we aren't. We're taking a long term approach. The investments we have in bid and proposal of which were submitting lots of proposals. The R&D and direct sale expenditures have generally increased as we try to focus on the front end of the business. You know, we talked about the revenue synergies, important part of our success is the workforce and we actually started day one of the merger with negative synergies as we increased the costs and the benefits to make sure our workforce was fully engaged and supported. So that's, that the headwinds and the items I look at to give me confidence that again, we're not looking at this short term, quite the contrary, we're looking longer term. And we're taking an enterprise wide approach. So we talked about shared services as an example, there's lots of companies out there that had individual segments or sectors, doing their own processing, whether it's payables or payrolls. Some of this stuff isn't overly exciting, but going to a shared service concept, having single process, single systems, and optimizing for the benefit of the enterprise versus individual divisions, sectors or segments is I think part of the strategy. And a lot of people say it, it's not easy to do, and we're doing it, so whether it's procurement, whether it's quality, e3 shared services, all those things we're looking at, at an enterprise level, taking out the inefficiencies. And there's more work to do in the years ahead and that's what gives us confidence. But Jay, do you want to maybe give more detail?\nJay Malave: Yes, as far as specific initiatives, things that you've heard of in the past, whether it should cost value engineering, supply chain, shop productivity, just a specific example, in our ISR businesses, in terms of people, as you would expect, would be all over an aircraft tear down and build and rebuild. Simple things like changing the tooling, so that you get a benefit in ergonomics, as well as a hours reduction or minutes reduction in the rebuild of a particular aircraft. And so, we've been able to take tooling, in some cases, it's customer funded tooling. On top of it we're able to change our processes, improve them and take costs out at the same time. So it's not a we'll just slash costs, and hopefully it sticks. These are more systemic type reductions that we have an organization built around to drive continuous improvement in sustainable reductions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Arment: Yes, good morning, Bill, Chris, Jay and congratulations Bill, best of luck. Hey Chris, on the Space & Airborne the margin performance continues to be really impressive. And I was thinking just about regarding your cost reimbursable mix has continued to grow quite a bit there. I think it was up 30% year-over-year. How do we think about kind of sustaining these margins with the mix shift that's happening there? Is there still a lot of e3 efforts going on pr or maybe just any color there? Thanks.\nChris Kubasik: Yes, thanks, Peter. Now we apply e3 not only to the fixed price contracts, but the cost plus. When we talk about the portfolio that we've built, and how we're positioned in all these domains, a lot of these programs that start out is cost plus or developmental have a long life, sometimes decades, right. So they move into full rate production and then of course, fair amount have potential for international export. So we look at it as a portfolio and then the natural, healthy growing business, you are going to have the headwind mix from the development programs, which will take every day of the week, but the rest of the portfolio is continuing to mature through its cycle. And as I mentioned, F-35 is a good example. We're getting through the TR3, and then we'll be starting in our production. And that program should have a lot of legs as an example. EW is part of SAS, now we've had good success of light, as I mentioned with the F-16 as a specific example. We have legacy programs on the F-18. We don\u2019t talk a whole lot about the cyber business, but that's growing. And again, there's a commercial model aspect to our cyber business that allows us to have licensing and other opportunities to grow margins. So that's pretty much how I look at it. And again, we continue to have confidence, even with the cost plus piece of the portfolio.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys, this is Dan on Gautam. Thanks for the question. So this question, this is actually already asked for, for CS. But I was hoping because, margins were pretty much stronger across the board, but guidance was held. And so I was hoping maybe you could expand on why, particularly IMS and SAS what kind of tempers that performance throughout the remainder of the year to come back into the guidance range? Thanks.\nChris Kubasik: Sure. So in SAS in particular, we expect in their case R&D to tick up in the back half of the year and so that's one. And then as well as just programs growth on some of these new wins is going to drive margins down just on the lower initial margins I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So for us those are just two factors, pick up in R&D and then a pick up in the lower margin new programs.\nJay Malave: Now, that Dan is still early in the year and in my comments, I suggested this because it's high confidence to be at the higher end of the range, so we'll keep it updated and let you know if changes are warranted later in the year.\nBill Brown: And it's similar with IMS as well, again for them, it's program timing, particularly in the maritime business. They've been a lot of new wins in that sector. Chris mentioned, we had mentioned before, things like the Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicle. Also the other programs that they've won is just going to drive a little bit lower margin in the back half of the year as we ramp up those particular programs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Raviv with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nJonathan Raviv: Hey good morning, everyone and of course, congratulations to all, specially Bill and Chris. A slightly more myopic version of Doug's question and Christine's question, a question from Dan. When you think about this year's margin, you're talking about the upper end of the guidance range for this year. So that's at a base off at which we can continue to expand or should we take this year as rapid improvement, as comprising maybe a couple years of expansion, such that '22 could perhaps be flattish. For example, you've mentioned several times, Jay, that you have some new programs ramping up as the year progresses, is that going to maybe hold down some of the expansion opportunity next year?\nJay Malave: Yes, so a little early to talk about our guidance for margins next year, but I will say that our goal each year is to continue to drive the margins up. You know, we've talked about a smaller ramp in expansion, but our goal always is that the e3 productivity Operational Excellence Program exceeds the headwinds from mix and that's what we will strive for each and every year. It's going to vary from year-to-year. So as we get into more specifics, as we put together our plan for next year, we'll be able to obviously give you more detail there. But the way you should think about it on average each year is continued drive up. It will slow from what we've seen in the last few years, but our expectation is to continue to grow.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nNoah Poponak: Hi, good morning, everybody and Bill, congratulations on your time and success with the company and thanks for working with us. It was really a pleasure to work with you.\nBill Brown: Thank you, Noah.\nNoah Poponak: And Chris, all the best going forward and look forward to working with you as well.\nChris Kubasik: Thank you, as do I.\nNoah Poponak: Could you guys update us on the programs that had slipped last quarter that you identified? There was the ISR aircraft program that you discussed? And then I think there might have been a few other smaller ones? Did those land in 1Q or not and if they didn't, when do they? And with the ISR1, my understanding was the delay was caused actually by being sized up, but that you hadn't put all of that into the guide. If you could just update us on how you're handling that in the outlook.\nChris Kubasik: Yes, Noah, all those items that didn't quite cross the goal line in December were in fact booked in Q1. So the guide represents those programs that have been booked, the results are in the quarter and for the year. So we're very optimistic. I mean, the ISR business, when you take this NATO customer, plus what we've done in Australia, and here in the U.S. with the C3D [ph] program, there's still lots of legs in aircraft ISR. So everything is contained in the latest guide. And as I mentioned, there's several billion dollars of opportunity over the next couple of years as we continue to execute on these programs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro research. Please proceed with your question.\nGeorge Shapiro: Good morning and again, congratulations to Bill and good luck to you, Chris.\nChris Kubasik: Thank you.\nGeorge Shapiro: These questions are a couple questions for Jay. You spelled out pension income as a benefit in Space, but not the other sectors. I would think other than Aviation it is pretty symmetrical. If you could just spell out how much of a contribution it was as well? And then, if you could just provide how much were public safety and commercial revenues down, and how did they, how were they on a sequential basis and what's the kind of rough numbers that we're at today? Thanks.\nJay Malave: Sure. George. So for pension, you're right. It was largest at SAS, but there were benefits across the portfolio. IMS benefited about 30 basis points. CS was very small about 10 and AS about 20 basis points from pension. Overall for the company about 30 basis points and all in. As far as the commercial businesses, PSPC was down low 20's and the Commercial Aviation was down a little bit below 50% in the quarter. So combined you're talking in the 30's sequentially. Commercial Aviation was slightly down from the fourth quarter, and PSPC is the same, slightly down. Some of that though is seasonality. It's not, I don't think the compares that great on a sequential basis it is better I think year-over-year. Fourth quarter I think is seasonally higher in both businesses.\nChris Kubasik: I'll just chime in George. Relative to PSPC, and I'm sure you've seeing the $1.9 billion COVID bill has about $360 billion for state and local municipalities. And the states have full discretion on how to spend that money. So I think that's going to give us more confidence in the PSPC recovery, most of which is with states and local municipalities. So I'm sure they're going to be trying to figure out between education, healthcare and public safety, how to spend that money. But I think just in the first quarter we tripled the number of proposals that we submitted. So I have confidence in the second half of the year we will start to see the recovery that Jay mentioned and I think we're all familiar with what's going on in Commercial Aviation, so again that's back end loaded as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey, good morning guys, thanks for taking the questions and congrats Bill and Chris. Maybe just going back a little bit to Ron's Space question, and kind of tying in where Peter and Jon were going on margins. At the business update kind of presentation last month, you kind of talked about within space and within the segment there around this sort of factory business model with these newer constellations laying out a path towards I guess, four times as many deliveries. How do we think about the move in that production and the higher volumes and presumably some of the leverage you'd get on better throughput, better purchasing? Is that going to be a big source of margin expansion outside of e3? It seems like you're taking on a much different production philosophy there.\nChris Kubasik: Yes Michael, well said. I think absolutely, that's going to be a contributor to our margins and coupled with volumes. So we talk a lot about the HPTSS SDA. We wonder down select, we're still in a competition, we're going to go ahead and focus on delivering those aircraft on time and getting them launched. And then, that's where the real opportunity kicks in, whether they keep two suppliers or go down to one. There's literally 10s if not more of satellites for decades to come. So the volume will also play into that and part of the e3 methodology and the focus on operational excellence is really taking Space and making it more of a factory type concept and mindset and we have those capabilities. We do it in other parts of the company, and we're sharing those best practices. So, each and every one of those will contribute. So, thank you for that final, final question, Michael. And let me just wrap it up. I think you've heard throughout the day here that we've had a solid start to the year with exceptional execution and healthy string of awards. Obviously, that wouldn't be possible without the dedication and hard work of our 48,000 employees. So clearly, I appreciate everything they're doing. I'm excited about the rest of the year, as we finally hopefully put the pandemic related impacts behind us. We enter the final stages of integration, and we make more progress as a unique non-traditional defense tech company. But before concluding, I also have to thank Bill for his leadership and contribution to the company and congratulate him on a great run. So Bill, I've enjoyed working alongside you the last two years. I'm proud of what we've created together here with L3Harris and more to go. So, thank you.\nBill Brown: Likewise, thank you, Chris.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Okay, well thank you Bill, and I appreciate your and the Board's vote of confidence and look forward to our continued partnership in your new role. As you've heard at our investor briefing last month, we're excited about the potential for the company and the value creation opportunities in front of us. The strategic priorities we develop together as shown on Slide 3, are the foundations, on which will deliver sustainable topline growth, steady margin expansion and robust free cash flow with industry-leading capital returns, all areas where we showed great progress in the first quarter. In terms of the top line, our Q1 results coupled with the Biden administration's announcement that the defense budget will continue to grow in FY '22 about 1.5 points versus FY '21 reinforces our optimism for growth. We are encouraged by the continued focus on national security and support for our military within the budget and believe L3Harris is well aligned with priorities that emphasize the return to peer competition and operations in increasingly contested environments. This backdrop provides us opportunities to offer our advanced and affordable solutions across all domains. We are watching closely for more details in the coming months and expect to consistently grow through our strong DoD portfolio, revenue synergies, and international expansion which stem from our R&D investments. In the first quarter, we gained traction as we grew 4.8% in our core government businesses with international up double-digits driven by solid growth in aircraft ISR and tactical radios. Turning to revenue synergies, we received 8 new awards maintaining our healthy win rate of about 70% with total awards to date of approximately $400 million. We anticipate sustaining our momentum given notable prime level awards across all domains that represent multibillion-dollar opportunities. On the Space side, in addition to our recently highlighted HBTSS Responsive Satellite Award with the Missile Defense Agency, our five decades of experience building space-based imaging systems has led to our down select for the initial concept and design of next generation weather imagers. This award supports NOAAs future satellite system recapitalization. The administration's focus on climate initiatives supported by nearly 30% FY '22 budget increase for NOAA, reinforces the opportunity set for L3Harris as we are a leader in weather payload and ground systems, creating an opportunity of $3 billion over the next decade. On the air side, we have strong orders on both new platforms, such as the F-35 and legacy platforms, including the F-18 and F-16. In particular, we leveraged our experience with providing F-16 systems and our expertise in software defined open systems architecture to secure a contract to develop the next-generation electronic warfare suite on international aircraft. We can further expand our global footprint with opportunities in more than a dozen countries, in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe. This adds to our recent success with the US Navy's next-generation jammer low band award for the EA-18G Growler. We're quickly establishing ourselves as a global leader in electronic warfare and aircraft survivability. We also closed on the ISR aircraft contract with the NATO customer to missionize a series of G550s that was still pending parliamentary approval last quarter, and we continue to work on similar opportunities for other customers, which when combined with the NATO award demonstrates our ability to expand our international footprint and represents over 3 billion of potential value over the next several years. Moving over to the land side, we continue to make progress supporting modernization efforts on both the domestic and international fronts, including a follow-on production order under SOCOM's $255 million multichannel Manpack IDIQ contract. We also received orders for our advanced radio and night vision products from Western Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia, further strengthening our international leadership. And finally, in the sea and cyber domains, our maritime team was successful in winning two new prime level programs to provide imaging systems on submarines for international customers. These strategic wins highlight our ability to expand our global maritime solutions to new customers with additional follow-on opportunities to come. And while limited in what we can say, due to its classified nature, our billion dollar Intel & Cyber business received a follow-on order to provide end-to-end mission solutions within its ground-based adjacency franchise as we continue to deliver against our customers' most challenging cyber requirements. These wins provide long-term visibility and support for our funded book-to-bill of 1.10 in the quarter. Our total backlog remains above $21 billion, up 6% year-over-year when adjusted for divestitures. In addition, with considerable recent biding proposal activity we're aggressively going after a three-year $125 billion pipeline to deliver sustainable topline growth. Shifting over to margins, this quarter we saw the healthiest results since the merger at nearly 19%, which puts us in a strong position to meet the upper end of our full year guidance. Cost synergies of $33 million, primarily attributable to supply-chain and facilities consolidation, put us well on track to deliver up to $350 million of cumulative net benefits in 2021, a year ahead of schedule. Our e3 program also gained traction through a strong program performance, factory productivity and supply chain savings. And we continue to believe that there is considerable potential beyond this year to enable another phase of cost opportunities to sustain margin expansion for L3Harris. Lastly, we're maximizing cash flow through continued working capital and CapEx discipline, driving shareholder friendly capital deployment. And while we're holding off on updating our $2.3 billion share repurchase target for the year, based on our announced and potential divestitures, we still see considerable up-side to the plan. As an update on portfolio shaping, we've recently cleared the U.S. antitrust waiting period on both the previously announced Military Training and Combat Propulsion Systems divestiture and are on track to closing the second half of the year. We're progressing on other portfolio shaping opportunities and we'll provide more details over the coming months. And to reiterate, inclusive of divestitures, we remain on track to deliver on our $3 billion free cash flow commitment in 2022 along with double-digit cash growth on a per share basis excluding potential tax policy impacts. So, we're pleased with the execution against our strategic priorities and progress we've made at the start of the year, which gives us confidence to raise the bottom end of our EPS guidance. So, with that, I will hand it over to Jay. Okay Sheila, thank you very much. Let me start with International. You're right we did have a good quarter with double-digit growth. We had book-to-bill of 1.3. As I mentioned, the aircraft ISR, the Tactical Radios and Maritime were the key drivers. Looking at our pipeline, we have about $35 billion of opportunities over the next three years, so really impressed with the team's work as we position ourselves for future growth. You know it all started with the strategy that we laid out, it's really a two-part strategy, one focusing on the mission systems and the larger programs such as the ISR platforms we have talked about working in tandem with our sales force, which is out there with the products. So, when you look at the Radios, the Night Vision Goggles, the WESCAM, EO/IR turrets, it's a nice complement. So, I think the diversity of our portfolio and the geography with customers in over a 100 countries really positions us well for continued growth. Shifting to the Space question, the Space business is part of SAS. You know I kind of look at it in four buckets. On the low end we have some products, some telemetry and antennas. We do some groundwork, which I think is important to better understand the mission and to support some of these classified constellations. They tend to be mid-single-digit growth, but it's all about the SATs. Historically, we've been on the exquisite satellites as a supplier or a subcontractor. GPS III and classifieds SATs come to mind, but the responsive satellites is really where we've moved the needle last year or so and we're optimistic in the future. So, that's the fastest growing part of the portfolio, double-digits growth for the year. We've talked about the ZEUS program. We talked about SDA Tracking, HBTSS and a fair amount of classified bids that we are working on today. So, hope that gives you a little bit of granularity and insight as to how we are growing Space. Thank you, Rob. Sure Rob. There's nothing unusual that was in the results, but a little bit of R&D timing and so we'll see a little bit of pressure there. But the more significant kind of factor that will normalize the margins towards the balance of the year, will really be related to the newer programs. As you know we've got Army HMS programs in the back half of the year. We also have programs like the Next Gen Jammer in the Broadband business and so those will likely put some pressure on the back half of the year on the margins. I'll just, you know, the broader comment I would say is, it's a great start, maybe this is an indication of how to look, think about things perhaps in the future, but we will see a little bit of a normalization here in the subsequent three quarters. Okay, thank you for that question, a great, great question and it ties into the strategy that we've talked about. You mentioned NOMARS, which is an interesting opportunity, that's the No Manning Required Ship, a recent DARPA win, which I think is pretty interesting relative to what the Navy is trying to accomplish. Because as you know historically, we've taken manned ships and tried to convert them into unmanned, and this is an early stage design program, where we would be, we are one of three winners if you will. And it's really starting with a clean sheet of paper. How would you design a ship knowing it was going to be unmanned from the beginning? So, on that one it'll be interesting to see how that progresses. The follow-on will be 2022, which will probably be a prototype. And in that case we team with -- we have a variety of teammates and we would probably team with shipbuilders, so we are not going to be investing in a shipyard in that case. I think generally we are pleased with the footprints and the size of our facilities. We talked about space and some of the growth and we took some existing facilities and modified them and re-laid out the footprint to optimize the flow with new tooling and such. So, we spend a $1 billion a year between CapEx and IRAD. CapEx is about 2% of our revenue. I think that will drift down over time. IRAD is industry leading and it is almost 4%. So, the $1 billion I think positions us well. I do not see any increase in overhead or significant CapEx to meet our strategy. And again most of what we're working on are the systems versus the actual platforms, so does not take up as much factory space, if you will. Yes, thanks Carter. No we do not -- the first question we do not have exposure in ISR in Afghanistan. Total exposure there is in the $10 million range of revenue and a fair amount of that is just ground systems, so not significant. Great question on the pipeline and the capture rates, and I think you're right, I think we've surprised people with some of the wins that we've had, but it really aligns with what we're hearing from our customers and they're change in acquisition process. They really are looking for disruptive and innovative and agile and affordable solutions and that's what we've been providing. We do track our win rates at the company level and you don't necessarily, if they're too high, it suggests that we haven't opened the aperture and been as aggressive as we would like. So, we track those on a segment and an overall basis and 125 billion over three years, if we were successful in at least 50% that easily tracks to a mid-single digit growth targets, and then on top of that we have the revenue synergies that we've talked about. So, we're comfortable with what we've done. We have professionalized the business development function I believe, and we're starting to see the results from that. Yes, thanks Ron. I think there's been some opportunities in commercial space where some of our payloads, I think we could provide to the primes. As far as us investing in our own constellations or expanding capital is not currently in our strategic plan. Of course, you know we have exposure or capabilities that support the launch vehicles which launch both military and commercial satellites, so we have some opportunities there as well. But as far as being a prime in the commercial space market at this time does not align with our strategic plan. Okay Seth, let me first start with some of the accomplishments we've had in Tactical Radios and then I'll hand over the ball to Jay to give you the specific numbers. I mean, we are off to a very good start in 2021 as you saw in the press release. You know on the DoD side, couple of highlights here. The Army HMS Manpack recently completed the IoT in the last year was in the process of going through the DOT&E, Test and Evaluation recently. And the good news is, we just received an RFP for the full rate production. So I think that's a great sign that the modernization is moving forward. In a month or so, the Army should be issuing its HMS Leader Radio RFP, again for full rate production. So, I think that again is an additional positive sign. The Marines recently released an RFP for their Hand Held Radio and the SOCOM business has been growing. We've been meeting milestones. And in my prepared comments I've mentioned an order there for the Multichannel Manpack. So, just gives you some flavors to how the business is doing on the DoD side. Internationally, we have good visibility in Saudi. Last year we booked $174 million order for the Ministry and National Guard, so we'll have that revenue run out through this year and we're working closely with the land forces on the Software Defined [ph] Radio for about 5000 initially, so that's going through the Saudi process. Europe and UK we had good growth. UK the MORPHEUS program is going to replace the BOWMAN radio. So, we are hoping to hear something later this year. So, again I feel pretty confident in what we've done. And Australia, last year we talked about the Delphic Crypto Standard upgrade and new radios for Australia. There's follow-on opportunities there. And of course New Zealand is also a customer that we are working closely with. So, kind of operationally or business development wise I wanted to give you some insight to what's going on and Jay will provide you the numbers you requested. Absolutely Myles. I'll give you some background, maybe it's going to be longer answer than you'd like, but I think it's important to kind of calibrate everything, and then I'll ask Jay to maybe give you some of the financial implications. But you're right, I've personally been involved around F-35 for twenty some years as well as many of our senior execs. So, I think that that's an important point and we all absolutely are committed to this platform, which I think is one of the best aircraft in the world. So, L3Harris and legacy companies, we've been a supplier for over twenty years. We have a really good track record. A few months ago we delivered our 2 millionth part and we're like 99.9% on time delivery. So, a lot of the work historically has been with TR2, the Tech Refresh 2, weapons release displays, but your questions specific to TR3, Tech Refresh 3, which is a very complicated developmental program to meet some of the new challenges that our nation faces. So, you're right, we've realized some of the risks, two main drivers, we've realized risk that we had identified and thought could occur when we bid the program. And secondly, as it was referenced in the testimony, there have been numerous government directed changes. So, those are unfortunate, but not unexpected when you're in a developmental program. We are working on three main products, the AMS, the Advanced Memory System, the PCD, which is the Panoramic Cockpit Display and the ICP, which is the Integrated Core Processor. So, we've been stable for the last six months relative to our cost estimates and our schedule. The AMS and PCD hardware are starting qualification and ICP is just behind that. So, when you look at how important the TR3 is, it's a step change in capability. It's half the cost of the TR2 once it gets into production and it's been designed for easier affordability and sustainment. So, we're just about ready to kick off the production phase. I will say that our past financials and our current guidance reflect our performance. We don't anticipate any changes there. And then strategically, these capabilities that we're developing are going to put us in a position to leverage this technology on other products, platforms and future programs. So, we're excited about that, but maybe Jay can comment more specifically on the revenue and the margin implications. Doug, thank you. First of all, it's Chris. You're right, the integration and the cost synergies, I think, has been a great success. As I mentioned, we're a year ahead of schedule. And it really goes back to after we announced and before we closed, we had a dedicated team, the integration management office that really laid out in detail a plan to go ahead and capture these cost synergies. And that's something that Bill, Jay and I have been meeting and continue to meet every Monday to review the progress. And it takes time, especially something like IT, as we've been consolidating our ERP systems, investing in the infrastructure and going with new applications, relative to it. So that should wrap up by the end of this year and then we'll focus entirely on the e3 process. It's really becoming part of the culture, and we identify projects, we review them on a weekly basis. And these are just lots of singles and doubles, couple $100,000 here, $1 million there. And we go sector-by-sector, segment-by-segment. And world class organizations continually take out 2% to 3% of their costs each and every year over and above the increase in salaries and others. So we're having good momentum. We have good visibility. We came out strong this quarter, if you see it for the year. And my expectation is that we absorbed the headwinds, and we continue to go forward. So I don't know if anyone has anything further. Yes, thanks for the question, Kristine. I'll start and then give it over to Jay to give you the specific numbers. One, line that we're not cutting and I think I've said this back in the March meeting. And again, you look at what we're investing on the front end of the business and R&D and industry leading them out. I said before, we did not cut R&D, we could have cut R&D and increase the margins further, but we aren't. We're taking a long term approach. The investments we have in bid and proposal of which were submitting lots of proposals. The R&D and direct sale expenditures have generally increased as we try to focus on the front end of the business. You know, we talked about the revenue synergies, important part of our success is the workforce and we actually started day one of the merger with negative synergies as we increased the costs and the benefits to make sure our workforce was fully engaged and supported. So that's, that the headwinds and the items I look at to give me confidence that again, we're not looking at this short term, quite the contrary, we're looking longer term. And we're taking an enterprise wide approach. So we talked about shared services as an example, there's lots of companies out there that had individual segments or sectors, doing their own processing, whether it's payables or payrolls. Some of this stuff isn't overly exciting, but going to a shared service concept, having single process, single systems, and optimizing for the benefit of the enterprise versus individual divisions, sectors or segments is I think part of the strategy. And a lot of people say it, it's not easy to do, and we're doing it, so whether it's procurement, whether it's quality, e3 shared services, all those things we're looking at, at an enterprise level, taking out the inefficiencies. And there's more work to do in the years ahead and that's what gives us confidence. But Jay, do you want to maybe give more detail? Yes, thanks, Peter. Now we apply e3 not only to the fixed price contracts, but the cost plus. When we talk about the portfolio that we've built, and how we're positioned in all these domains, a lot of these programs that start out is cost plus or developmental have a long life, sometimes decades, right. So they move into full rate production and then of course, fair amount have potential for international export. So we look at it as a portfolio and then the natural, healthy growing business, you are going to have the headwind mix from the development programs, which will take every day of the week, but the rest of the portfolio is continuing to mature through its cycle. And as I mentioned, F-35 is a good example. We're getting through the TR3, and then we'll be starting in our production. And that program should have a lot of legs as an example. EW is part of SAS, now we've had good success of light, as I mentioned with the F-16 as a specific example. We have legacy programs on the F-18. We don't talk a whole lot about the cyber business, but that's growing. And again, there's a commercial model aspect to our cyber business that allows us to have licensing and other opportunities to grow margins. So that's pretty much how I look at it. And again, we continue to have confidence, even with the cost plus piece of the portfolio. Sure. So in SAS in particular, we expect in their case R&D to tick up in the back half of the year and so that's one. And then as well as just programs growth on some of these new wins is going to drive margins down just on the lower initial margins I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So for us those are just two factors, pick up in R&D and then a pick up in the lower margin new programs. Thank you, as do I. Yes, Noah, all those items that didn't quite cross the goal line in December were in fact booked in Q1. So the guide represents those programs that have been booked, the results are in the quarter and for the year. So we're very optimistic. I mean, the ISR business, when you take this NATO customer, plus what we've done in Australia, and here in the U.S. with the C3D [ph] program, there's still lots of legs in aircraft ISR. So everything is contained in the latest guide. And as I mentioned, there's several billion dollars of opportunity over the next couple of years as we continue to execute on these programs. Thank you. I'll just chime in George. Relative to PSPC, and I'm sure you've seeing the $1.9 billion COVID bill has about $360 billion for state and local municipalities. And the states have full discretion on how to spend that money. So I think that's going to give us more confidence in the PSPC recovery, most of which is with states and local municipalities. So I'm sure they're going to be trying to figure out between education, healthcare and public safety, how to spend that money. But I think just in the first quarter we tripled the number of proposals that we submitted. So I have confidence in the second half of the year we will start to see the recovery that Jay mentioned and I think we're all familiar with what's going on in Commercial Aviation, so again that's back end loaded as well. Yes Michael, well said. I think absolutely, that's going to be a contributor to our margins and coupled with volumes. So we talk a lot about the HPTSS SDA. We wonder down select, we're still in a competition, we're going to go ahead and focus on delivering those aircraft on time and getting them launched. And then, that's where the real opportunity kicks in, whether they keep two suppliers or go down to one. There's literally 10s if not more of satellites for decades to come. So the volume will also play into that and part of the e3 methodology and the focus on operational excellence is really taking Space and making it more of a factory type concept and mindset and we have those capabilities. We do it in other parts of the company, and we're sharing those best practices. So, each and every one of those will contribute. So, thank you for that final, final question, Michael. And let me just wrap it up. I think you've heard throughout the day here that we've had a solid start to the year with exceptional execution and healthy string of awards. Obviously, that wouldn't be possible without the dedication and hard work of our 48,000 employees. So clearly, I appreciate everything they're doing. I'm excited about the rest of the year, as we finally hopefully put the pandemic related impacts behind us. We enter the final stages of integration, and we make more progress as a unique non-traditional defense tech company. But before concluding, I also have to thank Bill for his leadership and contribution to the company and congratulate him on a great run. So Bill, I've enjoyed working alongside you the last two years. I'm proud of what we've created together here with L3Harris and more to go. So, thank you."

            "name": "Jay Malave",
            "content": "Thank you, Chris and good morning everyone. First, let me begin with a brief recap of the quarter before I get into segment results. Organic revenue was up about 2% as growth in IMS, SAS and CS was partially offset by the expected decline in AS due to the pandemic. Overall, our core government businesses were up 4.8% reduced by about 3 points of COVID related impacts in our commercial businesses. Margins expanded 140 basis points to 18.9% with expansion in all four segments, primarily from operational excellence, integration benefits and cost management. We did better than expected in the quarter from stronger e3 and cost synergies of roughly 70 basis points as well as some timing benefits from lower R&D and program mix of approximately 50 basis points. This, along with share repurchase activity led to earnings per share growth of 14% or $0.38 to $3.18 as shown on Slide 6. Of this growth, synergies and operations contributed $0.34, along with a lower share count, pension and interest totaling $0.23 which offset divested earnings and headwinds, prevent the pandemic impact to end markets. Free cash flow of $630 million was the result of solid net income drop through as well as CapEx and working capital discipline with days roughly steady at 55. And shareholder returns of $909 million were comprised of $700 million in share repurchases and $209 million of dividends. Now let's turn to Slide 7 and discuss quarterly segment results. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was up 5.9% with growth in all three businesses. Double-digit growth in maritime from our ramp unmanned platforms, including the Columbia Class submarine and Constellation Class frigate, was complemented by growth in ISR from the NATO award carryover from last year and in electro-optical from deliveries of our WESCAM airborne turrets to the U.S. Army. Operating income was up 19% and margins expanded 180 basis points to 16.5% from cost management, integration benefits and operational excellence. Funded book-to-bill was impressive at over a 1.3 in the quarter. In Space & Airborne Systems organic revenue increased 4.1% from responsive programs including SDA tracking and HBTSS, driving high single digit growth in Space, as well as growth from the F-35 platform in Mission Avionics and double-digit classified growth in Intel & Cyber. This strength is partially offset by program timing in electronic warfare. Operating income was up 8.6% and margins expanded 90 basis points to 19.4% from cost management, including R&D timing, operational excellence, and higher pension income. Funded book-to-bill was a solid 1.15 for the quarter from strong bookings in our Space and Electronic warfare businesses. Next, Communication Systems organic revenue was up 2.9% with high single digit growth in tactical communications, primarily from the continued ramp in U.S. DoD modernization. It also drove integrated Vision Solutions and Global Communication Solutions up double digits. Conversely, volume was lower on legacy unmanned platforms within broadband due to the transition from permissive to contested operating environments and within public safety due to anticipated COVID related impacts that are now showing signs of stabilization. Operating income was up 12% and margins expanded 240 basis points to 25.3% from operational excellence, cost and management and integration benefits. Funded book-to-bill was 0.92 for the quarter. Finally, in Aviation Systems organic revenue decreased 8.3%, primarily driven by COVID related impacts in our commercial aviation business, consistent with expectations and from program timing in military training. High single digit growth in Mission Networks from higher FA volume [ph] paired with fusing and ordinance [ph] growth in defense aviation hope to offset these effects. As we move past the first quarter, we're anticipating a return to growth in this segment as we lap COVID effects while our combined government businesses continue to grow. Operating income was down 13%, primarily from the sale of our airport security and automation businesses. Margins expanded 120 basis points to 15.7% as operational excellence, cost management, including R&D timing, and integration benefits more than offset COVID related headwinds. Funded book-to-bill was 0.84 for the quarter. Okay, let's shift over to 2021 guidance. We're off to a strong start with our first quarter results and performance and we're confident in our integration and operating expectations, as well as our topline growth of 3% to 5%, supported by a solid 1.10 book-to-bill this quarter. This puts us in a position to raise the bottom end of our full-year EPS guidance by $0.10 inclusive of announced divestiture impacts. We will provide a more comprehensive update later in the year. In the interim, I'll provide some color now on the moving pieces, specifically on margins, portfolio shaping, and capital returns. On margins, the strong start will likely push us toward the upper end of our range of 18% to 18.5%. We do expect margins to normalize for the balance of the year due to increases in R&D and stronger growth in new programs with lower initial margins. Overall, the expected upside for the year from our prior midpoint is due to strong program execution and cost performance. It will be a key factor in our 2021 earnings strength. Our portfolio shaping, we now expect about $0.10 of dilution from announced divestitures, net of buybacks from proceeds. And there are a few remaining businesses that are in various stages of the divesture process which could have a modest incremental EPS impact for the year. Lastly, as highlighted at our Investor briefing, we have another significant year planned for capital returns. Embedded in our guidance is $2.3 billion of share repurchases from cash generation, which will be further augmented by over $1 billion dollars in net divestiture proceeds. So, overall, for 2021 we're confident in delivering on our commitment of double-digit annual growth in earnings and free cash flow per share. With that Rob, let's open up the line for questions. And Richard, when you think about CapEx for the moment, we -- over this next this year as well as the next few years, we have investments in our IT systems as we're consolidating our platforms. We also have investments as we're moving facilities and consolidating facilities. So, as those trail off that will create capacity to invest in new programs over the next few years. So we don't really see significant new requirements from where we are at the levels today in CapEx. Sure, Seth. So, I will give you the numbers in the format we've historically provided. Orders were $424 million, sales 474, of the sales DoD was 297, International was 177, and our funded backlog was 958. Related to your question on Army modernization about third of the DoD is Army modernization and you know that will continue to grow particularly as we are going to full rate production on the Army HMS modernization in the back half of this year. Yes, just going forward maybe over the next few years, our ship set content today is a little bit over $2.5 million around 2.6, with the TR3 production with Lot 15, that will go to around $3 million per ship set. So, as and that again starting Lot 15, as the aircraft volumes start to flatten out we will see growth just through higher content. It's important to keep in mind that as this modernization program there probably will be other modernization programs that will be involved in and of course it will also be part of sustainment program. And so, we see this as continuing to drive growth. I think we'll update it as each year progresses. This year as Chris mentioned is a little bit softer from a growth perspective but we expect that to pick up next year. Okay. David, just to be clear on the 12.85 that does anticipate or include the $0.10 of expected dilution from the announced divestitures, so that's in the 12.85.As far as the announced divestitures' impact going forward on AS margins, it's about 100 basis points dilutive. So, the margins on these two businesses composite a little bit higher than the average going forward. That again changes I guess downstream, we'll see with organic improvements, but just baseline impact of the divestiture is about 100 basis points. I'll just say, it's, as you would expect and as you know, it's management attention, both the synergy program, and the e3 Operational Excellence Programs went parallel paths from day one of the merger. We've had separate reviews and go through all of those. And these reviews are monthly. So the management system, we expect to continue that we had started from day one of the merger. And we have monthly reviews with each of our segments as Chris mentioned, we go through the top 10, the top 15 programs and e3 Operational Excellence Program to make sure that they're on track. And so it's simple as management attention, focus, and continuing to drive the operational foundational basics of performing better each and every day. Yes, as far as specific initiatives, things that you've heard of in the past, whether it should cost value engineering, supply chain, shop productivity, just a specific example, in our ISR businesses, in terms of people, as you would expect, would be all over an aircraft tear down and build and rebuild. Simple things like changing the tooling, so that you get a benefit in ergonomics, as well as a hours reduction or minutes reduction in the rebuild of a particular aircraft. And so, we've been able to take tooling, in some cases, it's customer funded tooling. On top of it we're able to change our processes, improve them and take costs out at the same time. So it's not a we'll just slash costs, and hopefully it sticks. These are more systemic type reductions that we have an organization built around to drive continuous improvement in sustainable reductions. Now, that Dan is still early in the year and in my comments, I suggested this because it's high confidence to be at the higher end of the range, so we'll keep it updated and let you know if changes are warranted later in the year. Yes, so a little early to talk about our guidance for margins next year, but I will say that our goal each year is to continue to drive the margins up. You know, we've talked about a smaller ramp in expansion, but our goal always is that the e3 productivity Operational Excellence Program exceeds the headwinds from mix and that's what we will strive for each and every year. It's going to vary from year-to-year. So as we get into more specifics, as we put together our plan for next year, we'll be able to obviously give you more detail there. But the way you should think about it on average each year is continued drive up. It will slow from what we've seen in the last few years, but our expectation is to continue to grow. Sure. George. So for pension, you're right. It was largest at SAS, but there were benefits across the portfolio. IMS benefited about 30 basis points. CS was very small about 10 and AS about 20 basis points from pension. Overall for the company about 30 basis points and all in. As far as the commercial businesses, PSPC was down low 20's and the Commercial Aviation was down a little bit below 50% in the quarter. So combined you're talking in the 30's sequentially. Commercial Aviation was slightly down from the fourth quarter, and PSPC is the same, slightly down. Some of that though is seasonality. It's not, I don't think the compares that great on a sequential basis it is better I think year-over-year. Fourth quarter I think is seasonally higher in both businesses."

            "content": "Well, thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today we reported strong first quarter results, building on last year's progress with solid execution across all financial metrics. Organic revenue was up approximately 2% with mid-single-digit growth in our core government businesses, partially offset by COVID-related impacts of about 3 points from our commercial businesses, consistent with our expectations. This should be the last quarter of tough compares due to the pandemic which our team has managed incredibly well and we anticipate more stability in the affected businesses ahead. Margins expanded a robust 140 basis points to 18.9% resulting in earnings per share of $3.18, up 14% and ahead of internal targets. Free cash flow of $630 million supported shareholder returns in excess of $900 million, including repurchases of $700 million from our recently authorized $6 billion program with the balance from dividends following our 20% increase in March. Before handing it over to Chris, with the transition occurring as planned on June 29, this quarter marks my 38th and final earnings call leading Harris and in L3Harris as CEO. It has been rewarding nearly 10 years with the hard work and dedication of our employees, Harris grew from a small niche defense company to a leading mission solutions defense prime post the acquisition of Exelis and the merger with L3 with revenue today of over $18 billion. I am especially proud of the people at L3Harris who work hard every single day to support our customers' critical missions and deliver value to shareholders. The performance culture and the work environment we've created is really special, and we recently were recognized for it by Fortune as a 100 best company to work for in 2021, and earlier this year as the world's most admired company. As you know, I'll continue as Exec Chair of the Board for another year working closely with Chris as he becomes CEO. Last week, the independent Directors of the Board unanimously endorsed the transition occurring as planned in the merger agreement indicating their confidence and mind in Chris's ability to lead this company going forward. The results today speak to the momentum we have in the company and the strong foundation we've built for the future, and I am excited and optimistic about what L3Harris can accomplish in its next phase under Chris's leadership. So with that, Chris let me turn it over to you. Hey thanks. Thanks Dave. And it's similar with IMS as well, again for them, it's program timing, particularly in the maritime business. They've been a lot of new wins in that sector. Chris mentioned, we had mentioned before, things like the Medium Unmanned Surface Vehicle. Also the other programs that they've won is just going to drive a little bit lower margin in the back half of the year as we ramp up those particular programs. Thank you, Noah. Likewise, thank you, Chris."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, and you may now begin.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. We published our investor letter after the market close yesterday. So today's call will primarily be focused on answering your questions. Joining me for the call are Chris Kubasik, our CEO; and Michelle Turner, our CFO. A few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our investor letter and SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. Before going to questions, Chris will make some brief comments.\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. As we reported yesterday, our fourth quarter came in ahead of expectations, and our 2023 guidance points to steady or improving trends. We've also been active on the M&A front, consistent with our strategy, as opportunities present themselves. Let's start with Q4. The team delivered a solid top line, up 6% organically, with Communications leading the way as we saw improvements in electronic component availability within tactical comms. This contributed to the second consecutive quarter of organic growth for our company. Segment margins were about what we expected, with ongoing pressures from macro factors, including inflated costs for material and labor. The net of this is EPS just above our recently guided midpoint and free cash flow at our $2 billion outlook. Turning to 2023. We're consistent with what we said on the last call: Expanding our revenue in the 2% to 4% range, including the Link 16 acquisition, while holding our industry-leading margins steady at about 15.5%. EPS adjusted for pension headwinds points to a stable operating results, and we're expecting an improving cash flow profile. Lastly, on recent M&A activity, we've previously discussed an opportunistic approach within our balanced capital allocation framework. We had opportunities to acquire two unique assets in ViaSat's Tactical Data Link business and Aerojet Rocketdyne. We closed TDL in 13 weeks and are off to a strong start with integration. In fact, our newest employees are already on the L3Harris payroll system and participating in our 401(k) and benefit programs. This acquisition positions us well to play a central role in networking and resiliency for global defense customers and fills in a needed capability as we develop our JADC2 solutions. Regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne, it's a national asset critical to future warfare that has a leadership position in propulsion, adding exposure to new growth markets for us with munitions, space exploration and hypersonics. It brings nearly $7 billion of backlog and tailwinds driven by global demand. With both of these acquisitions, we'll utilize our recent experience from our merger of equals. We expect much of the integration work for TDL to be complete once we bring Aerojet Rocketdyne into L3Harris. We'll hold an Investor Day later in the year to talk more about the strategy and outlook for our growing company. So we're building momentum with our strategy and look forward to executing on our performance first initiative in 2023. With that, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Harned: Good morning. Thank you.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning, Doug.\nDoug Harned: Yeah. Well, this question is going to have a few parts, I'm afraid because I want to understand a little bit more about your case for Aerojet Rocketdyne. I mean, you've talked a lot about it being a valuable asset. It diversifies your portfolio. But as you've also said, it's been a merchant supplier. So trying to understand, there are a few things here. When you look at it, what are some of the specific parts of the company that have potential for revenue synergy? Second, are there some areas of cost reduction there beyond just corporate costs? Because I know the facilities are difficult to move, for example. Third, are there things that you can do to improve operations and better performance for the end customers? And then last, when you're in this pre-close period, how do you ensure that the value of this asset doesn't deteriorate some over time?\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Well, thank you. Let me see if I can hit all of those. I'm sure there'll be several Aerojet Rocketdyne questions, but maybe I'll give a longer answer than usual and try to preempt some of those. So when we look at acquisitions, I'd like to start with the market. And when we're looking at the market data outside of platforms, the three largest global markets for defense are C2, which is command and control; sensors and weapons. So I'm very comfortable with how we're positioned on the first two, especially after the TDL acquisition. Our weapon presence in this $75 billion market is practically nonexistent. So we believe that weapons, munitions, missiles, whatever you want to call them, are absolutely aligned with the current and emerging customer demand. It is a growth market for the future fight. And solid rocket motors, especially for products like Javelin, STINGER, many that we know and hear about on a regular basis is a great way to position us in the missile and missile defense market. So I look at that from the munition side on the space, we have a long history of working with NASA and NOAA, so relative to space exploration and observation, we already have these relationships. We're honored or they're honored and soon us to be able to support SLS and Artemis, and there's visibility there for several years to come. And then the RL10 is a premium upper stage engine with well over 100 engines under contract with the ELA for the new Vulcan launch vehicle. And I think hypersonics doesn't really get the attention it deserves. And the other day, someone said hypersonics is the future. And the reality is hypersonics is now. And I think, this could be the crown jewel of the acquisition, and we believe there's significant growth opportunities that are well supported by the budget and the customers. So when I look at those three markets, I see growth. If I jump to the financials, if you will, as it relates to Aerojet Rocketdyne and what we can do, I mentioned the $7 billion of backlog, so longer cycle business gives us more visibility. I believe this will grow faster on the top line than our current portfolio. I believe we have the ability to improve margins and get those to be more in line with potentially what we're doing on a consolidated basis now over time. And there are several multi-year programs that will be coming up for renegotiation in the next year or two. And I believe as we continue to negotiate milestone payments, we'll be more cash favorable. So I throw that out there to maybe answer a couple of the questions. On the cost synergy, we believe there's something in the $50 million range easily from eliminating the public company cost and some of the duplicative overhead. You're right. We have no plans to move facilities, but I look at the footprint. We both have offices in D.C. We both have offices in Huntsville. There's some low-hanging fruit there, and we really didn't anticipate or plan at this point any synergies relative to supply chain. So we need to dig into that and of course, take the power of the new enterprise. So I think that that gets us on the - gets to your question, Doug, on cost synergies. And from L3Harris, we overachieved. And once we get into details, there's potential to continue to exceed those numbers from the cost synergy. Revenue synergy, given that these are new markets, and there's no overlap, we have no revenue synergies at this point in time. So that, I think, is a straightforward answer. I guess on the operations, it's clearly \u2013 I think we have great opportunities here to bring our skill set and enhance our \u2013 the performance of Aerojet Rocketdyne. And I look at what we did at L3Harris before the merger, look at the TR3 program as an example, and maybe our Waco facility. Both those locations are \u2013 the TR3 program was over budget in late. Waco facility was losing money. And with the scale of the new company, more talent, processes, policies, controls, the ability to attract new people, we were able to turn not only that program, but that business around. And I think those are the capabilities that we'll be able to bring to Aerojet Rocketdyne. Relative to pre-closing exposure, I don't think there's anything unique in this relative to other acquisitions. The integration team meets on a regular basis. I would think it's next week or the week after, we'll start having people on-site at some of these facilities as part of the integration process. As you would expect, Eileen Drake and I meet on a regular basis. So we, in fact, had a call yesterday and we have one every week and sometimes more. So I think that's how we're going to stay in touch, and we can do whatever we can to help them. I'm optimistic that this is going to be a very accretive and successful acquisition. We're excited. The employees are excited, and I apologize for the long answer, but I wanted to try to hit all five or six of your questions, Doug.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning.\nMichelle Turner: Good morning.\nRobert Stallard: Chris, I'll keep it to one following up from Doug's question though. When you looked at Aerojet and you look to the other levers you could pull on capital deployment, why did you think this is the best option for shareholders to go with versus continuing with the share buyback? Thank you.\nChris Kubasik: All right. Well, thank you. Well, first of all, it's consistent with our strategy. I think I've been talking for several years. We're building a new company to provide more competition within the industry and to give the DoD alternatives. So, I've been pretty consistent in saying we want to grow organically and inorganically. Different companies have different portfolios. And when I looked at the market and the team looked at the markets and we saw the focus and growth on munitions, it seemed to be a gap. So, we think over the long-term to mid-term, you're going to look back on this and see why this thing makes so much sense. I tried to lay out for Doug some of the strategy and some of the trends. But this company has some awesome employees and great technologies, and a great legacy and I think there's going to be continued growth in munitions and space and hypersonics for the long-term. Relative to capital deployment, yes, so that -- it was a -- I don't want to say it was a pretty easy decision, but it was consistent with what we wanted to do. There aren't that many assets available in this industry. And when they come to -- come available, you got to make a decision and act on them. And I'm excited that we got TDL done in 92 days and the integration is already underway. So, we can focus on getting Aerojet Rocketdyne approved and then start the integration. If you look at the investor letter, I think it's page 14, has a nice pie chart that kind of lays out our capital deployment over a five-year period and it shows us a fair amount of balance. But I don't foresee us doing any acquisitions for a couple of years, as you would imagine. We have some non-core assets that we're going to sell, and we're going to use those proceeds to bring down the debt over the next few years. We'll keep annual dividend increases and remain competitive, as you would imagine. And then we'll repurchase shares probably at least $500 million a year to absorb any dilution and depending on cash flow and other dynamics, that number could increase as we go forward. So, Rob, I think, hopefully, that answered your question.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. Good morning, Chris and Michelle. Chris, just on your last point, you've clearly been busy augmenting the portfolio with TDL and Aerojet. But how do you think about IRAD spend in 2023 versus 2022? You noted in your EPS bridge us $0.10 of internal investment headwinds and input costs. So, what are some of the products that you're focused on and these technologies accelerators that you're working on? And how do they contribute to your top line returning to mid-single-digit growth?\nChris Kubasik: Yes. Good morning, Sheila. And yes, IRAD is something that we have been investing in year-over-year. We have industry-leading IRAD kind of in the 3.5% range. We've significantly increased what we call ERAD, our external R&D from customers. When I look at the two together, we're well over $2 billion. So we have a pretty good process to -- a very good process to prioritize how we spend that money. So I think through some of the exciting things, if I start in space, we're excited about the investments that we've made in some new optics that we'd refer to as replicated composite optics. Basically, this is a replacement for glass mirrors in telescopes made out of carbon graphite. So the exciting thing is it's about half the weight. It takes about two-thirds of the time to manufacture, and it's significantly less expensive. And we're going to be launching the first ever replicated optics in the middle of the year. So I think this is going to reduce risk. We'll see how it performs, but this could be a game changer for a satellite business. And the air and land domains with ViaSat, we're investing in the advanced Tactical Data Link with a lot more resiliency. So that's part of the whole strategy there to modernize Link 16. And I think we have the largest library of waveform. So we're very excited about that. And then, maybe on the maritime front, I'm pretty excited that our -- we've talked about our Iver vehicle in the past. This is our autonomous undersea vehicle, just recently has achieved the first ever repetitive submerged launch and recovery from a torpedo tube. This is a significant step for our company, and I think it gives us an opportunity to considerably enhance the nation's autonomous undersea capabilities. So trying to give you some tangible examples and each of those will result in new business programs of record and maybe give you some insight to what's coming out of all the money that we're spending, whether it's IRAD or ERAD. As you probably saw in the letter in other release, we have two new segment presidents join us this year, and I can speak for them and say as they went through our portfolio and looked at the IRAD and some of the things we're working on, both John and Sam were pretty excited about the potential. So thank you, Sheila.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Deuschle: Hey, good morning and congratulations on the progress this quarter. It's great to see.\nMichelle Turner: Good morning.\nScott Deuschle: Michelle, are there any large ISR missionization contracts and the guides that haven't been finalized yet, particularly on the international side? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether there's any timing-related downside risk from that. Or if that's more just an upside opportunity, if one or more contracts do go your way? Thank you.\nMichelle Turner: Yes. No, I appreciate the question, Scott, and thanks for this, because it is important to note that, as we think about our guide for this year, we did take a different approach on a couple of things. Our ISR missionization business is one of them. So to directly answer your question, no, there are not any large international ISR pursuits in the plan. We do have one domestic pursuit, which we're anticipating in the first half of the year. We already have the aircraft. So that's minimizing the risk, and it's funded from a budgetary perspective. It's our C3D program. So we have four aircraft tied around that. And I think this is important, because as we walk through the guide that, this, along with supply chain, were the two key components when we think about how 2022 played out that's really influencing how we're thinking about our guide for 2023. And so I'll just hit supply chain upfront, because I'm assuming we're going to get the question. I'd be disappointed if we didn't get the question. But when we look at our guide for the current year, what we're assuming is something consistent with what we did in the second half of 2022. Coming off of the strong Q4 results, we're incredibly proud of all the teams across our product based businesses in particular. So I want to do a shout-out to our Tactical Communications team, WESCAM, PSPC, along with commercial aviation. We had a really strong finish to the year. And as we're building on that momentum coming into 2023, we're assuming that we're having consistent results in the second half of 2022 throughout the full year of the 2023 guide. And so to your point, Scott, around using what we learned in 2022 and influencing our 2023 outlook, there's really two key components. One was around the ISR missionization demand. And although we're continuing to pursue a handful of those programs with budgets being up, we're optimistic that we're going to be able to land a contract. We thought it was prudent at this point to not put that into our guide and it would be upside.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to go back to Aerojet and thinking about these cost synergies, I know they had previously executed on a $240 million cost takeout program. It seems like all of those savings went to the customers. And I'm just thinking about maybe the lack of margin expansion we've seen there. There's, obviously, been challenges in the rocket motor supply chain. I think Raytheon has been pretty outspoken there. Northrop is picking up, I think, the entire GMLRS motor production this year. What's the status of their production system? Do you think you have to make any investments? Is that contemplated in the cost synergies? And I guess maybe your level of confidence in margin expansion at that entity?\nChris Kubasik: Yeah. Thank you, Michael. We do have confidence in margin expansion. I think when you look at the customer, or you look at the portfolio mix they have, it's like everybody in the industry, it's a combination of cost plus and fixed price. So I'm not sure it would all go back to the customer. It should obviously -- they should be able to keep it on the fixed price. But that's in the past. I'm looking going forward. Like any of these acquisitions, there are systems that are fragmented or maybe older technology just like when we put L3 and Harris together. Our IT organization knows how to convert these. I used my reference to ViaSat, the fact that those employees are already on our systems, and it hasn't even been a month. So most of the challenges, challenged program, and I know they've talked about it at length, seems to be at one facility. Like I said, we'll have people down there in the next week or two. And everything has been contemplated in our business case. One of the benefits of being a large -- part of a larger organization, again, this is an acquisition, not a merger, I just like to make a -- an important distinction. We are buying them. They're about one-tenth of our market cap, and this will be a quick integration relative to decisions that need to be made, and a lot of their systems will migrate on to ours, whether it's benefits, payroll, et cetera. On the ERP manufacturing execution systems, they've been putting those in. We're familiar with those systems, familiar with those systems, familiar with the technology. And all that has been contemplated. With our scale, we have the capital. We have the IRAD. We prioritize it, and we have the ability to invest as they have been doing to make them world class.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Seifman: Hey. Thanks very much, and good morning.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning.\nSeth Seifman: I wonder, if you could talk a little bit about the kind of the medium-term outlook for the Communications business. We recently saw a management change there, and the \u2013 the details of the management change suggest that you're looking for some really fresh and different thinking in a business that's been kind of the core of the earnings for the company. And we've seen some good growth in the radio budgets in recent years. But when we look out to the middle of the decade and beyond, it doesn't necessarily look as good. So, can you tell us about your medium-term thought process for communications?\nChris Kubasik: No. Absolutely, Seth. Yeah. I mean, Sam joined us at the beginning of the year. When I look \u2013 I know a few people were asking questions relative to Sam and the business. I mean, CS is a short-cycle business with a global footprint, a lot of Army and Marine business. And when I hired Sam, like I do everyone, I look first and foremost for someone who's a leader versus a manager. And everywhere he's been, he's had success strategically, operationally and financially. Whether it's Collins, Sikorsky, UTC, he's led production. He's led programs. He's familiar with foreign military sales, direct commercial sales and a lot of experience globally. So I have no doubt he's going to be very successful and add value to the corporation. When I look at the medium term on comms, I don't want to underestimate the significance of the ViaSat acquisition and the focus on \u2013 on JADC2 and the ability to connect the networks, which the customer has been talking about, it seems like, for a decade. And I'm sure there's frustration on their part that we haven't, as an industry, been able to \u2013 to get that across the goal line. So when I look at the tactical radio business, we continue to see growth in the low to mid-single digits, not only here domestically where the modernization is going to continue. Internationally, in the fourth quarter, we got another contract from Australia that has been a great customer of ours. So the visibility we see continues to look good as the modernization continues the need for resiliency continues. And then I still think there is ability for the \u2013 more of a soldier as a system that's been talked about, but never quite brought across the goal line. So we have the ENVG goggles. We have the radios. There's connectivity that can happen at the soldier level and also networks at a higher level. So it's a key part of our business. And I think anything, as I've said before, over the past year, you look at the war in Ukraine, the ability to communicate is critical to execute the fight of the future. And our resiliency and our capability is unique, and I think it's going to continue to grow for the foreseeable future.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nGautam Khanna: Hi. Good morning, guys.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning.\nMichelle Turner: Good morning.\nGautam Khanna: I was curious, Chris, if you could talk to where you guys are in the L3 kind of integration journey. Meaning a couple of years ago, you guys talked about $250 million of annual cost out for a number of years kind of moving from a holding company to an integrated business, et cetera, et cetera. I'm just curious where do you think you are on that journey? And then if you could just comment also on the supply chain and the pace of healing within it assumed in the guidance and what you saw in Q4? Thanks.\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Let me take the first part. I'll ask Michelle to talk about the supply chain. As part of our E3 continuous improvement initiative, I'd say we're never ever complete. We talked about a three-year plan to take out $500 million. We took out $660 million. We're going to stop trying to call out separately the one-time costs and the savings as we move into the next cycle of acquisitions. But I can assure it's an ongoing journey. I think we got the low-hanging fruit. We made a lot of progress. So, I'd say maybe we're two-thirds of the way through the integration. And when I look at the IT systems, the ERP systems have come down substantially. I think we used to say there were about 100. By the end of the year, we'll be in the 20s. So, that's good progress. We've got consistent manufacturing execution systems that we're implementing. The one in Greenville should be done this year. We have a couple in other facilities, done a good job on all the shared services. So, in that case, that would be done. The facility moves have been done. But the team is looking at each and every function and process and continuing to optimize it. So, like I said, we did the easy stuff and now we're going function-by-function, relooking at the policies, the procedures, the systems and continuing to look at ways to optimize the business, which will make us faster and ultimately take cash out. So, I'll go with two-thirds of the way through. I'll lateral to Michelle, see if she agrees with me and then have her give some supply chain insight.\nMichelle Turner: I always agree with you, Chris. But just to add a little bit more color, I think a great example of where we're continuing on this next phase is around our real estate and our footprint consolidation efforts. And so to Chris' point, we took the low-hanging fruit in the first couple of years. Byron Green and his real estate team have really been focused on what's the next phase of that. We're in the middle of a two-year plan to take out an additional 10% as a result -- 10% of our overall sites as a result of this current operating environment where we have more of a hybrid workforce. So, it's continuing to be an evolution that's going to continue to pay dividends for. It's really helping to offset some of the macro inflationary challenges that are permeating across the industry. And then just to give a little bit more color from a supply chain perspective, I talked about our 2023 guide. And the word I would use is -- to describe it as a balanced approach. Again, the guide assumes it's consistent with our second half 2022 performance. But just to make this a little bit more tangible, I think it's helpful to think about what's different as we think about 2023 versus what remains the same at the start of, say, 2022 or at the end of 2021. So, I'll illuminate a few things for you because I think it helps bound the risk as you think about our guidance. Frankly, it's how we're managing the business internally. So, what's the same? What's the same is we do continue to see hiccups from an overall supply chain ecosystem perspective. This is consistent across our industry and other industries. This is something that's become a bit of the new norm. What's also consistent is we do continue to be on a 90-day allocation process with our microelectronic chip manufacturers. And this is a really important point because even when we continue to see the improvements like we did within Q4, the reality is the insights that we're getting to our supply from a chip perspective is good for about 90 days out. Then it gets more nebulous as we get into the latter part of the year. And then finally, I know we've put some of this within our Q3 earnings call. But just a reminder, 25% of our portfolio, which is different than our peers, is tied to in product deliveries. But if we're short on chips or we're short on washers or nuts, we're not going to be able to deliver that radio or that turret. And so those things remain the same as you think about our 2023 guide. Now what is different, right? And we've been talking about a lot of this in 2022, but what's really different is those proactive actions that we took last year to be purposeful and focusing on the things we can control. They help to minimize the risk in 2023. And so just a reminder, engineering redesigns were a big focus for 2022. We get the full value of that benefit in 2023. Our alternate part bank within our Tactical Communications Systems business is up to 1,000 parts. That would have been at 100 parts in 2021. Our overall revenue base in terms of DPAS coverage, it's also increased double digits. So that aids in the prioritization of our supply and material availability. And then finally, I think this is the most important predictive indicator is the number of critical parts. When we started and we felt the most acute impact from supply chain was really in the second half of 2021. We had hundreds of critical part shortages at that time. Fast forward to where we are today, and we're in the 10s in terms of the impact and what we're having to manage through. So the way I would characterize this is we continue to see sequential improvement from a supply chain perspective. We're not out of the woods by any means. And so as a result, we're taking a balanced approach to 2023, and that's what's reflected in our guide.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Spingarn: Hi. Thank you. So Michelle, just on the back of all of that, it seems like the positives are there might support higher margins in 2023. Now I know the guidance range allows for that. But what would cause the downside?\nMichelle Turner: Yeah. No, great questions. So let me walk through from a margin perspective. I'll start from the overall enterprise, right? To your point, Rob, we are assuming flattish margins, 15.4, 15.5-ish. From a headwind perspective, we are assuming continued macro inflationary challenges of about $400 million, so about 2.5% of our overall revenue. And we also have some headwinds from a mix perspective. Chris talked about where we're investing in space. Kelly and her team are doing phenomenal in terms of growing the business. At the same time, however, that will be a drag on our margins. As these new programs come on board, we typically book them at lower rates. And as we mitigate the risk, we start to see the profitability in those programs improve. So from a headwinds perspective, inflationary, challenges and mix, that is being offset by our continued strong E3 savings program, as Chris alluded to earlier. Real estate is a great example of that. Another great example is the voluntary retirement program that we announced at the end of Q3 last year. That's going to help to pay dividends and offset the merit increases that we're planning for from a human capital perspective. And then we've also assumed some level of commercial pricing. To your point, specifically, Rob, like what is the downside? The downside, from my perspective is this continuation of the unknown unknowns from an inflationary challenge perspective, right? There was a lot that permeated within 2022 that it felt like it was more of a reactionary year. And so, as a result, we're doing everything that we can to control the controllables. And we will prudently manage through that as we make our way through 2023.\nChris Kubasik: And I'll just chime in that, if you recall, last time we talked about the importance of our workforce, keeping them engaged and motivated and focusing on some of the attrition. And recall, in October, we talked about some of the things we're doing that are unique. Michelle mentioned the increased merit. We also held all the benefit costs flat from an employee perspective. We've increased the budget for spot awards to recognize performance and some of the other initiatives. And that was a headwind and investments of over $100 million that we're absorbing in 2023 and that provides a little bit of a drag, but it was the right thing to do, and I'm confident it's going to pay off.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKristine Liwag: Hey. Good morning, guys. Chris, earlier you mentioned that the ViaSat deal closed 90 days ahead of expectations. Was this something that you did differently with this acquisition to help speed up the regulatory review? And how much of that playbook is applicable to the Aerojet Rocketdyne deal?\nChris Kubasik: Yes. Great question and good morning, Kristine. Yes, I said we closed it in 92 days. We have been forecasting mid-year. We made all the appropriate filings for HSR. We responded to all the questions within the 30-day period, for ViaSat that is. There are some international approvals. And I think when you just looked at it, it made a lot of sense, and we weren't sure how that process was going to play out. Relative to Aerojet Rocketdyne, mid-January, we made our HSR filing. We all know the FTC is reviewing it. We've been very responsive in answering their questions, and we'll see how that process works out. We're -- Eileen and I met with key customers jointly in the Pentagon to explain the rationale and answer their questions. So, I think it's just being transparent, being responsive and getting the data request in, in a timely manner, so the process can work. So we'll see how it plays out. But so far, everything is tracking.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Arment: Good morning, Chris, Michelle. Hey, Chris, the TD acquisition seems like it's a really great fit, as you kind of highlighted that you had two kind of capabilities. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about, if you see like a big product upgrade cycle or with that road map or what kind of opportunity it is for L3. Thanks.\nChris Kubasik: Yes. Thanks, Peter. Now look, we've talked about Link 16 being on 20,000 platforms. And that really gives us the ability to upgrade and modernize. So when I mentioned the IRAD we're spending on the advanced data tactical link, that's an obvious fit. One of the things we focused on in the negotiation, this was a carve-out. So that's a little unique as to what we buy, what we don't buy. And we really wanted to get access to a relatively small piece of the business, which was the Link 16 to space and Link 16 and Viasat's on the SDA transport. Later this year will be a launch. We will have the first-ever Link 16 capability in space. And I think, again, that's kind of the hidden jewel in this thing. There's going to be Link 16 in space. The connectivity from space to air is a game changer to focus on resiliency. So relative to revenue synergies, we're very excited about the potential here with ViaSat. So the upgrade is going to happen. We're investing in new products. We also have the existing product production that's going well. So I think we're going to look back on this one. It's going to look pretty successful and pretty straightforward and off to a good start. So hopefully, that helps.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Richard Safran with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nRichard Safran: Thanks. Chris, Michelle, Rajeev, good morning.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning.\nRichard Safran: Chris, last year, I'm going to try two, because I think they're quick. So your letter indicates you're getting compensated for inflation on new contracts. I was just wondering on existing fixed price contracts, is the government allowing you any adjustments based on higher unforeseen costs? And if so, would that the upside to your guide? Second question is Chris, just given your knowledge on \u2013 I asked this of your competitors. It seems to be just a general view that, as we move into a deficit reduction, defense is going to be the bill payer. I was kind of curious about, though, your view of sentiment on the Hill and for continued defense spending and funding modernization? Thanks.\nChris Kubasik: Yeah. Thanks, Rich. On the first one, we have not received any compensation for inflation on fixed price contracts nor have we asked for any. Similar to COVID expenses and others, we just absorbed it as part of the business. I just kind of feel like we survived the - these three years, and everything is looking much better on the upside. Obviously, if we got money, that would be upside. But as of now, we're just moving forward and focused on the new contracts. If something changes or if the DoD encourages us to bring forward a claim of some sort, we'll do it. But there have to be clear documentation. It's not as easy as you would think to prove that. On the deficit reduction, it's something we're all watching. I referenced in the letter. And we're excited to actually have a defense budget to start our fiscal year. So a shout-out to everybody in the lame-duck section \u2013 the lame-duck session for getting that done. And it's a big deal for us and a big deal for the industry and probably even a bigger deal for the Department of Defense. So I think that's the type of thing that gives us confidence in the future. I mean, one thing is for certain. It's really hard to predict how that's going to kind of play out. I'm really not in the camp that thinks DoD is going to be the bill payer. I know, there's some rhetoric around that. People say things to get different leadership positions in Congress. But when you look at the threats out there, it's just hard to justify flattening or reducing the defense budget, and it's a dangerous world. And that comes back to these acquisitions and looking what's going to matter at the end of the day and what the future fight is. And it's situational awareness with ISR, it's resilient comms, and it's munitions. So I like where we are relative to those positions, Rich.\nChris Kubasik: So I think with that, we'll wrap up. So I appreciate everybody calling in. I'm a big believer in momentum, and I feel like we have the beginning of some momentum with two consecutive quarters of growth, some acquisitions. I don't know if you can hear it in my voice and Michelle's, but we're really excited about the future and what the potential brings. And I know the initial feedback from the ViaSat employees has been all positive and the Aerojet Rocketdyne employees. And we've actually heard from many of the former Aerojet Rocketdyne employees who are also excited about the transaction. So, we're going to focus on the closing, get this deal done. And once it's closed, we're looking forward to connecting with any former Aerojet Rocketdyne employees and welcome them back if they're passionate about the mission. So, I think it's going to be an exciting couple of years. But before I sign off, I wanted to recognize and thank Dana Mehnert for his 38 years of service. As you know, Dana announced his retirement in Q4 and is assisting with a smooth transition. So, we appreciate that, Dana and wish him all the best in his future endeavors. And I want to turn it over to Michelle real quick.\nEnd of Q&A:\nMichelle Turner: So, thank you, everyone, for joining the call today and for your continued interest in our company. Before we disconnect, I just want to take a minute. As many of you know, this will be Rajeev's last earnings call with us. And I want to thank you, Rajeev, for your contributions in our Investor Relations function, overall L3Harris and for me, personally, for my transition over the last year. We all wish you the very best in this next adventure. So, thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Kubasik",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. As we reported yesterday, our fourth quarter came in ahead of expectations, and our 2023 guidance points to steady or improving trends. We've also been active on the M&A front, consistent with our strategy, as opportunities present themselves. Let's start with Q4. The team delivered a solid top line, up 6% organically, with Communications leading the way as we saw improvements in electronic component availability within tactical comms. This contributed to the second consecutive quarter of organic growth for our company. Segment margins were about what we expected, with ongoing pressures from macro factors, including inflated costs for material and labor. The net of this is EPS just above our recently guided midpoint and free cash flow at our $2 billion outlook. Turning to 2023. We're consistent with what we said on the last call: Expanding our revenue in the 2% to 4% range, including the Link 16 acquisition, while holding our industry-leading margins steady at about 15.5%. EPS adjusted for pension headwinds points to a stable operating results, and we're expecting an improving cash flow profile. Lastly, on recent M&A activity, we've previously discussed an opportunistic approach within our balanced capital allocation framework. We had opportunities to acquire two unique assets in ViaSat's Tactical Data Link business and Aerojet Rocketdyne. We closed TDL in 13 weeks and are off to a strong start with integration. In fact, our newest employees are already on the L3Harris payroll system and participating in our 401(k) and benefit programs. This acquisition positions us well to play a central role in networking and resiliency for global defense customers and fills in a needed capability as we develop our JADC2 solutions. Regarding Aerojet Rocketdyne, it's a national asset critical to future warfare that has a leadership position in propulsion, adding exposure to new growth markets for us with munitions, space exploration and hypersonics. It brings nearly $7 billion of backlog and tailwinds driven by global demand. With both of these acquisitions, we'll utilize our recent experience from our merger of equals. We expect much of the integration work for TDL to be complete once we bring Aerojet Rocketdyne into L3Harris. We'll hold an Investor Day later in the year to talk more about the strategy and outlook for our growing company. So we're building momentum with our strategy and look forward to executing on our performance first initiative in 2023. With that, let's open the line for questions. Good morning, Doug. Okay. Well, thank you. Let me see if I can hit all of those. I'm sure there'll be several Aerojet Rocketdyne questions, but maybe I'll give a longer answer than usual and try to preempt some of those. So when we look at acquisitions, I'd like to start with the market. And when we're looking at the market data outside of platforms, the three largest global markets for defense are C2, which is command and control; sensors and weapons. So I'm very comfortable with how we're positioned on the first two, especially after the TDL acquisition. Our weapon presence in this $75 billion market is practically nonexistent. So we believe that weapons, munitions, missiles, whatever you want to call them, are absolutely aligned with the current and emerging customer demand. It is a growth market for the future fight. And solid rocket motors, especially for products like Javelin, STINGER, many that we know and hear about on a regular basis is a great way to position us in the missile and missile defense market. So I look at that from the munition side on the space, we have a long history of working with NASA and NOAA, so relative to space exploration and observation, we already have these relationships. We're honored or they're honored and soon us to be able to support SLS and Artemis, and there's visibility there for several years to come. And then the RL10 is a premium upper stage engine with well over 100 engines under contract with the ELA for the new Vulcan launch vehicle. And I think hypersonics doesn't really get the attention it deserves. And the other day, someone said hypersonics is the future. And the reality is hypersonics is now. And I think, this could be the crown jewel of the acquisition, and we believe there's significant growth opportunities that are well supported by the budget and the customers. So when I look at those three markets, I see growth. If I jump to the financials, if you will, as it relates to Aerojet Rocketdyne and what we can do, I mentioned the $7 billion of backlog, so longer cycle business gives us more visibility. I believe this will grow faster on the top line than our current portfolio. I believe we have the ability to improve margins and get those to be more in line with potentially what we're doing on a consolidated basis now over time. And there are several multi-year programs that will be coming up for renegotiation in the next year or two. And I believe as we continue to negotiate milestone payments, we'll be more cash favorable. So I throw that out there to maybe answer a couple of the questions. On the cost synergy, we believe there's something in the $50 million range easily from eliminating the public company cost and some of the duplicative overhead. You're right. We have no plans to move facilities, but I look at the footprint. We both have offices in D.C. We both have offices in Huntsville. There's some low-hanging fruit there, and we really didn't anticipate or plan at this point any synergies relative to supply chain. So we need to dig into that and of course, take the power of the new enterprise. So I think that that gets us on the - gets to your question, Doug, on cost synergies. And from L3Harris, we overachieved. And once we get into details, there's potential to continue to exceed those numbers from the cost synergy. Revenue synergy, given that these are new markets, and there's no overlap, we have no revenue synergies at this point in time. So that, I think, is a straightforward answer. I guess on the operations, it's clearly \u2013 I think we have great opportunities here to bring our skill set and enhance our \u2013 the performance of Aerojet Rocketdyne. And I look at what we did at L3Harris before the merger, look at the TR3 program as an example, and maybe our Waco facility. Both those locations are \u2013 the TR3 program was over budget in late. Waco facility was losing money. And with the scale of the new company, more talent, processes, policies, controls, the ability to attract new people, we were able to turn not only that program, but that business around. And I think those are the capabilities that we'll be able to bring to Aerojet Rocketdyne. Relative to pre-closing exposure, I don't think there's anything unique in this relative to other acquisitions. The integration team meets on a regular basis. I would think it's next week or the week after, we'll start having people on-site at some of these facilities as part of the integration process. As you would expect, Eileen Drake and I meet on a regular basis. So we, in fact, had a call yesterday and we have one every week and sometimes more. So I think that's how we're going to stay in touch, and we can do whatever we can to help them. I'm optimistic that this is going to be a very accretive and successful acquisition. We're excited. The employees are excited, and I apologize for the long answer, but I wanted to try to hit all five or six of your questions, Doug. Good morning. All right. Well, thank you. Well, first of all, it's consistent with our strategy. I think I've been talking for several years. We're building a new company to provide more competition within the industry and to give the DoD alternatives. So, I've been pretty consistent in saying we want to grow organically and inorganically. Different companies have different portfolios. And when I looked at the market and the team looked at the markets and we saw the focus and growth on munitions, it seemed to be a gap. So, we think over the long-term to mid-term, you're going to look back on this and see why this thing makes so much sense. I tried to lay out for Doug some of the strategy and some of the trends. But this company has some awesome employees and great technologies, and a great legacy and I think there's going to be continued growth in munitions and space and hypersonics for the long-term. Relative to capital deployment, yes, so that -- it was a -- I don't want to say it was a pretty easy decision, but it was consistent with what we wanted to do. There aren't that many assets available in this industry. And when they come to -- come available, you got to make a decision and act on them. And I'm excited that we got TDL done in 92 days and the integration is already underway. So, we can focus on getting Aerojet Rocketdyne approved and then start the integration. If you look at the investor letter, I think it's page 14, has a nice pie chart that kind of lays out our capital deployment over a five-year period and it shows us a fair amount of balance. But I don't foresee us doing any acquisitions for a couple of years, as you would imagine. We have some non-core assets that we're going to sell, and we're going to use those proceeds to bring down the debt over the next few years. We'll keep annual dividend increases and remain competitive, as you would imagine. And then we'll repurchase shares probably at least $500 million a year to absorb any dilution and depending on cash flow and other dynamics, that number could increase as we go forward. So, Rob, I think, hopefully, that answered your question. Yes. Good morning, Sheila. And yes, IRAD is something that we have been investing in year-over-year. We have industry-leading IRAD kind of in the 3.5% range. We've significantly increased what we call ERAD, our external R&D from customers. When I look at the two together, we're well over $2 billion. So we have a pretty good process to -- a very good process to prioritize how we spend that money. So I think through some of the exciting things, if I start in space, we're excited about the investments that we've made in some new optics that we'd refer to as replicated composite optics. Basically, this is a replacement for glass mirrors in telescopes made out of carbon graphite. So the exciting thing is it's about half the weight. It takes about two-thirds of the time to manufacture, and it's significantly less expensive. And we're going to be launching the first ever replicated optics in the middle of the year. So I think this is going to reduce risk. We'll see how it performs, but this could be a game changer for a satellite business. And the air and land domains with ViaSat, we're investing in the advanced Tactical Data Link with a lot more resiliency. So that's part of the whole strategy there to modernize Link 16. And I think we have the largest library of waveform. So we're very excited about that. And then, maybe on the maritime front, I'm pretty excited that our -- we've talked about our Iver vehicle in the past. This is our autonomous undersea vehicle, just recently has achieved the first ever repetitive submerged launch and recovery from a torpedo tube. This is a significant step for our company, and I think it gives us an opportunity to considerably enhance the nation's autonomous undersea capabilities. So trying to give you some tangible examples and each of those will result in new business programs of record and maybe give you some insight to what's coming out of all the money that we're spending, whether it's IRAD or ERAD. As you probably saw in the letter in other release, we have two new segment presidents join us this year, and I can speak for them and say as they went through our portfolio and looked at the IRAD and some of the things we're working on, both John and Sam were pretty excited about the potential. So thank you, Sheila. Yeah. Thank you, Michael. We do have confidence in margin expansion. I think when you look at the customer, or you look at the portfolio mix they have, it's like everybody in the industry, it's a combination of cost plus and fixed price. So I'm not sure it would all go back to the customer. It should obviously -- they should be able to keep it on the fixed price. But that's in the past. I'm looking going forward. Like any of these acquisitions, there are systems that are fragmented or maybe older technology just like when we put L3 and Harris together. Our IT organization knows how to convert these. I used my reference to ViaSat, the fact that those employees are already on our systems, and it hasn't even been a month. So most of the challenges, challenged program, and I know they've talked about it at length, seems to be at one facility. Like I said, we'll have people down there in the next week or two. And everything has been contemplated in our business case. One of the benefits of being a large -- part of a larger organization, again, this is an acquisition, not a merger, I just like to make a -- an important distinction. We are buying them. They're about one-tenth of our market cap, and this will be a quick integration relative to decisions that need to be made, and a lot of their systems will migrate on to ours, whether it's benefits, payroll, et cetera. On the ERP manufacturing execution systems, they've been putting those in. We're familiar with those systems, familiar with those systems, familiar with the technology. And all that has been contemplated. With our scale, we have the capital. We have the IRAD. We prioritize it, and we have the ability to invest as they have been doing to make them world class. Good morning. No. Absolutely, Seth. Yeah. I mean, Sam joined us at the beginning of the year. When I look \u2013 I know a few people were asking questions relative to Sam and the business. I mean, CS is a short-cycle business with a global footprint, a lot of Army and Marine business. And when I hired Sam, like I do everyone, I look first and foremost for someone who's a leader versus a manager. And everywhere he's been, he's had success strategically, operationally and financially. Whether it's Collins, Sikorsky, UTC, he's led production. He's led programs. He's familiar with foreign military sales, direct commercial sales and a lot of experience globally. So I have no doubt he's going to be very successful and add value to the corporation. When I look at the medium term on comms, I don't want to underestimate the significance of the ViaSat acquisition and the focus on \u2013 on JADC2 and the ability to connect the networks, which the customer has been talking about, it seems like, for a decade. And I'm sure there's frustration on their part that we haven't, as an industry, been able to \u2013 to get that across the goal line. So when I look at the tactical radio business, we continue to see growth in the low to mid-single digits, not only here domestically where the modernization is going to continue. Internationally, in the fourth quarter, we got another contract from Australia that has been a great customer of ours. So the visibility we see continues to look good as the modernization continues the need for resiliency continues. And then I still think there is ability for the \u2013 more of a soldier as a system that's been talked about, but never quite brought across the goal line. So we have the ENVG goggles. We have the radios. There's connectivity that can happen at the soldier level and also networks at a higher level. So it's a key part of our business. And I think anything, as I've said before, over the past year, you look at the war in Ukraine, the ability to communicate is critical to execute the fight of the future. And our resiliency and our capability is unique, and I think it's going to continue to grow for the foreseeable future. Good morning. Okay. Let me take the first part. I'll ask Michelle to talk about the supply chain. As part of our E3 continuous improvement initiative, I'd say we're never ever complete. We talked about a three-year plan to take out $500 million. We took out $660 million. We're going to stop trying to call out separately the one-time costs and the savings as we move into the next cycle of acquisitions. But I can assure it's an ongoing journey. I think we got the low-hanging fruit. We made a lot of progress. So, I'd say maybe we're two-thirds of the way through the integration. And when I look at the IT systems, the ERP systems have come down substantially. I think we used to say there were about 100. By the end of the year, we'll be in the 20s. So, that's good progress. We've got consistent manufacturing execution systems that we're implementing. The one in Greenville should be done this year. We have a couple in other facilities, done a good job on all the shared services. So, in that case, that would be done. The facility moves have been done. But the team is looking at each and every function and process and continuing to optimize it. So, like I said, we did the easy stuff and now we're going function-by-function, relooking at the policies, the procedures, the systems and continuing to look at ways to optimize the business, which will make us faster and ultimately take cash out. So, I'll go with two-thirds of the way through. I'll lateral to Michelle, see if she agrees with me and then have her give some supply chain insight. And I'll just chime in that, if you recall, last time we talked about the importance of our workforce, keeping them engaged and motivated and focusing on some of the attrition. And recall, in October, we talked about some of the things we're doing that are unique. Michelle mentioned the increased merit. We also held all the benefit costs flat from an employee perspective. We've increased the budget for spot awards to recognize performance and some of the other initiatives. And that was a headwind and investments of over $100 million that we're absorbing in 2023 and that provides a little bit of a drag, but it was the right thing to do, and I'm confident it's going to pay off. Yes. Great question and good morning, Kristine. Yes, I said we closed it in 92 days. We have been forecasting mid-year. We made all the appropriate filings for HSR. We responded to all the questions within the 30-day period, for ViaSat that is. There are some international approvals. And I think when you just looked at it, it made a lot of sense, and we weren't sure how that process was going to play out. Relative to Aerojet Rocketdyne, mid-January, we made our HSR filing. We all know the FTC is reviewing it. We've been very responsive in answering their questions, and we'll see how that process works out. We're -- Eileen and I met with key customers jointly in the Pentagon to explain the rationale and answer their questions. So, I think it's just being transparent, being responsive and getting the data request in, in a timely manner, so the process can work. So we'll see how it plays out. But so far, everything is tracking. Yes. Thanks, Peter. Now look, we've talked about Link 16 being on 20,000 platforms. And that really gives us the ability to upgrade and modernize. So when I mentioned the IRAD we're spending on the advanced data tactical link, that's an obvious fit. One of the things we focused on in the negotiation, this was a carve-out. So that's a little unique as to what we buy, what we don't buy. And we really wanted to get access to a relatively small piece of the business, which was the Link 16 to space and Link 16 and Viasat's on the SDA transport. Later this year will be a launch. We will have the first-ever Link 16 capability in space. And I think, again, that's kind of the hidden jewel in this thing. There's going to be Link 16 in space. The connectivity from space to air is a game changer to focus on resiliency. So relative to revenue synergies, we're very excited about the potential here with ViaSat. So the upgrade is going to happen. We're investing in new products. We also have the existing product production that's going well. So I think we're going to look back on this one. It's going to look pretty successful and pretty straightforward and off to a good start. So hopefully, that helps. Good morning. Yeah. Thanks, Rich. On the first one, we have not received any compensation for inflation on fixed price contracts nor have we asked for any. Similar to COVID expenses and others, we just absorbed it as part of the business. I just kind of feel like we survived the - these three years, and everything is looking much better on the upside. Obviously, if we got money, that would be upside. But as of now, we're just moving forward and focused on the new contracts. If something changes or if the DoD encourages us to bring forward a claim of some sort, we'll do it. But there have to be clear documentation. It's not as easy as you would think to prove that. On the deficit reduction, it's something we're all watching. I referenced in the letter. And we're excited to actually have a defense budget to start our fiscal year. So a shout-out to everybody in the lame-duck section \u2013 the lame-duck session for getting that done. And it's a big deal for us and a big deal for the industry and probably even a bigger deal for the Department of Defense. So I think that's the type of thing that gives us confidence in the future. I mean, one thing is for certain. It's really hard to predict how that's going to kind of play out. I'm really not in the camp that thinks DoD is going to be the bill payer. I know, there's some rhetoric around that. People say things to get different leadership positions in Congress. But when you look at the threats out there, it's just hard to justify flattening or reducing the defense budget, and it's a dangerous world. And that comes back to these acquisitions and looking what's going to matter at the end of the day and what the future fight is. And it's situational awareness with ISR, it's resilient comms, and it's munitions. So I like where we are relative to those positions, Rich. So I think with that, we'll wrap up. So I appreciate everybody calling in. I'm a big believer in momentum, and I feel like we have the beginning of some momentum with two consecutive quarters of growth, some acquisitions. I don't know if you can hear it in my voice and Michelle's, but we're really excited about the future and what the potential brings. And I know the initial feedback from the ViaSat employees has been all positive and the Aerojet Rocketdyne employees. And we've actually heard from many of the former Aerojet Rocketdyne employees who are also excited about the transaction. So, we're going to focus on the closing, get this deal done. And once it's closed, we're looking forward to connecting with any former Aerojet Rocketdyne employees and welcome them back if they're passionate about the mission. So, I think it's going to be an exciting couple of years. But before I sign off, I wanted to recognize and thank Dana Mehnert for his 38 years of service. As you know, Dana announced his retirement in Q4 and is assisting with a smooth transition. So, we appreciate that, Dana and wish him all the best in his future endeavors. And I want to turn it over to Michelle real quick."

            "content": "Good morning. Good morning. Yes. No, I appreciate the question, Scott, and thanks for this, because it is important to note that, as we think about our guide for this year, we did take a different approach on a couple of things. Our ISR missionization business is one of them. So to directly answer your question, no, there are not any large international ISR pursuits in the plan. We do have one domestic pursuit, which we're anticipating in the first half of the year. We already have the aircraft. So that's minimizing the risk, and it's funded from a budgetary perspective. It's our C3D program. So we have four aircraft tied around that. And I think this is important, because as we walk through the guide that, this, along with supply chain, were the two key components when we think about how 2022 played out that's really influencing how we're thinking about our guide for 2023. And so I'll just hit supply chain upfront, because I'm assuming we're going to get the question. I'd be disappointed if we didn't get the question. But when we look at our guide for the current year, what we're assuming is something consistent with what we did in the second half of 2022. Coming off of the strong Q4 results, we're incredibly proud of all the teams across our product based businesses in particular. So I want to do a shout-out to our Tactical Communications team, WESCAM, PSPC, along with commercial aviation. We had a really strong finish to the year. And as we're building on that momentum coming into 2023, we're assuming that we're having consistent results in the second half of 2022 throughout the full year of the 2023 guide. And so to your point, Scott, around using what we learned in 2022 and influencing our 2023 outlook, there's really two key components. One was around the ISR missionization demand. And although we're continuing to pursue a handful of those programs with budgets being up, we're optimistic that we're going to be able to land a contract. We thought it was prudent at this point to not put that into our guide and it would be upside. Good morning. I always agree with you, Chris. But just to add a little bit more color, I think a great example of where we're continuing on this next phase is around our real estate and our footprint consolidation efforts. And so to Chris' point, we took the low-hanging fruit in the first couple of years. Byron Green and his real estate team have really been focused on what's the next phase of that. We're in the middle of a two-year plan to take out an additional 10% as a result -- 10% of our overall sites as a result of this current operating environment where we have more of a hybrid workforce. So, it's continuing to be an evolution that's going to continue to pay dividends for. It's really helping to offset some of the macro inflationary challenges that are permeating across the industry. And then just to give a little bit more color from a supply chain perspective, I talked about our 2023 guide. And the word I would use is -- to describe it as a balanced approach. Again, the guide assumes it's consistent with our second half 2022 performance. But just to make this a little bit more tangible, I think it's helpful to think about what's different as we think about 2023 versus what remains the same at the start of, say, 2022 or at the end of 2021. So, I'll illuminate a few things for you because I think it helps bound the risk as you think about our guidance. Frankly, it's how we're managing the business internally. So, what's the same? What's the same is we do continue to see hiccups from an overall supply chain ecosystem perspective. This is consistent across our industry and other industries. This is something that's become a bit of the new norm. What's also consistent is we do continue to be on a 90-day allocation process with our microelectronic chip manufacturers. And this is a really important point because even when we continue to see the improvements like we did within Q4, the reality is the insights that we're getting to our supply from a chip perspective is good for about 90 days out. Then it gets more nebulous as we get into the latter part of the year. And then finally, I know we've put some of this within our Q3 earnings call. But just a reminder, 25% of our portfolio, which is different than our peers, is tied to in product deliveries. But if we're short on chips or we're short on washers or nuts, we're not going to be able to deliver that radio or that turret. And so those things remain the same as you think about our 2023 guide. Now what is different, right? And we've been talking about a lot of this in 2022, but what's really different is those proactive actions that we took last year to be purposeful and focusing on the things we can control. They help to minimize the risk in 2023. And so just a reminder, engineering redesigns were a big focus for 2022. We get the full value of that benefit in 2023. Our alternate part bank within our Tactical Communications Systems business is up to 1,000 parts. That would have been at 100 parts in 2021. Our overall revenue base in terms of DPAS coverage, it's also increased double digits. So that aids in the prioritization of our supply and material availability. And then finally, I think this is the most important predictive indicator is the number of critical parts. When we started and we felt the most acute impact from supply chain was really in the second half of 2021. We had hundreds of critical part shortages at that time. Fast forward to where we are today, and we're in the 10s in terms of the impact and what we're having to manage through. So the way I would characterize this is we continue to see sequential improvement from a supply chain perspective. We're not out of the woods by any means. And so as a result, we're taking a balanced approach to 2023, and that's what's reflected in our guide. Yeah. No, great questions. So let me walk through from a margin perspective. I'll start from the overall enterprise, right? To your point, Rob, we are assuming flattish margins, 15.4, 15.5-ish. From a headwind perspective, we are assuming continued macro inflationary challenges of about $400 million, so about 2.5% of our overall revenue. And we also have some headwinds from a mix perspective. Chris talked about where we're investing in space. Kelly and her team are doing phenomenal in terms of growing the business. At the same time, however, that will be a drag on our margins. As these new programs come on board, we typically book them at lower rates. And as we mitigate the risk, we start to see the profitability in those programs improve. So from a headwinds perspective, inflationary, challenges and mix, that is being offset by our continued strong E3 savings program, as Chris alluded to earlier. Real estate is a great example of that. Another great example is the voluntary retirement program that we announced at the end of Q3 last year. That's going to help to pay dividends and offset the merit increases that we're planning for from a human capital perspective. And then we've also assumed some level of commercial pricing. To your point, specifically, Rob, like what is the downside? The downside, from my perspective is this continuation of the unknown unknowns from an inflationary challenge perspective, right? There was a lot that permeated within 2022 that it felt like it was more of a reactionary year. And so, as a result, we're doing everything that we can to control the controllables. And we will prudently manage through that as we make our way through 2023."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2022 earnings call. We published our investor letter after the market closed yesterday Today's call will primarily be focused on answering your questions. Joining me for the call are Chris Kubasik, our CEO; and Michelle Turner, our CFO. A few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. A few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our investor letter and SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. Before going to questions, Chris will make some brief comments.\nChris Kubasik: In the midst of quarterly results and financial outlooks, we can easily lose sight of the importance of the mission. Delivering the technologies to our war fighters who are never in a fair fight is imperative. Earlier this week, we lost a great American and pioneer in Defense. Dr. Ash Carter fostered collaboration between Silicon Valley, the defense industrial base, and the Pentagon. He successfully changed the way we combat terrorists and he opened combat roles to women. Many of us at L3Harris, including our Board of Directors, either knew or worked for Ash Carter. We all send our deepest condolences to his family and friends. Before jumping into questions, as we normally do, I'd like to make a few comments. By now, you have read our investor letter and much like you've heard from our peers, it's clear that we're operating in a dynamic environment. Starting with the good news. My team's energy and excitement continues to build as our trusted disruptor strategy is yielding tangible results and is well-aligned with the recently released National Defense strategy. We've carved out a leadership position as a non-traditional prime with a record quarter of over $5 billion in funded orders and a book-to-bill of roughly 1.2. These were driven by notable prime position awards related to Armed Overwatch for SOCOM, responsive space with the SDA tracking tranche 1 and network systems for the US Navy. We also announced our first acquisition since the merger. We're acquiring Viasat's Tactical Data Link business and gaining access to the ubiquitous Link 16 network. This product line fits nicely in our comms and networking-centric portfolio, enabling us to bring the DoD's JADC2's effort to life. Our momentum is building, and I'm optimistic about the value-creating opportunities ahead. Conversely, on the not so good news, we rightsized our 2022 guidance based on current realities. We previously highlighted a steep ramp in the back half of the year. And while we're making progress, today's backdrop necessitates a more measured approach. Let's start with the top line. We grew for the first time in four quarters at 3%, though fell short of our mid-single-digit expectations. This is because of two primary factors. First, we were previously selected for a Mideast aircraft missionization program that included a profitable sale to a key customer, but the formal signing of the contract has now been pushed out as the shifting geopolitical landscape continues to hamper the timing of certain international awards. This would have supported two points of growth for the full year, alongside profits and cash. Second, supply chain headwinds continue, and although improved, the recovery was not aligned with our expectations. As a reminder, with our commercial business model, 25% of our revenue is tied to end unit deliveries. We need 100% of the parts to assemble our products, such as a radio in order to make deliveries and recognize revenue. Thus, we are taking a more prudent approach in the fourth quarter as the availability of mainly electronic components remain volatile. So our expectations is for a 2% decline in 2022 versus the roughly 1% growth we pointed to previously. We ultimately view these as deferrals versus lost sales. Next, on segment margins. The approximately 16% in our previous guide is going to be closer to 15.5% and in the range of our year-to-date average. This is a result of net higher inflationary input costs offset by proactive cost actions focused on controlling what we can. As expected, the reduced revenue and margins are driving the guidance decline in EPS and free cash flow. On 2023, I know there's a lot of focus here, and we'll properly guide with year-end results as we typically do in January. That being said, our expectation is for improving revenues and relatively steady margins, while growing free cash flow and free cash flow per share year-over-year. This remains a work in process for the next couple of months. So a tough, but necessary financial update. We remain focused on executing our strategy of being a trusted disruptor and controlling the controllables in today's dynamic environment. With that, Rob, let's open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thanks so much. Good morning, guys and Chris, thanks so much for your letter and kind words on Secretary Carter. I think, there's no doubt that you're not only a trusted disruptor, but you add a human element to everything that you do, whether it's talking to the DoD or the investor community, and you picked a partner in Michelle that does the same. So just wanted to mention that. But in terms of my question, in the letter, you talked about analyzing the situation over the next few months prior to providing 2023 guidance. So, how do you think about maybe the pinch points, whether it's on sales or margins and how you're thinking about the range of outcomes?\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Well, Sheila, first of all, thanks for the kind comments. The whole team here is highly motivated to support the war fighter and our customers, as you know. Why don't I focus on the sales or revenue piece, and then I'll ask Michelle to talk about the margins as we planned for 2023? I noted the book-to-bill strength, and the strategy is working. We're winning a lot of business, including prime, I highlighted Armed Overwatch as an example. And just to show you the speed and agility with which we work, we'll be making our first delivery in 2023 as an example. We had previously won Tranche 0, and we have launches scheduled for March of 2023. We won Tranche 1 for SDA tracking for 14 satellites, and those are obviously doing well and scheduled for launch later in this decade. We haven't talked about HBTSS in a while. That launch is looking good for mid-2023. So while we may not recognize revenue upon launch, I just want to highlight the cadence in the volume and the speed in which we're working. And just looking at the manifest the other day, we have about 40 spacecraft scheduled to be launched in the next 24 months. So that gives you an idea of how we're doing in the space world. We talked historically about some of the airborne headwind, using that as kind of a proxy for F-35, which decreased in 2022 compared to 2021. I think like everybody else on the program, we're kind of seeing a leveling off. So we will not have that headwind. It won't provide a tailwind, but nonetheless, it will flatten out. So the supply chain is really the focus, and it is quite volatile. I can assure you, relative to that, I may give more detail on a subsequent question if I get one. But booked CS grew 4% for the quarter. TACOM was double digit. Of course, that was to a pretty easy compare a year ago. So we're going to just look at the progress we're making as of November and December, and that run rate will give us insight. I think we all tend to talk about supply chain as a homogeneous entity. But, as you know, it's much more fragmented. We see improvements in shipping and components and chemicals, but there's still a lot of turmoil, as you would expect with electronic components. So we'll take the last available data and then give guidance that we have confidence we'll be able to achieve for 2023. Michelle?\nMichelle Turner: Yes. And I'll just add before jumping into the margins. When we look at our overall portfolio, just a reminder for those on the call, 25% is recognized in terms of revenue based on delivery. So that's a little bit different than others within the industry. So as you think about some of the supply chain constraints and the deferrals associated with it, it really is the entirety of the revenue being recognized versus over like a cost incurred type of revenue recognition. Also, this is our higher-margin business. It runs about 25% for us. So again, to Chris' point, this is more reflective of deferred revenue versus lost. But just to give a little bit more color in terms of margins, how it's playing out in 2022 and how we're thinking about 2023, to Chris' opening comments, we did reduce our guide to 15.5 from an overall segment perspective, really driven by two things. One was around the volume mix, in terms operating aircraft missionization along with the supply chain constraints, these tend to be margin accretive for us across our own portfolio. But also just in recognition of the overall macro operating environment, you're hearing this consistent with our peers. Higher input costs, whether it be supply chain, labor, inflation, along with things like redesigning parts internally to ensure we can continue to meet our customers' critical missions, all of that is equating to about a $250 million incremental cost headwind for us in 2022, of which we are doing what we can to control the controllables, and we've been able to successfully offset about 70% of that increased cost across the overall ecosystem. So, as we think about 2023, we're taking all of these data points into effect, along with where do we land at the end of the year from a supply chain perspective. Given that 40% of our overall portfolio is short cycle in nature, that data point is going to be very relevant in terms of how do we set guidance, both from a top line and bottom line perspective for next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nMichelle Turner: Good morning.\nRobert Stallard: I'd like to delve into the non-cash charges that you booked this quarter. And what exactly drove the timing of those charges being taken here? And in particular, you mentioned that the demand for precision guidance seems to be weakened, but that would go against the grain given the broader defense environment we're seeing.\nMichelle Turner: Yes. So, I'll take this, and Chris feel free to jump in, in terms of overall demand. But thanks, Rob, for highlighting this. I think it's creating some noise in terms of our overall reporting. So, it's a good opportunity to talk about. This is really a continuation of what we've been amplifying across our portfolio. So, just to put this into perspective, we have $18 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet related to the L3Harris merger. We took a $800 million charge within Q3. It's about 4%, 4.5% of the overall balance. Really targeted at two of our legacy businesses that we've been talking about for a while in terms of being on the low end of our portfolio from a growth perspective. And so as we went through our strategic plan over the last month, along with the updated DoD budgets, and really aligning with what we've been highlighting the areas of focus from a customer perspective to what we're seeing within our overall product portfolio, this is really just a continuation of two of our legacy businesses where we've highlighted risk associated with these businesses as we're investing in areas from a DoD perspective, like space and cyber. Similarly, we have parts of our portfolio that are going to be on the lower end of that growth spectrum. So, not a surprise here. This is consistent with what we've been talking about across the overall portfolio.\nChris Kubasik: And I think, Rob, to the timing question, I think most companies look at this at the end of the year per the requirements for goodwill accounting. But to the extent you become aware of an instance to do a check, you ought to do it. So, when we looked at the rising interest rate environment, and as Michelle said, having just completed our preliminary plan, we went ahead and ran the numbers and took the charge here in Q3. So, that's the timing.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nRichard Safran: Chris, Michelle, Rajeev, good morning.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning.\nRichard Safran: Chris, I appreciate and I really like the commentary in your letter. But I was really surprised to see you categorize defense budget environment under ugly. So, I have two things I want to ask you here. First, nobody thinks that CR is good, but they're generally short-term. Do you think -- or is your thinking that the CR could go past December? And more importantly is if we just exclude the CR for a moment, given the bipartisan support for defense, do you hold a positive view of defense spending and see continued year-over-year increases above inflation and especially as it pertains to L3Harris programs?\nChris Kubasik: Yeah, Rich. Rich, thanks for that. We did lay out the good, the bad, the ugly. Clearly, the war is ugly. So there's no dispute in that regard. And for those of us that run a business, we like to have things done on time and on an annual basis. And to be honest, the CRs are getting old. I think this is the 15th CR in 20 years. So it almost becomes the norm. But I still hold out hope that we can have a budget in a timely manner. So to your point, specifically, on the CR, we do have an election upcoming as we know, in November. So we'll see how that plays out. And I'm hopeful that we have a budget and the conference occurs in December. But when you look at the total debt that's accumulating in our country, you look at the debt ceilings, many of us were around and remember sequestration and Budget Control Act, and all those things that are looming out there does give me concern. The PBR was $773 billion. And we have the different markups from 777 to 819, and a couple of things in between. So there has to be a conference. There has to be a process and \u2013 until it's signed, it's hard to run the business. And I think, when I talk to my industry peers, we all agree. We prefer to have a budget approved. And I think, there is some potential that this thing could get extended past December, and put the same pressures on our business that we experienced this year. So on the upside, when I look at all of our customers internationally, we're seeing budget increases aligned with the threats. So there is some good news there. The overall budget environment is growing. We just need to get it. When I'm in the Pentagon in D.C., trust me, the customers have the same feeling. They probably hate a CR more than I do. So I decided to call it ugly, until we have a budget.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Harned: Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to go back to the supply chain and communication systems. This has been \u2013 you also highlighted this as an issue for some time. And what I'm trying to understand here is, at one point, it was about semiconductors and then it appeared to expand a little bit into some other components. And I guess, what I'm trying to understand is how you \u2013 how confident you are \u2013 you're on top of this now that \u2013 are you seeing basically the same components as a problem? Has this expanded more? And then, if I can tag on to that, as you have delays in shipments, you talked about pent-up demand in the letter. Should we be expecting a surge at some point back in terms of deliveries, say, in late 2023 or into 2024?\nChris Kubasik: All right, Doug, thanks. Let me take the first part on supply chain. I'll ask Michelle to comment on the surge. And it's a great question. And I'll say, I think we have control over the situation, but let me explain the complexities as we were reviewing this a week or so ago. And I'll just use TCOM as an example. So in the quarter, we delivered about 12,000 radios. And you've heard me say and Michelle say, and we'll probably continue to say, we don't book the revenue, the profit until we make the delivery. So they were split between manpack radios call it, 8,000 manpacks and 4,000 handheld radios. And when you go down into the details, and we looked at the schematics, talk to the team, I think Michelle was just up there a few weeks ago at a KIA event on supply chain that we hosted. There's about 10,000 parts in a manpack; 5,000 in a handheld. I'll do the math for you. The bottom line is we needed 100 million parts to deliver those 12,000 radios. So we monitor this on a daily basis. I would say we get 97.5% of the parts in. But I said in my prepared comments, if you don't have all the parts, you can't deliver a radio. You can deliver an airplane with missing parts. You can deliver a ship with missing parts, and you deliver a lot of things with missing parts, but you can't deliver a radio or arguably night vision goggles or cameras. So I think that's what's unique. And the question got to be, do we know what the heck we're doing here, which this is a fair question, you didn't ask that, but I'm sure that's on people's minds. So we looked at a key supplier as an example, where we ordered 18 months ago, 25,000 parts. We have a commitment. We pay the cash, all the good stuff you would expect. But the mid-September delivery, which would have allowed us to ramp up and maybe get closer to our prior guidance, only 5,000 parts arrived because there's an allocation process. So these commitments and all of us, me personally talking to CEOs of major corporations, you get the commitment that passes through the system, and they get an allocation and we come up short. So this happens on a regular basis. We're leveraging DPAS. Like I said, we have executive outreach. We have contacts. We look at this daily. But that's an example of maybe it's down in the weeds, but that's what we're tracking, 100 million parts for one entity for one quarter, and that's how we came up where we are. And that's why, to Sheila's question, we'll look and see how November and December, we do track I'll just stick with radios, but I can go through all the entities if you want. We have about 400 key suppliers. We had 30 that were on the watch list back in Q1. We're down to 10 that are on the watch list, meaning either poor quality or cutting the allocation. So that's where we are. And that's why I can say, we're making progress, but you almost have to be perfect in that regard. So I don't know, Michelle, if you want to supplement what I said or talk about the surge.\nMichelle Turner: Yeah. So a couple of things I would highlight. I think on the positives, right, we continue to see sequential improvement quarter-on-quarter. So even with the guidance change, I think it's important to note that we assumed a significant ramp-up within the second half. So although we're disappointed that we're not getting to the ramp that we originally had anticipated, we are seeing improvement from where we started having this acute pain point in Q3 of last year versus where we're at today. The other thing I would highlight is we continue to see really strong demand across communication systems, particularly within our TCOM business. Chris noted the record $5 billion bookings that we had within the quarter that was led from Tactical Communications. And then if you look at our backlog, it continues to grow. We started the year at $1.3 billion. We're ending Q3 at $1.9 billion. So going into next year, we're certainly going to have a strong tailwind in terms of demand for the product. To Chris' point, however, this is going to be muted a bit by this headwind from a supply chain perspective. We do anticipate that it will continue to be volatile through the end of next year. And our challenge is getting our arms around expectations for 2023 with the recognition that we continue to see volatility even within a quarter, particularly within our short-cycle businesses like communication systems. One thing I do just want to highlight because I want to give huge -- Chris noted that I was up in Rochester at an AIA event a few weeks ago. I want to give props to the Rochester TCOM team. We talk a lot about the supply chain volatility and our ability to react. And again, we're disappointed with the results but just gaining an appreciation for what it takes to actually deliver on what we did deliver on in terms of that double-digit growth within the quarter. But what we don't talk a lot about is the demand volatility that goes along with that. And so the team received an urgent request order for Ukraine At the end of Q3, we were able to book and turn that within a matter of seven days. And so it just speaks to the agility from internally within the company. But it also speaks to how we're rising to the challenge from a mission perspective, ensuring -- even with all of these things that continue to disrupt and create volatility within our ecosystem, we're continuing to put the mission of our customers first.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Deuschle: Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question.\nMichelle Turner: Good morning.\nScott Deuschle: Chris, this quarter reminds me of the old L3, to be honest, which was always pretty unpredictable and prone to surprises. I had thought with the switch to an operating company type approach that this would perhaps be less prone to happening since you'd have better visibility into the business. So maybe just help us understand why the switch to the operating company approach hasn't driven better predictability or would you just say that it has helped and it's just that the environment is simply too unpredictable? Thank you.\nChris Kubasik: Scott, thanks for the question. And what I like about your question is it kind of aligns with the culture that we're trying to build here at L3Harris. And that is just encouraging people to speak up and ask the tough questions. And I appreciate you asking it actually because, as you can imagine, I kind of had a similar thought across my mind having taken over L3 back in 2018. So this was the whole basis -- one of the key basis of the merger is how do we accelerate that transition from holding companies, which really doesn't work in this industry for a variety of reasons to an operating model. So I think it has helped. I think if we go back and look, it's probably been at least 12 months for certain, and clearly, the last six months that Michelle and I in public forums and other venues have been pretty outspoken about the risks. I think it was in the second quarter, we talked -- I mean I go back to January, right? And we were very transparent in my opinion. And we said, look, we're going to shrink in the first half and then we're going to go up the steep slope in the second half. And as you would expect, we were -- honored our word and we shrunk in the first half. I wasn't happy about it, but that was the plan, and we executed accordingly. And we really needed to have a good ramp here in Q3. And we laid out there were three main components that were going to drive it. One occurred, which is just our normal focus on delivering quality products on time. We had an assumption on supply chain, which I think I've given enough examples on the 100 million parts and that one supplier as an example that came up short. And then this Mid-East International missionized aircraft which was just a matter of getting the contracts signed. So it was probably the 20th of September with 10 days to go where we figured this contract is going to be signed. And you get down to the 29th, and it's not signed, its 2 points of revenue for the whole year. So I would say, we have very good visibility. I, personally, along with Michelle, participate in monthly financial reviews. I don't think there's a lot of companies who have their CEOs involved in a monthly review at the level and size of our company. So we have good visibility. We track the risks. We mitigate them where we can. Opportunities pop up like Ukraine. We capitalize on those. And we're trying to be transparent and measured and prudent in telling you what's happening. So, I think, that was a great question, and hopefully, that addressed it.\nMichelle Turner: Yes. The only thing I would add to it, Scott, just going back to our previous example, and I think what you're seeing within our portfolio that's different than maybe others within the industry is this revenue recognition for 25% of our portfolio being on delivery, right? And so, you could be missing a part in a program-based scenario, but you're still going to recognize the revenue. Here, if we don't have every part, we're not going to recognize that. And to Chris' point, when you think about a radio, we can book and turn those pretty quickly within a week. And so, I think, you get the combination of the fact that we take revenue based on delivery, coupled with the short cycle nature, there can be and there has been and there will continue to be volatility within the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please, proceed with your question.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning, David.\nDavid Strauss: Chris, I just want to see, as we think about next year, does adjusted EPS grow, given, I think, you're going to have a pretty meaningful pension headwind? And then, I think you said that free cash flow is going to grow. But if you can give us some of the mechanics there, because I think you're also going to have a pension cash headwind as well. Thanks.\nChris Kubasik: Yes. Thanks, David. Yes, there\u2019s got to be -- the free cash flow, we have the tax cap -- the R&D capitalization. That's still something we're watching assuming that there's no fix to that issue. The impact of that will be about $150 million less. So if we can grow the top line, we'll keep the margin steady. We should have a little more cash from operations plus the $150 million from taxes. So that gives me confidence in free cash flow growth and free cash flow per share growth. The current outlook just on the pensions is on cash at zero. We're going to be funded in the mid to high 90s. So there is no cash draw on pensions. Relative to adjusted EPS, I'll ask Michelle to give you the details on the pension. But, yes, there will be a pension headwind. We'll true up those final assumptions at the end of the year. So we'll give you the impact. And I think, we just got to see where the year ends up and what we give for next year. I think it could be flattish to maybe up or down a couple of points, depending on the final assumptions where we end 2023 -- I'm sorry, where we end 2022 as a takeoff point for 2022. So, Michelle?\nMichelle Turner: Yes. So to Chris' point, just to hit a couple of your questions, David, we don't anticipate having to do any incremental funding from a pension perspective but well-funded. When you think about the income line and EPS, two impacts there, very consistent with what you heard from our industry peers. On the FAS income line, we anticipate that will be about $150 million impact going into 2023. And then from a cash recoverability perspective, consistent with what we've shared historically, we expect that to continue to dwindle over the next few years with it representing about a $50 million impact in 2023. So, in totality, about $200 million.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nGautam Khanna: Hey good morning guys.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning.\nGautam Khanna: I was wondering if you could elaborate on your comments about potentially stable margins next year. Obviously, the CS volatility, you've explained. But on the other two segments, do you think -- like can you maybe describe or quantify the headwinds you see as of now that you're going to need to offset? And maybe just talk about stable relative to what the full annual 2022 levels of margin or kind of the exit rates out of the year? Thanks.\nMichelle Turner: Yes. So, just to give a little bit of color and context, and feel free, Chris, to jump in as well, here is kind of how we're thinking about it. What's going to be key is how we close the year from a Q4 perspective, particularly within tactical communications given the margin impact across all of our product portfolio. Within that, there's also a mix component, right? So, we've seen strong demand internationally. And so these are tailwinds as we think about going into next year. From a headwind perspective, it's really around the macroeconomic environment, right? We're continuing to see higher input costs. I talked about that in terms of 2022 impact. But as we think about going into next year, what does that look like is we're going to -- we're assuming that it's going to continue to be volatile. There's going to continue to be rising costs. And then the actions that we're taking internally to offset that. And I think a great example of this is we announced the voluntary retirement program at the end of Q3. That's going to help us as we think about inflation next year, particularly on the labor side of the equation. And so it's -- how does all of that come together in terms of our guide, which we're triangulating around this relatively flat point based on what we know today.\nChris Kubasik: And Gautam, it's so important to have a talented workforce in order to execute on everything we talk about. So, a lot of our focus of the leadership team has been to keep the workforce engaged and motivated. And I think we can all admit over the last couple of years, we found new ways to do work. The attrition was hard hit for, I think, every company, but it seems this industry in particular, that seems to have stabilized a little bit. But we're spending a lot of time focusing on the workforce, and there will be headwinds in 2023 compared to 2022. We're going to have a larger merit increase pool. We're holding the medical dental vision co-pays flat year-over-year. Everybody is going through open enrollment as we speak, and we're getting great, great feedback on that decision. But these cost money, and it's a decision that I and the leadership team made that we're going to spend more money on the workforce, and that does provide a headwind to the margins, which we're going to try to find a way to absorb. But I'd rather make these investments now, keep the workforce engaged, motivated and focusing on the programs that they support.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Proceed with your question.\nPeter Arment: Yeah. Good morning, Chris, Michelle.\nMichelle Turner: Good morning.\nPeter Arment: Michelle, you mentioned the 40% short-cycle exposure. Maybe you could just update us your thoughts on just your ability to reprice or get pricing in that help offset inflation, how we think that flows through when we're thinking about 2023? And then just, Chris, as an aside, you've given us a lot of details on the supply chain. But just are your thoughts on any further vertical integration to help either redesign or help try to limit some of the disruptions that you've had? Thanks.\nMichelle Turner: Thanks, Peter, for the question. So just a reminder for folks, about 25% of our overall portfolio is what we consider commercial, and we have the ability to reprice in an environment like we're in today. And so teams are doing a good job in terms of as we're reacting to the higher input costs, ensuring that we're getting priced where the market will accept those price increases. As I think about 2023, and I think one of the benefits of our portfolio is that we do -- on our program side of the house, which is about 50% of what we do or 75%, including the cost side piece, it tends to be shorter in nature in terms of period of performance. And so our average period of performance is about 12 to 18 months. And so if you think about this increased inflationary environment starting in the middle of this year, I anticipate that, by the end of next year, we've worked through that backlog that was priced in the pre-inflationary environment. And so I think that's one of the advantages that we have, given our shorter cycle nature, but it also plays into how are we thinking about guidance for next year and going back to -- there's multiple variables that we're taking into consideration, that being one of them.\nChris Kubasik: Yeah. And to your supply chain question, I should have emphasized we're continuing to redesign our existing products, in the old days, I think a lot of companies had a process that focused on design for cost, given the focus on affordability. There are new initiatives that have come about in the years past, we post merger, really focused on design for manufacturing as a way to not have the engineers design something so complicated that we can't actually build it in an efficient manner. And of late, we're rolling out and have been rolling out our design for supply chain. So you now have to consider all those factors when designing a new product, which we're doing and, in our case, redesigning our existing portfolio, if that makes sense. Relative to the vertical integration, if we were suggesting acquisitions, I'm generally against making acquisitions to acquire a sub or a supplier. But it does bring up the point that everything is changing. And I think that's where our company is unique, the ability to adjust. And we keep talking -- we're not going back to the old days. And in the old days, you had a single supplier and now we're going to probably have two or three sources of supply. In the old days, you did just-in-time inventory, and that doesn't work anymore. Lead times, as I mentioned in that one example, are going out 18 months versus 18 days. So the company that can adjust and accept these new realities, which I think we have, will ultimately play off in the long-term. So that's how I look at it. We're still continuing to work with lots of high-tech Silicon Valley and disruptive companies, smaller companies we've talked about through our venture capital and Shield as an example. I think so far, we're up to 10 different investments, minority positions. But again, the key point there is to pool their technology into our portfolio. And I think that's starting to happen, and we're starting to see good receptivity from our customers because these companies can't get programs of record on their own. And I think we're the guys that are out there embracing and encouraging and working with them. And I referenced, I think, early on the National Defense strategy. And there's an interesting part of -- in the NDS that talks about transforming the industrial base. And it really talks about the focus of the prior strategies not incentivizing companies like ours to design open systems that can be incorporated into cutting-edge technologies. And it goes on to say that they're going to reward those companies with rapid experimentation, acquisition and fielding. So it was good to see the NDS come out, because it's consistent with what we've been talking about as a trusted disruptor, and now we just have to operationalize their strategy and our strategy to align. But I like seeing the reference to open systems, and I like seeing the reference to speed, because when you think of L3Harris, you should think of open systems and speed.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Herbert : Yes. Hi. Good morning, Chris and Michelle.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning.\nMichelle Turner: Good morning.\nKen Herbert : If I could just starting off on the Tactical Data Links acquisition. I know obviously, it hasn't closed yet, but Chris, maybe you can provide a little bit more in terms of your thinking strategically how this supports the JADC2 opportunity and maybe how this just supports broader modification and upgrade opportunities? And could we see maybe an acceleration in the top line of that business once it's part of your portfolio? Because obviously, it's a relatively mature technology and a mature set of assets, but I think it could present some interesting opportunities.\nChris Kubasik: Yes, Ken, thank you. I think you probably asked a great question and answered it at the same time. So let me see what I can supplement. I mean, well, first of all, as I've said before, we look at all of our acquisitions, this being the only one so far, strategically, operationally and financially. So strategically, I couldn't have asked for a better first acquisition. This was pretty straightforward and pretty easy, as you suggested. I mean it fits perfectly into our portfolio, fill the gap that we had. It ties into JADC2, networks comms, everything we're known for. And it gives us the footprint on 20,000 plus platforms and real estate matters on these platforms, whether they're aircraft or ships or other platforms. So we'll be able to modernize and upgrade Link 16. We'll be able to work in other way forms and focus on resiliency. So my expectation, I think you said it well, is it's an accelerant not only for their business but for our JADC2 efforts. And on the Tactical side, a little bit, we've been making the regulatory filings. Everything is tracking. We are still projecting a first half of 2023 close. And there has been some positive receptivity. We actually got a couple of calls from customers that we're so excited they wanted to meet. But of course, we have to wait until we close the deal. So we were excited to hear that already. Operationally, I think it will be pretty straight straightforward to integrate this business. And then financially, as I've said, it's accretive. So it also gives us, again, a seat at the table and continues to move us up the food chain. I'll just say on the \u2013 I mentioned this was the only one we did. We are active in the market. We did make a couple of bids on other properties. And I just point out from a financial discipline perspective we were outbid by like 50% or 60%. So we're not going to chase bad deals. We're not going to overpay, and we wish those lock that paid the prices they did. And maybe they were right and we were wrong, but you can't win them all.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nRon Epstein: Yeah. Good morning. Just maybe a question and a follow-up. Forgive me, if you already talked about this a little bit, because I got on the call a little bit late due to a conflict. Anyway, why did you take the charges now? I mean, what was the impetus? And then Chris, I mean, were those legacy L3 businesses or legacy Harris businesses?\nChris Kubasik: Yeah. Well, let me go first, and then I'll throw it to Michelle. Yeah, you have to go back three years to remember this, but it was a merger of equals. And for accounting, one company had to acquire the other based on a variety of a \u2013 variety of rules. And I think the key rule is who had the larger shareholder base. So if my memory is right, I think it was 52-48, 52 Harris; 48 L3. So for accounting, Harris acquired L3. So, all the goodwill went to the L3 properties. Had it flipped, all the goodwill would have gone to the Harris properties. Pretty sure, we would have come up with the same answer regardless. But yeah, all this goodwill is applied to the legacy \u2013 from the acquisition, the legacy L3 businesses, and those were the ones that took the charges. But go ahead, Michelle.\nMichelle Turner: Yeah. And just timing-wise, Ron, to your question, this was as a result of going through our strategic plan process and aligning with the overall DoD priorities. I think it's important to note with these two businesses that, we've been illuminating for a while that they're on the lower end of the portfolio from a growth perspective. So there's no surprises here. It's really just part of the annual assessment, if you will, in looking at where the priorities are from a budget perspective, with our strategic plan and then the recognition that these businesses were already on the bubble to begin with.\nEnd of Q&A:\nChris Kubasik: All right. Well, thanks, Michelle. And thank you, everybody, for joining the call today. I want to thank our 47,000 team members across the globe. It seems like, each year, we continue to get new challenges, and I appreciate your hard work and agility as we move forward. So before signing off, I'd like to acknowledge the progress the team has made on the ESG front, with their dedicated effort over the last few years. And for Sustainalytics, we've become a leader in the global aerospace and defense industry, recently ranking in the top 5%. So our non-traditional strategy is paying off on many levels. I hope everybody has a great weekend. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Kubasik",
            "content": "In the midst of quarterly results and financial outlooks, we can easily lose sight of the importance of the mission. Delivering the technologies to our war fighters who are never in a fair fight is imperative. Earlier this week, we lost a great American and pioneer in Defense. Dr. Ash Carter fostered collaboration between Silicon Valley, the defense industrial base, and the Pentagon. He successfully changed the way we combat terrorists and he opened combat roles to women. Many of us at L3Harris, including our Board of Directors, either knew or worked for Ash Carter. We all send our deepest condolences to his family and friends. Before jumping into questions, as we normally do, I'd like to make a few comments. By now, you have read our investor letter and much like you've heard from our peers, it's clear that we're operating in a dynamic environment. Starting with the good news. My team's energy and excitement continues to build as our trusted disruptor strategy is yielding tangible results and is well-aligned with the recently released National Defense strategy. We've carved out a leadership position as a non-traditional prime with a record quarter of over $5 billion in funded orders and a book-to-bill of roughly 1.2. These were driven by notable prime position awards related to Armed Overwatch for SOCOM, responsive space with the SDA tracking tranche 1 and network systems for the US Navy. We also announced our first acquisition since the merger. We're acquiring Viasat's Tactical Data Link business and gaining access to the ubiquitous Link 16 network. This product line fits nicely in our comms and networking-centric portfolio, enabling us to bring the DoD's JADC2's effort to life. Our momentum is building, and I'm optimistic about the value-creating opportunities ahead. Conversely, on the not so good news, we rightsized our 2022 guidance based on current realities. We previously highlighted a steep ramp in the back half of the year. And while we're making progress, today's backdrop necessitates a more measured approach. Let's start with the top line. We grew for the first time in four quarters at 3%, though fell short of our mid-single-digit expectations. This is because of two primary factors. First, we were previously selected for a Mideast aircraft missionization program that included a profitable sale to a key customer, but the formal signing of the contract has now been pushed out as the shifting geopolitical landscape continues to hamper the timing of certain international awards. This would have supported two points of growth for the full year, alongside profits and cash. Second, supply chain headwinds continue, and although improved, the recovery was not aligned with our expectations. As a reminder, with our commercial business model, 25% of our revenue is tied to end unit deliveries. We need 100% of the parts to assemble our products, such as a radio in order to make deliveries and recognize revenue. Thus, we are taking a more prudent approach in the fourth quarter as the availability of mainly electronic components remain volatile. So our expectations is for a 2% decline in 2022 versus the roughly 1% growth we pointed to previously. We ultimately view these as deferrals versus lost sales. Next, on segment margins. The approximately 16% in our previous guide is going to be closer to 15.5% and in the range of our year-to-date average. This is a result of net higher inflationary input costs offset by proactive cost actions focused on controlling what we can. As expected, the reduced revenue and margins are driving the guidance decline in EPS and free cash flow. On 2023, I know there's a lot of focus here, and we'll properly guide with year-end results as we typically do in January. That being said, our expectation is for improving revenues and relatively steady margins, while growing free cash flow and free cash flow per share year-over-year. This remains a work in process for the next couple of months. So a tough, but necessary financial update. We remain focused on executing our strategy of being a trusted disruptor and controlling the controllables in today's dynamic environment. With that, Rob, let's open up the line for questions. Okay. Well, Sheila, first of all, thanks for the kind comments. The whole team here is highly motivated to support the war fighter and our customers, as you know. Why don't I focus on the sales or revenue piece, and then I'll ask Michelle to talk about the margins as we planned for 2023? I noted the book-to-bill strength, and the strategy is working. We're winning a lot of business, including prime, I highlighted Armed Overwatch as an example. And just to show you the speed and agility with which we work, we'll be making our first delivery in 2023 as an example. We had previously won Tranche 0, and we have launches scheduled for March of 2023. We won Tranche 1 for SDA tracking for 14 satellites, and those are obviously doing well and scheduled for launch later in this decade. We haven't talked about HBTSS in a while. That launch is looking good for mid-2023. So while we may not recognize revenue upon launch, I just want to highlight the cadence in the volume and the speed in which we're working. And just looking at the manifest the other day, we have about 40 spacecraft scheduled to be launched in the next 24 months. So that gives you an idea of how we're doing in the space world. We talked historically about some of the airborne headwind, using that as kind of a proxy for F-35, which decreased in 2022 compared to 2021. I think like everybody else on the program, we're kind of seeing a leveling off. So we will not have that headwind. It won't provide a tailwind, but nonetheless, it will flatten out. So the supply chain is really the focus, and it is quite volatile. I can assure you, relative to that, I may give more detail on a subsequent question if I get one. But booked CS grew 4% for the quarter. TACOM was double digit. Of course, that was to a pretty easy compare a year ago. So we're going to just look at the progress we're making as of November and December, and that run rate will give us insight. I think we all tend to talk about supply chain as a homogeneous entity. But, as you know, it's much more fragmented. We see improvements in shipping and components and chemicals, but there's still a lot of turmoil, as you would expect with electronic components. So we'll take the last available data and then give guidance that we have confidence we'll be able to achieve for 2023. Michelle? And I think, Rob, to the timing question, I think most companies look at this at the end of the year per the requirements for goodwill accounting. But to the extent you become aware of an instance to do a check, you ought to do it. So, when we looked at the rising interest rate environment, and as Michelle said, having just completed our preliminary plan, we went ahead and ran the numbers and took the charge here in Q3. So, that's the timing. Good morning. Yeah, Rich. Rich, thanks for that. We did lay out the good, the bad, the ugly. Clearly, the war is ugly. So there's no dispute in that regard. And for those of us that run a business, we like to have things done on time and on an annual basis. And to be honest, the CRs are getting old. I think this is the 15th CR in 20 years. So it almost becomes the norm. But I still hold out hope that we can have a budget in a timely manner. So to your point, specifically, on the CR, we do have an election upcoming as we know, in November. So we'll see how that plays out. And I'm hopeful that we have a budget and the conference occurs in December. But when you look at the total debt that's accumulating in our country, you look at the debt ceilings, many of us were around and remember sequestration and Budget Control Act, and all those things that are looming out there does give me concern. The PBR was $773 billion. And we have the different markups from 777 to 819, and a couple of things in between. So there has to be a conference. There has to be a process and \u2013 until it's signed, it's hard to run the business. And I think, when I talk to my industry peers, we all agree. We prefer to have a budget approved. And I think, there is some potential that this thing could get extended past December, and put the same pressures on our business that we experienced this year. So on the upside, when I look at all of our customers internationally, we're seeing budget increases aligned with the threats. So there is some good news there. The overall budget environment is growing. We just need to get it. When I'm in the Pentagon in D.C., trust me, the customers have the same feeling. They probably hate a CR more than I do. So I decided to call it ugly, until we have a budget. All right, Doug, thanks. Let me take the first part on supply chain. I'll ask Michelle to comment on the surge. And it's a great question. And I'll say, I think we have control over the situation, but let me explain the complexities as we were reviewing this a week or so ago. And I'll just use TCOM as an example. So in the quarter, we delivered about 12,000 radios. And you've heard me say and Michelle say, and we'll probably continue to say, we don't book the revenue, the profit until we make the delivery. So they were split between manpack radios call it, 8,000 manpacks and 4,000 handheld radios. And when you go down into the details, and we looked at the schematics, talk to the team, I think Michelle was just up there a few weeks ago at a KIA event on supply chain that we hosted. There's about 10,000 parts in a manpack; 5,000 in a handheld. I'll do the math for you. The bottom line is we needed 100 million parts to deliver those 12,000 radios. So we monitor this on a daily basis. I would say we get 97.5% of the parts in. But I said in my prepared comments, if you don't have all the parts, you can't deliver a radio. You can deliver an airplane with missing parts. You can deliver a ship with missing parts, and you deliver a lot of things with missing parts, but you can't deliver a radio or arguably night vision goggles or cameras. So I think that's what's unique. And the question got to be, do we know what the heck we're doing here, which this is a fair question, you didn't ask that, but I'm sure that's on people's minds. So we looked at a key supplier as an example, where we ordered 18 months ago, 25,000 parts. We have a commitment. We pay the cash, all the good stuff you would expect. But the mid-September delivery, which would have allowed us to ramp up and maybe get closer to our prior guidance, only 5,000 parts arrived because there's an allocation process. So these commitments and all of us, me personally talking to CEOs of major corporations, you get the commitment that passes through the system, and they get an allocation and we come up short. So this happens on a regular basis. We're leveraging DPAS. Like I said, we have executive outreach. We have contacts. We look at this daily. But that's an example of maybe it's down in the weeds, but that's what we're tracking, 100 million parts for one entity for one quarter, and that's how we came up where we are. And that's why, to Sheila's question, we'll look and see how November and December, we do track I'll just stick with radios, but I can go through all the entities if you want. We have about 400 key suppliers. We had 30 that were on the watch list back in Q1. We're down to 10 that are on the watch list, meaning either poor quality or cutting the allocation. So that's where we are. And that's why I can say, we're making progress, but you almost have to be perfect in that regard. So I don't know, Michelle, if you want to supplement what I said or talk about the surge. Scott, thanks for the question. And what I like about your question is it kind of aligns with the culture that we're trying to build here at L3Harris. And that is just encouraging people to speak up and ask the tough questions. And I appreciate you asking it actually because, as you can imagine, I kind of had a similar thought across my mind having taken over L3 back in 2018. So this was the whole basis -- one of the key basis of the merger is how do we accelerate that transition from holding companies, which really doesn't work in this industry for a variety of reasons to an operating model. So I think it has helped. I think if we go back and look, it's probably been at least 12 months for certain, and clearly, the last six months that Michelle and I in public forums and other venues have been pretty outspoken about the risks. I think it was in the second quarter, we talked -- I mean I go back to January, right? And we were very transparent in my opinion. And we said, look, we're going to shrink in the first half and then we're going to go up the steep slope in the second half. And as you would expect, we were -- honored our word and we shrunk in the first half. I wasn't happy about it, but that was the plan, and we executed accordingly. And we really needed to have a good ramp here in Q3. And we laid out there were three main components that were going to drive it. One occurred, which is just our normal focus on delivering quality products on time. We had an assumption on supply chain, which I think I've given enough examples on the 100 million parts and that one supplier as an example that came up short. And then this Mid-East International missionized aircraft which was just a matter of getting the contracts signed. So it was probably the 20th of September with 10 days to go where we figured this contract is going to be signed. And you get down to the 29th, and it's not signed, its 2 points of revenue for the whole year. So I would say, we have very good visibility. I, personally, along with Michelle, participate in monthly financial reviews. I don't think there's a lot of companies who have their CEOs involved in a monthly review at the level and size of our company. So we have good visibility. We track the risks. We mitigate them where we can. Opportunities pop up like Ukraine. We capitalize on those. And we're trying to be transparent and measured and prudent in telling you what's happening. So, I think, that was a great question, and hopefully, that addressed it. Good morning, David. Yes. Thanks, David. Yes, there's got to be -- the free cash flow, we have the tax cap -- the R&D capitalization. That's still something we're watching assuming that there's no fix to that issue. The impact of that will be about $150 million less. So if we can grow the top line, we'll keep the margin steady. We should have a little more cash from operations plus the $150 million from taxes. So that gives me confidence in free cash flow growth and free cash flow per share growth. The current outlook just on the pensions is on cash at zero. We're going to be funded in the mid to high 90s. So there is no cash draw on pensions. Relative to adjusted EPS, I'll ask Michelle to give you the details on the pension. But, yes, there will be a pension headwind. We'll true up those final assumptions at the end of the year. So we'll give you the impact. And I think, we just got to see where the year ends up and what we give for next year. I think it could be flattish to maybe up or down a couple of points, depending on the final assumptions where we end 2023 -- I'm sorry, where we end 2022 as a takeoff point for 2022. So, Michelle? Good morning. And Gautam, it's so important to have a talented workforce in order to execute on everything we talk about. So, a lot of our focus of the leadership team has been to keep the workforce engaged and motivated. And I think we can all admit over the last couple of years, we found new ways to do work. The attrition was hard hit for, I think, every company, but it seems this industry in particular, that seems to have stabilized a little bit. But we're spending a lot of time focusing on the workforce, and there will be headwinds in 2023 compared to 2022. We're going to have a larger merit increase pool. We're holding the medical dental vision co-pays flat year-over-year. Everybody is going through open enrollment as we speak, and we're getting great, great feedback on that decision. But these cost money, and it's a decision that I and the leadership team made that we're going to spend more money on the workforce, and that does provide a headwind to the margins, which we're going to try to find a way to absorb. But I'd rather make these investments now, keep the workforce engaged, motivated and focusing on the programs that they support. Yeah. And to your supply chain question, I should have emphasized we're continuing to redesign our existing products, in the old days, I think a lot of companies had a process that focused on design for cost, given the focus on affordability. There are new initiatives that have come about in the years past, we post merger, really focused on design for manufacturing as a way to not have the engineers design something so complicated that we can't actually build it in an efficient manner. And of late, we're rolling out and have been rolling out our design for supply chain. So you now have to consider all those factors when designing a new product, which we're doing and, in our case, redesigning our existing portfolio, if that makes sense. Relative to the vertical integration, if we were suggesting acquisitions, I'm generally against making acquisitions to acquire a sub or a supplier. But it does bring up the point that everything is changing. And I think that's where our company is unique, the ability to adjust. And we keep talking -- we're not going back to the old days. And in the old days, you had a single supplier and now we're going to probably have two or three sources of supply. In the old days, you did just-in-time inventory, and that doesn't work anymore. Lead times, as I mentioned in that one example, are going out 18 months versus 18 days. So the company that can adjust and accept these new realities, which I think we have, will ultimately play off in the long-term. So that's how I look at it. We're still continuing to work with lots of high-tech Silicon Valley and disruptive companies, smaller companies we've talked about through our venture capital and Shield as an example. I think so far, we're up to 10 different investments, minority positions. But again, the key point there is to pool their technology into our portfolio. And I think that's starting to happen, and we're starting to see good receptivity from our customers because these companies can't get programs of record on their own. And I think we're the guys that are out there embracing and encouraging and working with them. And I referenced, I think, early on the National Defense strategy. And there's an interesting part of -- in the NDS that talks about transforming the industrial base. And it really talks about the focus of the prior strategies not incentivizing companies like ours to design open systems that can be incorporated into cutting-edge technologies. And it goes on to say that they're going to reward those companies with rapid experimentation, acquisition and fielding. So it was good to see the NDS come out, because it's consistent with what we've been talking about as a trusted disruptor, and now we just have to operationalize their strategy and our strategy to align. But I like seeing the reference to open systems, and I like seeing the reference to speed, because when you think of L3Harris, you should think of open systems and speed. Good morning. Yes, Ken, thank you. I think you probably asked a great question and answered it at the same time. So let me see what I can supplement. I mean, well, first of all, as I've said before, we look at all of our acquisitions, this being the only one so far, strategically, operationally and financially. So strategically, I couldn't have asked for a better first acquisition. This was pretty straightforward and pretty easy, as you suggested. I mean it fits perfectly into our portfolio, fill the gap that we had. It ties into JADC2, networks comms, everything we're known for. And it gives us the footprint on 20,000 plus platforms and real estate matters on these platforms, whether they're aircraft or ships or other platforms. So we'll be able to modernize and upgrade Link 16. We'll be able to work in other way forms and focus on resiliency. So my expectation, I think you said it well, is it's an accelerant not only for their business but for our JADC2 efforts. And on the Tactical side, a little bit, we've been making the regulatory filings. Everything is tracking. We are still projecting a first half of 2023 close. And there has been some positive receptivity. We actually got a couple of calls from customers that we're so excited they wanted to meet. But of course, we have to wait until we close the deal. So we were excited to hear that already. Operationally, I think it will be pretty straight straightforward to integrate this business. And then financially, as I've said, it's accretive. So it also gives us, again, a seat at the table and continues to move us up the food chain. I'll just say on the \u2013 I mentioned this was the only one we did. We are active in the market. We did make a couple of bids on other properties. And I just point out from a financial discipline perspective we were outbid by like 50% or 60%. So we're not going to chase bad deals. We're not going to overpay, and we wish those lock that paid the prices they did. And maybe they were right and we were wrong, but you can't win them all. Yeah. Well, let me go first, and then I'll throw it to Michelle. Yeah, you have to go back three years to remember this, but it was a merger of equals. And for accounting, one company had to acquire the other based on a variety of a \u2013 variety of rules. And I think the key rule is who had the larger shareholder base. So if my memory is right, I think it was 52-48, 52 Harris; 48 L3. So for accounting, Harris acquired L3. So, all the goodwill went to the L3 properties. Had it flipped, all the goodwill would have gone to the Harris properties. Pretty sure, we would have come up with the same answer regardless. But yeah, all this goodwill is applied to the legacy \u2013 from the acquisition, the legacy L3 businesses, and those were the ones that took the charges. But go ahead, Michelle."

            "name": "Michelle Turner",
            "content": "Yes. And I'll just add before jumping into the margins. When we look at our overall portfolio, just a reminder for those on the call, 25% is recognized in terms of revenue based on delivery. So that's a little bit different than others within the industry. So as you think about some of the supply chain constraints and the deferrals associated with it, it really is the entirety of the revenue being recognized versus over like a cost incurred type of revenue recognition. Also, this is our higher-margin business. It runs about 25% for us. So again, to Chris' point, this is more reflective of deferred revenue versus lost. But just to give a little bit more color in terms of margins, how it's playing out in 2022 and how we're thinking about 2023, to Chris' opening comments, we did reduce our guide to 15.5 from an overall segment perspective, really driven by two things. One was around the volume mix, in terms operating aircraft missionization along with the supply chain constraints, these tend to be margin accretive for us across our own portfolio. But also just in recognition of the overall macro operating environment, you're hearing this consistent with our peers. Higher input costs, whether it be supply chain, labor, inflation, along with things like redesigning parts internally to ensure we can continue to meet our customers' critical missions, all of that is equating to about a $250 million incremental cost headwind for us in 2022, of which we are doing what we can to control the controllables, and we've been able to successfully offset about 70% of that increased cost across the overall ecosystem. So, as we think about 2023, we're taking all of these data points into effect, along with where do we land at the end of the year from a supply chain perspective. Given that 40% of our overall portfolio is short cycle in nature, that data point is going to be very relevant in terms of how do we set guidance, both from a top line and bottom line perspective for next year. Good morning. Yes. So, I'll take this, and Chris feel free to jump in, in terms of overall demand. But thanks, Rob, for highlighting this. I think it's creating some noise in terms of our overall reporting. So, it's a good opportunity to talk about. This is really a continuation of what we've been amplifying across our portfolio. So, just to put this into perspective, we have $18 billion of goodwill on our balance sheet related to the L3Harris merger. We took a $800 million charge within Q3. It's about 4%, 4.5% of the overall balance. Really targeted at two of our legacy businesses that we've been talking about for a while in terms of being on the low end of our portfolio from a growth perspective. And so as we went through our strategic plan over the last month, along with the updated DoD budgets, and really aligning with what we've been highlighting the areas of focus from a customer perspective to what we're seeing within our overall product portfolio, this is really just a continuation of two of our legacy businesses where we've highlighted risk associated with these businesses as we're investing in areas from a DoD perspective, like space and cyber. Similarly, we have parts of our portfolio that are going to be on the lower end of that growth spectrum. So, not a surprise here. This is consistent with what we've been talking about across the overall portfolio. Yeah. So a couple of things I would highlight. I think on the positives, right, we continue to see sequential improvement quarter-on-quarter. So even with the guidance change, I think it's important to note that we assumed a significant ramp-up within the second half. So although we're disappointed that we're not getting to the ramp that we originally had anticipated, we are seeing improvement from where we started having this acute pain point in Q3 of last year versus where we're at today. The other thing I would highlight is we continue to see really strong demand across communication systems, particularly within our TCOM business. Chris noted the record $5 billion bookings that we had within the quarter that was led from Tactical Communications. And then if you look at our backlog, it continues to grow. We started the year at $1.3 billion. We're ending Q3 at $1.9 billion. So going into next year, we're certainly going to have a strong tailwind in terms of demand for the product. To Chris' point, however, this is going to be muted a bit by this headwind from a supply chain perspective. We do anticipate that it will continue to be volatile through the end of next year. And our challenge is getting our arms around expectations for 2023 with the recognition that we continue to see volatility even within a quarter, particularly within our short-cycle businesses like communication systems. One thing I do just want to highlight because I want to give huge -- Chris noted that I was up in Rochester at an AIA event a few weeks ago. I want to give props to the Rochester TCOM team. We talk a lot about the supply chain volatility and our ability to react. And again, we're disappointed with the results but just gaining an appreciation for what it takes to actually deliver on what we did deliver on in terms of that double-digit growth within the quarter. But what we don't talk a lot about is the demand volatility that goes along with that. And so the team received an urgent request order for Ukraine At the end of Q3, we were able to book and turn that within a matter of seven days. And so it just speaks to the agility from internally within the company. But it also speaks to how we're rising to the challenge from a mission perspective, ensuring -- even with all of these things that continue to disrupt and create volatility within our ecosystem, we're continuing to put the mission of our customers first. Good morning. Yes. The only thing I would add to it, Scott, just going back to our previous example, and I think what you're seeing within our portfolio that's different than maybe others within the industry is this revenue recognition for 25% of our portfolio being on delivery, right? And so, you could be missing a part in a program-based scenario, but you're still going to recognize the revenue. Here, if we don't have every part, we're not going to recognize that. And to Chris' point, when you think about a radio, we can book and turn those pretty quickly within a week. And so, I think, you get the combination of the fact that we take revenue based on delivery, coupled with the short cycle nature, there can be and there has been and there will continue to be volatility within the quarter. Yes. So to Chris' point, just to hit a couple of your questions, David, we don't anticipate having to do any incremental funding from a pension perspective but well-funded. When you think about the income line and EPS, two impacts there, very consistent with what you heard from our industry peers. On the FAS income line, we anticipate that will be about $150 million impact going into 2023. And then from a cash recoverability perspective, consistent with what we've shared historically, we expect that to continue to dwindle over the next few years with it representing about a $50 million impact in 2023. So, in totality, about $200 million. Yes. So, just to give a little bit of color and context, and feel free, Chris, to jump in as well, here is kind of how we're thinking about it. What's going to be key is how we close the year from a Q4 perspective, particularly within tactical communications given the margin impact across all of our product portfolio. Within that, there's also a mix component, right? So, we've seen strong demand internationally. And so these are tailwinds as we think about going into next year. From a headwind perspective, it's really around the macroeconomic environment, right? We're continuing to see higher input costs. I talked about that in terms of 2022 impact. But as we think about going into next year, what does that look like is we're going to -- we're assuming that it's going to continue to be volatile. There's going to continue to be rising costs. And then the actions that we're taking internally to offset that. And I think a great example of this is we announced the voluntary retirement program at the end of Q3. That's going to help us as we think about inflation next year, particularly on the labor side of the equation. And so it's -- how does all of that come together in terms of our guide, which we're triangulating around this relatively flat point based on what we know today. Good morning. Thanks, Peter, for the question. So just a reminder for folks, about 25% of our overall portfolio is what we consider commercial, and we have the ability to reprice in an environment like we're in today. And so teams are doing a good job in terms of as we're reacting to the higher input costs, ensuring that we're getting priced where the market will accept those price increases. As I think about 2023, and I think one of the benefits of our portfolio is that we do -- on our program side of the house, which is about 50% of what we do or 75%, including the cost side piece, it tends to be shorter in nature in terms of period of performance. And so our average period of performance is about 12 to 18 months. And so if you think about this increased inflationary environment starting in the middle of this year, I anticipate that, by the end of next year, we've worked through that backlog that was priced in the pre-inflationary environment. And so I think that's one of the advantages that we have, given our shorter cycle nature, but it also plays into how are we thinking about guidance for next year and going back to -- there's multiple variables that we're taking into consideration, that being one of them. Good morning. Yeah. And just timing-wise, Ron, to your question, this was as a result of going through our strategic plan process and aligning with the overall DoD priorities. I think it's important to note with these two businesses that, we've been illuminating for a while that they're on the lower end of the portfolio from a growth perspective. So there's no surprises here. It's really just part of the annual assessment, if you will, in looking at where the priorities are from a budget perspective, with our strategic plan and then the recognition that these businesses were already on the bubble to begin with."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings. Welcome to the L3Harris Technologies Second Quarter Calendar Year 2022 Earnings Call. . As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2022 earnings call. We published our investor letter after the market closed yesterday, a streamlined format that we're pleased to continue, given the positive feedback. So today's call will be focused primarily on answering your questions.  Joining me for the call are Chris Kubasik, our CEO; and Michelle Turner, our CFO. A few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures.  Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our investor letter and SEC filings.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available.  With that, Chris, I'll turn it over to you for some brief comments.\nChristopher Kubasik: Okay. Thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. I'm encouraged by our progress as we continue to execute our trusted disruptor strategy. We're investing in targeted capabilities in and outside of the company, and we've had over $1 billion of notable prime awards this month alone. And we're pursuing international expansion as our customers need mission-critical solutions in a rapidly changing threat environment.  We're also encouraged by how budgets are shaping up globally. The threats are evident, and there's growing urgency to support defense spending in the U.S., NATO and elsewhere. This is a stark contrast to a couple of years ago, where budgets were expected to be flat at best.  Our book-to-bill of 1.14x in the quarter supports this shift in the budget environment. At the same time, there are factors outside of our control, such as supply chain, inflation and labor markets tightening that are offsetting and masking our progress as well as the opportunities ahead. Our results, however, highlight that we're working to mitigate these challenges.  Our second quarter results are consistent with prior commentary of a back half weighted year for revenues, margins and cash. Nonetheless, we kept EPS relatively stable year-over-year and our free cash flow stepped back from breakeven last quarter to more than $700 million.  In addition, while we're reiterating our guide, we're now pointing to the low end of the range across the board.  Based on the timing of some key awards, including protest activity and a prolonged supply chain recovery, we decided to take a more measured approach, especially given the macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties that are somewhat unpredictable. So despite the noise, we continue to execute on our strategy.  With that, Rob, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: . Our first question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays.\nDavid Strauss: Chris, can you give us a lay of the land on F-35 and Tech Refresh 3? And whether you still see about $150 million headwind there this year before beginning to recover in '23? And then bigger picture, the investor letter did a great job of highlighting the budget upside that came through in '22 and the plus ups could look likely in '23.  When do you think that really begin to materialize for the industry in terms of seeing it come through in terms of the numbers? And how do you think your strategy positions you to capture that upside relative to your peers?\nChristopher Kubasik: All right. Thanks, David. I think there were about three questions in there. Let me see if I can get them. Let me start with F-35.  Usually, I give a long answer and list all the components that we're involved with, but it really comes down to the ICP, the integrated core processor.  So today, I think I'm going to give you a shorter answer because we actually completed the safety of flight certification, and the first flight systems were delivered to Lockheed Martin last month. So great news relative to TR3 and meeting that delivery, a little late, but nonetheless, it's progressing.  So our last 15 hardware starts getting delivered later this year, and the whole focus here is to support Lockheed to enable their 2023 aircraft delivery. So feeling much better about the progress the team has made. I know they worked a lot of long nights and weekends to get here. So I appreciate that effort. And your financial numbers remain accurate, based on what we've told you before.  Relative to the strategy, I think it's working. We've talked about this trusted disruptor strategy with more innovation, more prime and more international. So when I look at the innovation, this quarter, we made a small investment in a free space optic company called Minarik.  We've had a handful of investments with Shield through our venture capital. And we continue to spend a fair amount in high R&D to position us for new wins.  The goal to prime more has been great last year with an earlier this year, significant wins in ISR and MUSV, HBTSS. And of course, we've been winning a majority of the share on the radio modernization program.  I mentioned, so far this year, SDA tracking Tranche 1 was a big win. And here in the month of July, we were also awarded CEC, which is a Cooperative Engagement Capability, really a pillar of the JADC2 initiative for the Navy, which I'm quite excited about.  And another program we're priming called EAGL, which is the Expeditionary Advanced Ground Link, again, tied to free space optics. So pretty excited there.  And then internationally, at a high level, we've had mid-single-digit growth the past couple of years. Our book-to-bill has always been over 1.0x. And I think the ability to have these focused countries and put the resources where we think the opportunities are makes a lot of sense.  And just last month, we added Poland and Italy to our focus country program, given the opportunities over in Europe. As far as when we're going to see it. I think it's just a matter of getting the '23 budget. We've been tracking the markups. We're very excited to see that our programs are supported. The opportunities we're chasing are supported.  So whether the base budget or the markup, we're very well positioned, including some of the news coming out of the Senate earlier this week. So we basically need a budget. So I think everybody thinks there'll be a CR. So I'm guessing '23, when the awards are made, we'll start to see industry and L3Harris benefit.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: I'm going to try to follow the rules. Just a follow-up on David's question for SAS. The top line is accelerating to mid-single-digit growth from low single-digit decline in the first half.  Can you talk about the drivers of that improvement? How much is coming from the space business accelerating versus better avionics and EW volumes? And how do you think about the growth going forward, given some of the progress on F-35?\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes, I'll take the first shot, and then maybe ask Michelle to give a little more color on the sector. But space is clearly our fastest-growing sector in the company. This win that we had earlier this month for SDA tracking Tranche 1 is just a huge opportunity.  If you recall, we won Tranche 0 for 4 satellites. This is 14 satellites. Pretty excited about this particular win. And again, it's an example where we're priming. We have the payload capabilities, and that's ultimately where the value resides.  So as a reminder, $700 million award, 14 satellites, and it really ties into our responsive satellite strategy. A couple of years ago, it was nonexistent. Now we have satellites in low earth orbit, medium earth orbit and geosynchronous orbit. So it's really going well.  I think at the date of the merger, we had no business with the Missile Defense Agency. Now we're smack in the middle of that growing business line. So I'm really pleased with where we are. I think the other day, Michelle and I were looking, we have about a $20 billion pipeline in space alone.  And when you look at our capabilities in missile defense, weather, like I mentioned, all orbits and even ground capabilities, it's quite exciting.  But Michelle, you want to talk about the rest of the sector?\nMichelle Turner: Yes. No. You did a nice summary in space in terms of high to mid-single digits in terms of growth. From a Mission Avionics perspective, this is the ramp that we talked about on F-35. So as we head into production, you'll see that come in the second half.  And then also, Chris didn't mention it, but Intel and Cyber, right? Our classified business is continuing to grow as well, and we'll expect to see that ramp in the second half as well.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Elizabeth on for Ron. Can you give some color on what you're seeing on the chip side of the supply chain and whether you're seeing an easing there? Or any sort of color you might be able to provide would be great.\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. Let me start. Just at a high level, I think at least at L3Harris, I think the whole industry has now realized there's a new norm in supply chain. And we're adapting to that as quickly as we can.  In the past, the whole focus was just-in-time inventory, inventory reductions, single sources. And you'd always go with the low-cost bidder without serious consideration on the certainty of supply and delivery.  So we have multiple work streams going in parallel. And I think we're doing a pretty good job in the short term, trying to mitigate and avoid the disruptions, but we're also looking how we revamp our supply chain resiliency for the long term.  So I've mentioned in the past, we've invested in tools to get end-to-end visibility beyond Tier 1. We're investing in critical materials, smart inventory, safety stock, which I understand builds our inventory balance. You'll see that on our balance sheet, but I think it's the right business decision.  And we're trying to move to more localized and distributed production to shorten the whole supply chain network to get our parts even quicker. And then we're looking at multiple sources for every part. So a complete turnaround, almost a 180, from where we were 3 years ago. But this is the new norm, in our opinion. This is what we're doing. Michelle, do you want to talk a little bit about the headwinds in the recovery?\nMichelle Turner: Yes. So just to frame it a little bit in terms of the numbers. To Chris' point, what's the same, right? So coming into the year, we anticipated that we would see a first half impact, particularly within electronic components. We are seeing that play out in terms of our first half results.  Additionally, we also talked about seeing sequential quarter-over-year improvement. We are seeing that from Q4 into Q1, additionally from Q1 into Q2. Albeit it is more modest than what we originally anticipated in our original guide back in January.  So when you look at our guidance update, pointing to the low end of the range, part of that is, to Chris' point, this elongation of the supply chain impacts that we're seeing out of '22 and into 2023.  I'd also highlight the risk mitigations that Chris talked about, in particular in terms of how those are working. We've been talking for 6 months about moving away from sole-source suppliers along with redesigning parts. We're continuing to work those activities. Many of those start to come online in the second half.  And so that is part of where we're getting some of our confidence in terms of the recovery in second half with the results of those actions starting to take effect.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran from Seaport Global.\nRichard Safran: So I thought you might comment on the SOCOM Armed Overwatch program, where you're competing with Textron. And also, could you talk a bit more about the improvement you mentioned in commercial aviation? I'm interested in what the back half growth outlook might be for that business. And if you think the momentum continues into 2023?\nChristopher Kubasik: Right, Rich, let me take Armed Overwatch, and Michelle will talk to you about aviation. So yes, this is a program that goes back into late '19 and early 2020. And we decided to take a clean sheet approach to this program to align with the requirements.  Team has spent a fair amount of money in R&D and capital. We've had lots of demos that have gone well that we think position us in a good place to potentially win this program.  It's for 75 aircraft. It's clearly a couple of billion dollar opportunity here domestically and even more, internationally. There's a lot of need for this type of capability in countries that are fighting terrorism.  We've had discussions with countries in Africa, the Middle East. I think, it is where the initial potential is, whether it's border protection or maritime operations, light strike, ISR, pretty flexible, pretty affordable program.  So we kind of have to wait and see. Hopefully, something comes out in the next week or 2. And I think it's a key one to watch, in my opinion. I know it's important to our company, and it really would validate our strategy and the thesis for the merger because we invested in the innovation.  We started with a clean sheet. It's another opportunity to be a prime integrator, it has international potential. And it also has pull-through of our products, Wescam turrets, radios, weapon carriages and EW capabilities.  So we'll see what happens. I'm pretty excited about it. And maybe with that, we'll go to Michelle.\nMichelle Turner: Yes. And I would just add to the Armed Overwatch in terms of second half ramp. When you look at our overall ISR business, this is part of our expectations in terms of growth, particularly around these aircraft missionization.  We didn't have those in the first half. So we're chasing 3 to 5 programs here, this is one of them. And so to Chris' point, we're excited about seeing this come online and hearing about a potential win.  Back to the question on the commercial aviation. So we are continuing to see recovery. This will be our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The first half of the year, our overall commercial businesses, which also includes our Public Safety, was up double digits. And we anticipate that, that's going to continue through the end of 2022.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird.\nPeter Arment: Chris, circling back a little bit to David's question on the budget. So 40% of L3's international revenues are in Europe. And I guess your total international book-to-bill has been averaging around 1 or above 1 in the past 12 months.  I guess specifically, what do you see kind of playing out for L3 in Europe? I mean, should we expect bookings to accelerate in '23? Any kind of color there, just given all the budget actions and the Ukraine activity?\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. No, I appreciate the question, Peter. Clearly, we have opportunities in Europe. We've talked about some ISR capabilities that we've been -- we've already won in the past, where we continue to add aircraft, and we have a path to get to 8 aircraft for this particular country.  Clearly, with Ukraine, I think we have a core competency and a lot of experience working with the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, the USAI money, that's always been in the budget. So clearly, the radios, the night vision goggles, even some ISR capabilities, position us well there.  And as I mentioned, we're going to open offices in Europe, the NATO countries. Poland is a big opportunity, where we've submitted a few a few bids, again, with comms, resilient comms, SATCOM, at a high level. That's where I see us making the most progress in the near term and even impacting our 2022 financials favorably and expect it to continue into '23.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.\nDouglas Harned: I wanted to try to understand what's going on in Tactical Communications a little bit better. You've had a rising backlog, but at the same time you've been constrained with supply chain issues.  And what I wanted to get is to understand once -- first, once the supply chain constraints ease up, what kind of trajectory do you expect to see as radios are delivered, a big surge or more of a long-term better growth outlook?  And then along with that, we've seen you keep your margins. Margins have held pretty well, even though we've got a lot of inflation exposure and you've got the supply chain issues. I mean, how do you see the risks around margin there as you go forward, if we see persistent inflation?\nChristopher Kubasik: Okay. Thanks. Let me make a few points, and then Michelle will give you the numbers. I mean, you're absolutely right. There's high demand for our radios, and I think that's one thing that the conflict in Ukraine has highlighted, the importance of resilient comms. So we have opportunities in Australia, 300 million for what's called Deltic Phase 2 with the Australian Defense Force. That's over 6,000 radios. We should hear on that maybe in the next month or 2.  We've talked about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the radios there. The first 4,000 or so cleared congressional notification. And in August, we're going to have our first article acceptance up in Rochester, and they've ordered a couple of thousand more. So that's going through the congressional notification process.  In the U.K., the Morpheus program, again, $100 million award approximately. So all those things are building the backlog, as you say. I will highlight that I think it was last year, we knew there was a supply chain shortage and we'd have to serve. So we invested in the capacity.  So we now have more capacity. Michelle will give you the numbers, but we can clearly do better and grow without any constraints.  Last year, we had about 20 suppliers on our red list, and now we're down to 5 that we're watching carefully. And obviously, we need all the parts, but that's been pretty helpful.  The last thing I'll mention before giving to Michelle, I've talked in the past how we reengineer and redesign our products or our components, based on availability.  And just this week, I was looking at our data, we've actually redesigned over 1,000 component parts in our products, whether it's radios, night vision goggles, WESCAM balls to be able to make these commitments and continue to deliver our products. So I'm pretty proud of our engineering team and how they've been able to adapt.  So that's kind of at a high level. Michelle, you want to talk about the capacity and the ramp capability?\nMichelle Turner: Yes. So Doug, so just to your point, in the first half, we did -- consistent with our expectations, we did see our Tactical Communications down low double digits, really driven by the electronic component constraints. As we go into second half, we expect that, that's going to grow in the high double digits. So to your point, we expect that, that starts to ease from a capacity perspective. We've made the investments that Chris talked about and continuing to see the electronic components improve. It's going to be critical for the second half and as we go into 2023.  We do have an elevated backlog, to your point. It's about 1.5 billion. So we have a healthy backlog that we'll be looking at as we go into 2023. And additionally, I'd note to the international question, the international book-to-bill within Tactical Communcations is 1.15 within the quarter. And so this really speaks to the overall conflict environment, Ukraine opportunities that we're seeing.  And we expect that, that will be a benefit for us as we go into 2023, but a lot of these orders are also being considered over a couple of years. And so you should think about it in terms of 2023, 2024 and into 2025.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research.\nRobert Stallard: Chris, I was wondering if you could comment on this NSO situation and what happened there? And in conjunction with that, whether you have any additional M&A deals potentially in the pipeline?\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. I would say, clearly, relative to our M&A pipeline, we're looking at opportunities all the time, looking for game-changing solutions that are going to help us with our customers.  So yes, we're looking at a handful. We continue to look at M&A on a regular basis. We're also watching the regulatory environment and seeing what could potentially be approved and any potential overlap or antitrust issues.  So I'd say, we have a healthy process. We look at things all the time, and I don't see us in a position to announce anything in the next quarter or 2, but we'll continue to look.  Relative to NSO, we're fully aligned with the U.S. national security leadership on this matter. And I think all the reporting out there made it clear that no deal is going to happen, at least with us. So maybe someone else is talking to them, but not me. So I hope that helps.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global.\nPeter Skibitski: Chris, something you're probably super frustrated about, but this next-gen jammer, low-band ongoing protest. Can you give us any sense of -- for key dates or milestones in terms of kind of getting that resolved? I know it's dragged on probably way longer than anyone expected.\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. Yes. Well, Pete, I don't really get frustrated about much, but this has taken a longer time than anybody wanted. So there's going to be a re-procurement between us and Northrop. We all signed an agreement as to a path forward. So I expect to get into RFP in the next month or 2. We'll update our proposal.  And I would think, in mid-2023, hopefully earlier, 2023, that maybe we'll make a selection and we'll move on. It's really about the capabilities that the Navy needs and the threats that we keep talking about.  And we'll -- we respect the process to allow people to protest, and I think there's been 4 or 5 different judges and reviews and such, but it's progressing. So it was over $100 million of revenue we had in our plan for this year.  So that's kind of given us a little headwind. We'll move it into '23. The team is ready to go. We like our technology. We like our solution, and we'll wait for the Navy to select us again, hopefully.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.\nNoah Poponak: Wondered if you could just talk a little bit more about the back half as you see it now, relative to the prior guide? The acceleration in organic revenue growth to mid-single, how much of that's 3Q versus 4Q? How much visibility you have versus things that could slide? And then if there's anything on the cash flow side in terms of payment timing that you're looking at as well?\nMichelle Turner: Yes, I'll jump in, and then Chris, you can feel free to complement. So in the second half, to your point, in terms of the drivers, it's really 3 components. One is around supply chain recovery. And so as I noted earlier, we had an assumption that we'd have a pretty healthy hockey stick going into the back half of the year.  As we're seeing the supply chain environment elongate into 2023, we've mitigated that a bit in terms of the change in the guide to the lower end of the range, although we still do have a hockey stick going into the second half.  I will note, though, that as we're sitting here in Q3, we have similar challenges to what we had in Q1 and Q2. And so the risk profile is very consistent to what we delivered on in the first half.  The second is around new program wins. Chris mentioned SDA, along with SPEIR. These are 2 new awards that we've already won. And so the back half, we will be accelerating as those programs come online.  And then the third piece is around our ISR missionization programs. We talked about Armed Overwatch. There are a number of other ISR missionization programs that we are pursuing. We expect those awards to happen within Q3, with a ramp happening in Q4.  And Noah, to your point, between Q3 and Q4, I would say, it's fairly consistent. You're not going to see another hockey stick from Q3 to Q4. So hitting expectations in Q3 is what we're focused on now, with that expected to continue into the fourth quarter.\nChristopher Kubasik: I'll just chime in, Noah. At a higher level, the approach we've taken, and we talked to the leadership team, is let's just control the controllables. There's a lot of frustration, I think, out there in the system. And we're kind of taking the approach that -- the last 2 years have clearly been unprecedented, whether it's pandemic, Ukraine, inflation, supply chain, all the stuff we know.  So when we give the guidance for the second half that Michelle laid out, we want to let you know it's kind of hard -- it's harder than it has been in the last several decades to predict the future and the visibility, given the uncertainty and the volatility that changes literally on a daily basis.  There are some days where we get a call from a supplier that they're going to be a week late. And the next day, someone shows up a week early. I mean, it's really very, very dynamic. We're trying to stay calm and relax and control what we can control and mitigate those things that we can't and then communicate to the best of our ability what the upside and the downside is.  The interesting thing is we're just talking about a ballway in all cases. We're not losing things. Sometimes they take longer to get awarded and sometimes they slip, but we're looking forward to the new norm and some of these uncertainties dissipating.\nMichelle Turner: And Noah, just to go back to your question in terms of cash. The expectation for the second half is really split between Q3 and Q4, more like a 30-70 split.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Morgan Stanley, at Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.\nKristine Liwag: You were down selected for Phase I of the stand-and-attack weapon. So a strike weapon like this sounds like relatively new territory for LHX. And you're up against competitors with strong missile heritage.  Can you talk about your strategy here? Is the missile market something you're focusing on more generally? Or is there something about this program that plays to your traditional strength?\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. No, that's a great, great question. We started investing in weapons, I think, going back 4 or 5 years. When -- I mentioned we set up the Agile Development Group. This is right in their sweet spot. We have multiple classified opportunities.  This is an air-to-ground tactical missile. I think it's -- when you look at the budget, you look at the threats, you look at our capabilities, I think we're in really good shape here. We've taken a clean sheet approach. And I think that's what's going to be the differentiator.  I mentioned that on Armed Overwatch. I mentioned it here, right? We're not taking an existing capability that's been successful for decades and tweaking it. We're taking a clean sheet approach.  We're investing in our in our Seekers, which I think is unique and has great capabilities. And I'm proud of the team to see us get down selected on this one. There's classified things where we're also getting down selected.  Like anything, it starts out a little slow. I think there's 3 of us. I know there's 3 of us. And sometime in August, we'll get the Gate 2 award. And I think in 2023, early '23, they'll probably down select to 2, and then the fly offs and the fund begin.  So this is clearly a core competency for us. It's a market that I like. And I think it's similar to what I've talked about. It's going to disrupt the market. And I think a lot of people were surprised when they hear L3Harris want a stand-and-attack weapon. And there'll be more of this in the years ahead.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro, Shapiro Research.\nGeorge Shapiro: I was wondering on the cash flow, your inventories are up like 260 million in the first half. I assume some of that's due to supply chain issues. Where do you expect that to go? Or where does it need to go for you to meet your cash flow guidance because obviously, like usual, it's much more second half weighted than first half?\nMichelle Turner: Yes. Thanks for the question, George. So when you look at our first half versus second half, you're absolutely right. Most of our cash generation is in the second half, with a healthy amount of that coming from working capital reduction assumptions.  And so to your point about the inventories, clearly, we are building in anticipation of that second half ramp. And so when you look at our product-based revenues, which is about 25% of our overall portfolio, that is a key driver in terms of our sales uptick within the second half.  The other piece I would note is within our ISR missionization business, to the extent that we are buying aircraft in anticipation of those programs coming online in the second half, that also sits within the inventory.  And so Chris noted several programs that we're pursuing. We anticipate a couple of those happening of the 4 or 5 we're pursuing in the second half. And so that will alleviate the inventory pressures as well to allow us to meet the cash expectations.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research.\nRobert Spingarn: Chris, I wanted to extrapolate on some of these prior questions about hockey sticks and recovery. With all these noncontrollable headwinds that you talked about in '22, so the elongated supply chain impact and slow outlays and tight labor, et cetera, and then the strong bookings, rising budgets, could '23 or '24 be a spring-loaded year?  In other words, you don't necessarily capture in the back half of this year, but then we have sort of a monster year in '23 or '24. And could that in and of itself present capacity issues? And then for Michelle, just how much risk is there to this year's guide if we have a CR in Q4, especially now that you're pointing to the low end of the guidance?\nChristopher Kubasik: Okay. No, great questions. And to answer the first one, I mean, you kind of got to it. The CR is going to be something that could obviously impact '23. I think you called it a monster year, is that what you said? So I'd love a monster year, whenever that is.  But no, the capacity, I don't see as being an issue. We invested in the prior years. We have a world-class factory, if you will, out in Salt Lake City for the Broadband Communication Systems business. They've had a great couple of months here with the win of CEC, the Cooperative Engagement Capability I mentioned earlier, which is JADC2, the EAGL program.  Of course, they'll hopefully get next-gen jammer. So we've made those investments up in Canada. We've invested in a new facility for WESCAM, where we're seeing the surge in the turret. We mentioned the extra capital that we spent in Rochester.  So for the product quick turn businesses, I think we have the capability. Labor is probably more of a potential constraint than the actual facilities themselves. If we get the supply chain turnaround, I think we'll be okay.  And we've been doing pretty good on the labor front. We've hired over 4,000 people so far this year. We have the same challenges with attrition that the rest of the industry does. But we're hiring interns. We're hiring new college grads.  I think it's a company that people find interesting and exciting, and we're getting literally hundreds of thousands of resumes to come work for us. So I feel pretty good about that.  Relative to '23, we're actually going through our strategic planning process now. We talk about low to mid-single-digit growth, but some of the stuff is pretty lumpy. And we should be in a position if we can get these wins to continue our top line and bottom line growth. Michelle?\nMichelle Turner: Yes. So in regards to the question on CR, our guide assumes that there is some level of a CR in the second -- in Q4 of this year.\nOperator: Our final question will be from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Maybe can you guys just quantify what the margin headwinds are that are coming from inflation and labor? I don't know if you could parse out what's sort of the bigger impact. And I think the investor letter mentioned that you've got a relatively quick turn or short-duration backlog.  Maybe you can walk us through how long it takes to flow through price increases on raw materials or higher billing rates? And how we should maybe think about the margin evolution as you can pass through some of those prices?\nMichelle Turner: Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. So consistent with what we shared back in our last call, we anticipate about $100 million of gross inflationary impacts within the year. We had about $20 million of that play out within Q2.  And to your point about our overall program mix, about 50% of our portfolio is fixed price. It's about a year in terms of duration. And so we're starting to see some of the inflationary pressures prior to having EPA clauses in our contracts starting to play out here in the second half of the year.  We'll see that into 2023. Where we're focusing on what we can control right now is ensuring a new contracts that we are placing clauses that allow for this inflationary environment. But we anticipate that through the middle of next year to probably Q3, Q4. We'll see some remnants of the impacts of the current economy and the inflationary environment.  Okay. So before ending the call, I want to take a moment to recognize our 47,000 strong L3Harris teammates around the globe. And thank you for remaining focus on creating value for all of our stakeholders, particularly in support of meeting our customers' critical missions.  What you do matters in terms of making the world a safer place. Thanks, everyone, for your time today, and have a great weekend. We look forward to connecting again in the next few months.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christopher Kubasik",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. I'm encouraged by our progress as we continue to execute our trusted disruptor strategy. We're investing in targeted capabilities in and outside of the company, and we've had over $1 billion of notable prime awards this month alone. And we're pursuing international expansion as our customers need mission-critical solutions in a rapidly changing threat environment.  We're also encouraged by how budgets are shaping up globally. The threats are evident, and there's growing urgency to support defense spending in the U.S., NATO and elsewhere. This is a stark contrast to a couple of years ago, where budgets were expected to be flat at best.  Our book-to-bill of 1.14x in the quarter supports this shift in the budget environment. At the same time, there are factors outside of our control, such as supply chain, inflation and labor markets tightening that are offsetting and masking our progress as well as the opportunities ahead. Our results, however, highlight that we're working to mitigate these challenges.  Our second quarter results are consistent with prior commentary of a back half weighted year for revenues, margins and cash. Nonetheless, we kept EPS relatively stable year-over-year and our free cash flow stepped back from breakeven last quarter to more than $700 million.  In addition, while we're reiterating our guide, we're now pointing to the low end of the range across the board.  Based on the timing of some key awards, including protest activity and a prolonged supply chain recovery, we decided to take a more measured approach, especially given the macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties that are somewhat unpredictable. So despite the noise, we continue to execute on our strategy.  With that, Rob, let's open the line for questions. All right. Thanks, David. I think there were about three questions in there. Let me see if I can get them. Let me start with F-35.  Usually, I give a long answer and list all the components that we're involved with, but it really comes down to the ICP, the integrated core processor.  So today, I think I'm going to give you a shorter answer because we actually completed the safety of flight certification, and the first flight systems were delivered to Lockheed Martin last month. So great news relative to TR3 and meeting that delivery, a little late, but nonetheless, it's progressing.  So our last 15 hardware starts getting delivered later this year, and the whole focus here is to support Lockheed to enable their 2023 aircraft delivery. So feeling much better about the progress the team has made. I know they worked a lot of long nights and weekends to get here. So I appreciate that effort. And your financial numbers remain accurate, based on what we've told you before.  Relative to the strategy, I think it's working. We've talked about this trusted disruptor strategy with more innovation, more prime and more international. So when I look at the innovation, this quarter, we made a small investment in a free space optic company called Minarik.  We've had a handful of investments with Shield through our venture capital. And we continue to spend a fair amount in high R&D to position us for new wins.  The goal to prime more has been great last year with an earlier this year, significant wins in ISR and MUSV, HBTSS. And of course, we've been winning a majority of the share on the radio modernization program.  I mentioned, so far this year, SDA tracking Tranche 1 was a big win. And here in the month of July, we were also awarded CEC, which is a Cooperative Engagement Capability, really a pillar of the JADC2 initiative for the Navy, which I'm quite excited about.  And another program we're priming called EAGL, which is the Expeditionary Advanced Ground Link, again, tied to free space optics. So pretty excited there.  And then internationally, at a high level, we've had mid-single-digit growth the past couple of years. Our book-to-bill has always been over 1.0x. And I think the ability to have these focused countries and put the resources where we think the opportunities are makes a lot of sense.  And just last month, we added Poland and Italy to our focus country program, given the opportunities over in Europe. As far as when we're going to see it. I think it's just a matter of getting the '23 budget. We've been tracking the markups. We're very excited to see that our programs are supported. The opportunities we're chasing are supported.  So whether the base budget or the markup, we're very well positioned, including some of the news coming out of the Senate earlier this week. So we basically need a budget. So I think everybody thinks there'll be a CR. So I'm guessing '23, when the awards are made, we'll start to see industry and L3Harris benefit. Yes, I'll take the first shot, and then maybe ask Michelle to give a little more color on the sector. But space is clearly our fastest-growing sector in the company. This win that we had earlier this month for SDA tracking Tranche 1 is just a huge opportunity.  If you recall, we won Tranche 0 for 4 satellites. This is 14 satellites. Pretty excited about this particular win. And again, it's an example where we're priming. We have the payload capabilities, and that's ultimately where the value resides.  So as a reminder, $700 million award, 14 satellites, and it really ties into our responsive satellite strategy. A couple of years ago, it was nonexistent. Now we have satellites in low earth orbit, medium earth orbit and geosynchronous orbit. So it's really going well.  I think at the date of the merger, we had no business with the Missile Defense Agency. Now we're smack in the middle of that growing business line. So I'm really pleased with where we are. I think the other day, Michelle and I were looking, we have about a $20 billion pipeline in space alone.  And when you look at our capabilities in missile defense, weather, like I mentioned, all orbits and even ground capabilities, it's quite exciting.  But Michelle, you want to talk about the rest of the sector? Yes. Let me start. Just at a high level, I think at least at L3Harris, I think the whole industry has now realized there's a new norm in supply chain. And we're adapting to that as quickly as we can.  In the past, the whole focus was just-in-time inventory, inventory reductions, single sources. And you'd always go with the low-cost bidder without serious consideration on the certainty of supply and delivery.  So we have multiple work streams going in parallel. And I think we're doing a pretty good job in the short term, trying to mitigate and avoid the disruptions, but we're also looking how we revamp our supply chain resiliency for the long term.  So I've mentioned in the past, we've invested in tools to get end-to-end visibility beyond Tier 1. We're investing in critical materials, smart inventory, safety stock, which I understand builds our inventory balance. You'll see that on our balance sheet, but I think it's the right business decision.  And we're trying to move to more localized and distributed production to shorten the whole supply chain network to get our parts even quicker. And then we're looking at multiple sources for every part. So a complete turnaround, almost a 180, from where we were 3 years ago. But this is the new norm, in our opinion. This is what we're doing. Michelle, do you want to talk a little bit about the headwinds in the recovery? Right, Rich, let me take Armed Overwatch, and Michelle will talk to you about aviation. So yes, this is a program that goes back into late '19 and early 2020. And we decided to take a clean sheet approach to this program to align with the requirements.  Team has spent a fair amount of money in R&D and capital. We've had lots of demos that have gone well that we think position us in a good place to potentially win this program.  It's for 75 aircraft. It's clearly a couple of billion dollar opportunity here domestically and even more, internationally. There's a lot of need for this type of capability in countries that are fighting terrorism.  We've had discussions with countries in Africa, the Middle East. I think, it is where the initial potential is, whether it's border protection or maritime operations, light strike, ISR, pretty flexible, pretty affordable program.  So we kind of have to wait and see. Hopefully, something comes out in the next week or 2. And I think it's a key one to watch, in my opinion. I know it's important to our company, and it really would validate our strategy and the thesis for the merger because we invested in the innovation.  We started with a clean sheet. It's another opportunity to be a prime integrator, it has international potential. And it also has pull-through of our products, Wescam turrets, radios, weapon carriages and EW capabilities.  So we'll see what happens. I'm pretty excited about it. And maybe with that, we'll go to Michelle. Yes. No, I appreciate the question, Peter. Clearly, we have opportunities in Europe. We've talked about some ISR capabilities that we've been -- we've already won in the past, where we continue to add aircraft, and we have a path to get to 8 aircraft for this particular country.  Clearly, with Ukraine, I think we have a core competency and a lot of experience working with the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, the USAI money, that's always been in the budget. So clearly, the radios, the night vision goggles, even some ISR capabilities, position us well there.  And as I mentioned, we're going to open offices in Europe, the NATO countries. Poland is a big opportunity, where we've submitted a few a few bids, again, with comms, resilient comms, SATCOM, at a high level. That's where I see us making the most progress in the near term and even impacting our 2022 financials favorably and expect it to continue into '23. Okay. Thanks. Let me make a few points, and then Michelle will give you the numbers. I mean, you're absolutely right. There's high demand for our radios, and I think that's one thing that the conflict in Ukraine has highlighted, the importance of resilient comms. So we have opportunities in Australia, 300 million for what's called Deltic Phase 2 with the Australian Defense Force. That's over 6,000 radios. We should hear on that maybe in the next month or 2.  We've talked about the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the radios there. The first 4,000 or so cleared congressional notification. And in August, we're going to have our first article acceptance up in Rochester, and they've ordered a couple of thousand more. So that's going through the congressional notification process.  In the U.K., the Morpheus program, again, $100 million award approximately. So all those things are building the backlog, as you say. I will highlight that I think it was last year, we knew there was a supply chain shortage and we'd have to serve. So we invested in the capacity.  So we now have more capacity. Michelle will give you the numbers, but we can clearly do better and grow without any constraints.  Last year, we had about 20 suppliers on our red list, and now we're down to 5 that we're watching carefully. And obviously, we need all the parts, but that's been pretty helpful.  The last thing I'll mention before giving to Michelle, I've talked in the past how we reengineer and redesign our products or our components, based on availability.  And just this week, I was looking at our data, we've actually redesigned over 1,000 component parts in our products, whether it's radios, night vision goggles, WESCAM balls to be able to make these commitments and continue to deliver our products. So I'm pretty proud of our engineering team and how they've been able to adapt.  So that's kind of at a high level. Michelle, you want to talk about the capacity and the ramp capability? Yes. I would say, clearly, relative to our M&A pipeline, we're looking at opportunities all the time, looking for game-changing solutions that are going to help us with our customers.  So yes, we're looking at a handful. We continue to look at M&A on a regular basis. We're also watching the regulatory environment and seeing what could potentially be approved and any potential overlap or antitrust issues.  So I'd say, we have a healthy process. We look at things all the time, and I don't see us in a position to announce anything in the next quarter or 2, but we'll continue to look.  Relative to NSO, we're fully aligned with the U.S. national security leadership on this matter. And I think all the reporting out there made it clear that no deal is going to happen, at least with us. So maybe someone else is talking to them, but not me. So I hope that helps. Yes. Yes. Well, Pete, I don't really get frustrated about much, but this has taken a longer time than anybody wanted. So there's going to be a re-procurement between us and Northrop. We all signed an agreement as to a path forward. So I expect to get into RFP in the next month or 2. We'll update our proposal.  And I would think, in mid-2023, hopefully earlier, 2023, that maybe we'll make a selection and we'll move on. It's really about the capabilities that the Navy needs and the threats that we keep talking about.  And we'll -- we respect the process to allow people to protest, and I think there's been 4 or 5 different judges and reviews and such, but it's progressing. So it was over $100 million of revenue we had in our plan for this year.  So that's kind of given us a little headwind. We'll move it into '23. The team is ready to go. We like our technology. We like our solution, and we'll wait for the Navy to select us again, hopefully. I'll just chime in, Noah. At a higher level, the approach we've taken, and we talked to the leadership team, is let's just control the controllables. There's a lot of frustration, I think, out there in the system. And we're kind of taking the approach that -- the last 2 years have clearly been unprecedented, whether it's pandemic, Ukraine, inflation, supply chain, all the stuff we know.  So when we give the guidance for the second half that Michelle laid out, we want to let you know it's kind of hard -- it's harder than it has been in the last several decades to predict the future and the visibility, given the uncertainty and the volatility that changes literally on a daily basis.  There are some days where we get a call from a supplier that they're going to be a week late. And the next day, someone shows up a week early. I mean, it's really very, very dynamic. We're trying to stay calm and relax and control what we can control and mitigate those things that we can't and then communicate to the best of our ability what the upside and the downside is.  The interesting thing is we're just talking about a ballway in all cases. We're not losing things. Sometimes they take longer to get awarded and sometimes they slip, but we're looking forward to the new norm and some of these uncertainties dissipating. Yes. No, that's a great, great question. We started investing in weapons, I think, going back 4 or 5 years. When -- I mentioned we set up the Agile Development Group. This is right in their sweet spot. We have multiple classified opportunities.  This is an air-to-ground tactical missile. I think it's -- when you look at the budget, you look at the threats, you look at our capabilities, I think we're in really good shape here. We've taken a clean sheet approach. And I think that's what's going to be the differentiator.  I mentioned that on Armed Overwatch. I mentioned it here, right? We're not taking an existing capability that's been successful for decades and tweaking it. We're taking a clean sheet approach.  We're investing in our in our Seekers, which I think is unique and has great capabilities. And I'm proud of the team to see us get down selected on this one. There's classified things where we're also getting down selected.  Like anything, it starts out a little slow. I think there's 3 of us. I know there's 3 of us. And sometime in August, we'll get the Gate 2 award. And I think in 2023, early '23, they'll probably down select to 2, and then the fly offs and the fund begin.  So this is clearly a core competency for us. It's a market that I like. And I think it's similar to what I've talked about. It's going to disrupt the market. And I think a lot of people were surprised when they hear L3Harris want a stand-and-attack weapon. And there'll be more of this in the years ahead. Okay. No, great questions. And to answer the first one, I mean, you kind of got to it. The CR is going to be something that could obviously impact '23. I think you called it a monster year, is that what you said? So I'd love a monster year, whenever that is.  But no, the capacity, I don't see as being an issue. We invested in the prior years. We have a world-class factory, if you will, out in Salt Lake City for the Broadband Communication Systems business. They've had a great couple of months here with the win of CEC, the Cooperative Engagement Capability I mentioned earlier, which is JADC2, the EAGL program.  Of course, they'll hopefully get next-gen jammer. So we've made those investments up in Canada. We've invested in a new facility for WESCAM, where we're seeing the surge in the turret. We mentioned the extra capital that we spent in Rochester.  So for the product quick turn businesses, I think we have the capability. Labor is probably more of a potential constraint than the actual facilities themselves. If we get the supply chain turnaround, I think we'll be okay.  And we've been doing pretty good on the labor front. We've hired over 4,000 people so far this year. We have the same challenges with attrition that the rest of the industry does. But we're hiring interns. We're hiring new college grads.  I think it's a company that people find interesting and exciting, and we're getting literally hundreds of thousands of resumes to come work for us. So I feel pretty good about that.  Relative to '23, we're actually going through our strategic planning process now. We talk about low to mid-single-digit growth, but some of the stuff is pretty lumpy. And we should be in a position if we can get these wins to continue our top line and bottom line growth. Michelle?"

            "name": "Michelle Turner",
            "content": "Yes. No. You did a nice summary in space in terms of high to mid-single digits in terms of growth. From a Mission Avionics perspective, this is the ramp that we talked about on F-35. So as we head into production, you'll see that come in the second half.  And then also, Chris didn't mention it, but Intel and Cyber, right? Our classified business is continuing to grow as well, and we'll expect to see that ramp in the second half as well. Yes. So just to frame it a little bit in terms of the numbers. To Chris' point, what's the same, right? So coming into the year, we anticipated that we would see a first half impact, particularly within electronic components. We are seeing that play out in terms of our first half results.  Additionally, we also talked about seeing sequential quarter-over-year improvement. We are seeing that from Q4 into Q1, additionally from Q1 into Q2. Albeit it is more modest than what we originally anticipated in our original guide back in January.  So when you look at our guidance update, pointing to the low end of the range, part of that is, to Chris' point, this elongation of the supply chain impacts that we're seeing out of '22 and into 2023.  I'd also highlight the risk mitigations that Chris talked about, in particular in terms of how those are working. We've been talking for 6 months about moving away from sole-source suppliers along with redesigning parts. We're continuing to work those activities. Many of those start to come online in the second half.  And so that is part of where we're getting some of our confidence in terms of the recovery in second half with the results of those actions starting to take effect. Yes. And I would just add to the Armed Overwatch in terms of second half ramp. When you look at our overall ISR business, this is part of our expectations in terms of growth, particularly around these aircraft missionization.  We didn't have those in the first half. So we're chasing 3 to 5 programs here, this is one of them. And so to Chris' point, we're excited about seeing this come online and hearing about a potential win.  Back to the question on the commercial aviation. So we are continuing to see recovery. This will be our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The first half of the year, our overall commercial businesses, which also includes our Public Safety, was up double digits. And we anticipate that, that's going to continue through the end of 2022. Yes. So Doug, so just to your point, in the first half, we did -- consistent with our expectations, we did see our Tactical Communications down low double digits, really driven by the electronic component constraints. As we go into second half, we expect that, that's going to grow in the high double digits. So to your point, we expect that, that starts to ease from a capacity perspective. We've made the investments that Chris talked about and continuing to see the electronic components improve. It's going to be critical for the second half and as we go into 2023.  We do have an elevated backlog, to your point. It's about 1.5 billion. So we have a healthy backlog that we'll be looking at as we go into 2023. And additionally, I'd note to the international question, the international book-to-bill within Tactical Communcations is 1.15 within the quarter. And so this really speaks to the overall conflict environment, Ukraine opportunities that we're seeing.  And we expect that, that will be a benefit for us as we go into 2023, but a lot of these orders are also being considered over a couple of years. And so you should think about it in terms of 2023, 2024 and into 2025. Yes, I'll jump in, and then Chris, you can feel free to complement. So in the second half, to your point, in terms of the drivers, it's really 3 components. One is around supply chain recovery. And so as I noted earlier, we had an assumption that we'd have a pretty healthy hockey stick going into the back half of the year.  As we're seeing the supply chain environment elongate into 2023, we've mitigated that a bit in terms of the change in the guide to the lower end of the range, although we still do have a hockey stick going into the second half.  I will note, though, that as we're sitting here in Q3, we have similar challenges to what we had in Q1 and Q2. And so the risk profile is very consistent to what we delivered on in the first half.  The second is around new program wins. Chris mentioned SDA, along with SPEIR. These are 2 new awards that we've already won. And so the back half, we will be accelerating as those programs come online.  And then the third piece is around our ISR missionization programs. We talked about Armed Overwatch. There are a number of other ISR missionization programs that we are pursuing. We expect those awards to happen within Q3, with a ramp happening in Q4.  And Noah, to your point, between Q3 and Q4, I would say, it's fairly consistent. You're not going to see another hockey stick from Q3 to Q4. So hitting expectations in Q3 is what we're focused on now, with that expected to continue into the fourth quarter. And Noah, just to go back to your question in terms of cash. The expectation for the second half is really split between Q3 and Q4, more like a 30-70 split. Yes. Thanks for the question, George. So when you look at our first half versus second half, you're absolutely right. Most of our cash generation is in the second half, with a healthy amount of that coming from working capital reduction assumptions.  And so to your point about the inventories, clearly, we are building in anticipation of that second half ramp. And so when you look at our product-based revenues, which is about 25% of our overall portfolio, that is a key driver in terms of our sales uptick within the second half.  The other piece I would note is within our ISR missionization business, to the extent that we are buying aircraft in anticipation of those programs coming online in the second half, that also sits within the inventory.  And so Chris noted several programs that we're pursuing. We anticipate a couple of those happening of the 4 or 5 we're pursuing in the second half. And so that will alleviate the inventory pressures as well to allow us to meet the cash expectations. Yes. So in regards to the question on CR, our guide assumes that there is some level of a CR in the second -- in Q4 of this year. Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. So consistent with what we shared back in our last call, we anticipate about $100 million of gross inflationary impacts within the year. We had about $20 million of that play out within Q2.  And to your point about our overall program mix, about 50% of our portfolio is fixed price. It's about a year in terms of duration. And so we're starting to see some of the inflationary pressures prior to having EPA clauses in our contracts starting to play out here in the second half of the year.  We'll see that into 2023. Where we're focusing on what we can control right now is ensuring a new contracts that we are placing clauses that allow for this inflationary environment. But we anticipate that through the middle of next year to probably Q3, Q4. We'll see some remnants of the impacts of the current economy and the inflationary environment.  Okay. So before ending the call, I want to take a moment to recognize our 47,000 strong L3Harris teammates around the globe. And thank you for remaining focus on creating value for all of our stakeholders, particularly in support of meeting our customers' critical missions.  What you do matters in terms of making the world a safer place. Thanks, everyone, for your time today, and have a great weekend. We look forward to connecting again in the next few months."

Today\u2019s call will be focused on questions-and-answers following brief opening remarks. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Rajeev Lalwani, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may now begin.\nRajeev Lalwani: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. On the call with me today are Chris Kubasik, our CEO; and Michelle Turner, our CFO. First, a few words on forward-looking statements and non-GAAP measures. Forward-looking statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please see our investor letter and SEC filings. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to comparable GAAP measures is included in the Investor Relations section of our website, which is l3harris.com, where a replay of this call will also be available. And as a reminder, at the start of the year, we began reporting our results in our realigned three-segment structure that shifts pension items to the corporate level. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris for a few comments.\nChris Kubasik : Okay. Well, thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. As you saw, we released our results after the market closed yesterday in our new streamlined format. We're always looking at ways to improve and challenge the status quo. So instead of issuing a press release at 7:30 this morning, and have Michelle and I read prepared remarks, which were very similar to the press release and maybe with some added color, and then having you follow along with our web charts, which are just a graphic depiction of what we were going to say anyway. We thought we'd try something new and come out with what we're calling our investor letter and putting everything in one document.  And that allows us all the time today to focus on the questions and talk about what's on your mind. So just real quickly, the first quarter results are consistent with our prior commentary of a back half 2022 weighted revenue and margin plan. This will also be the case with our free cash flow as well. And for the full year, we're reiterating our guide across the board as we continue to advance our strategy in a dynamic environment, whether it's from the pandemic or the global threats in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. So before opening the line to questions, I'd like to express our steadfast support the people of Ukraine. I think we all agree their unwavering strength and resilience are a motivating force behind our mission here at L3Harris. So with that, Rob, let's open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Spingarn : Good morning. I wanted to ask you really a general question, to just elaborate on your Agile Development Group and the strategy behind the partnership with Shield Capital. Nut then something more specific on the flight test status for your integrated core processor for the F-35 Tech Refresh 3 and the possibility that delays on TR3 might push Block 4 out to fiscal '29 and how all this impacts the revenue back up that you previously talked about between TR2 and TR3?\nChris Kubasik : Okay. Why don't I take F-35 first, and then I'll ask Michelle to give you some of the financial numbers on F-35, then I'll come back and do ADG and Shield. So yeah, we talk about F-35 each quarter appropriately so. And I'll say this last quarter is probably the best quarter we've had in a while. We're progressing through the integration and test, which we all know is the most challenging part of any development program. And the integrated core processor did begin safety of flight testing earlier in March. So that is a good sign and progressing well. I do want to highlight, we do also have the Panoramic Cockpit Display, which just completed its safety of flight. And then the Aircraft Memory System completed its full qualification test. So everything is tracking well to the first flight. We just provide this to Lockheed, and I think in 2023 is going to be the first flight of the aircraft. So all seems to be going well. On the contractual side, we secured a contract for ICP for Lot 16 and for AMS and PCD on Lot 16 and 17. So we're getting to production contracts, and we're going to be ready to hit the ground running as we complete these tests. So as you'd expect, we're investing R&D and capital to continue to support the program and find more efficient ways to meet these commitments.  And I do want to recognize the team because we are working effectively three shifts and weekends. This is the highest priority for everyone. And we've had customer visits and they've been very complementary of the workforce and the progress that we're making.  So Michelle?\nMichelle Turner : Yeah. Good morning, Rob. So just to add a little bit of color from a financial perspective. So our overall Mission Avionics sector is going to be down mid-single digits, consistent with what we shared before. The F-35 development is going to be down low-double digits before we get into the ramp from a production perspective. So we anticipate going into next year that we'll be flattish to up a couple of percent.\nChris Kubasik : Yeah. So let me go back to the first question about the Agile Development Group and our investment in Shield. So you've heard us talk about our strategy of being a trusted disruptor investing more in R&D as a percentage of revenue than most trying to prime more contracts and embracing the new entrants that are disrupting the marketplace and the DoD. So we set up the Agile Development Group. It is an entity that had previously existed. So some of this is just kind of branding it and giving it the recognition it deserves. We have a couple of thousand engineers in this group. Their R&D is double digits as a percentage of revenue. And they're really the front end of the business. And they've been working with speed and agility and innovation. Most of the focus has been on modular open systems, which has been embraced by our customer. And it's hard to give examples because a lot of what we're doing is in the classified arena, initially focused on the air domain. We're also doing some interesting development on new and creative weapon systems.  So they're the front end. And as we get these contracts out of development and into production, they'll hand these off to another entity who is world-class at producing them. So I don't think it's the most unique thing in the industry, but it's something we thought made sense. And they're off to a pretty good start I've spent a lot of time in D.C., and the customers have been excited about it. And have even come down and visited our facilities. Generally very impressed with how we're moving along. Now Shield Capital is a venture capital firm. They raised $125 million. We're the largest strategic partner. And the thought process there was trying to find a way to get these new startup technology companies, which I differentiate from small businesses. Small businesses as a compliance -- contractual compliance and usually applies to service contracts. These are mainly Silicon Valley high-tech startup companies who have great commercial technologies that want to support the Department of Defense. And it's hard for these companies to get programs of record. So we're embracing and working with them.  So we will make investments, either co-invest or through Shield in these companies, which is secondary to the goal of making this strategic investment in that to get this technology into our systems quicker, faster, more affordable and meet the war fighter need. So very excited about that. And we'll keep you updated as that progresses in the years ahead.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nSheila Kahyaoglu : Good morning, Chris, Michelle and team. Thanks so much for the bold new efficient format. I like it. I think Slide 16 or Page 16 is my favorite though. So Chris, since the last time we spoke, there's been a lot of change. The budget came out. It was more robust of an outlook than we thought, coupled with NATO members stepping up defense spending. So given your ability to be perhaps more nimble than others, what are you seeing in terms of incremental opportunities? And how do you think that could impact the intermediate growth profile of LHX?\nChris Kubasik : Okay. Well, thanks, Sheila. We'll obviously welcome all feedback on the new investor letter, but I think we got a lot of positive feedback, giving you 15 hours to read it instead of one hour. So hopefully, that was helpful. Yeah, on Ukraine -- and I'll just say Ukraine in the whole region. The breaking news yesterday was you saw the White House asked Congress for an additional $33 billion of funding. And when you look into the details, which I know will evolve over time, $20 billion is for defense. And of that, $6 billion is the US AI, which is the Ukraine security assistance initiative and $6 billion is FMS.  And those are two vehicles and processes that we're very familiar with, and we've used over the last several years or decades in supporting Ukraine. So I think we understand how that process works, which, of course, is very important. The $6 billion compares to $300 million last year. So this is a significant increase, and we just need to see how long it's going to take to get this bill passed.  As we read it, it appears to have a lot more flexibility for acting quickly to get these contracts moving. So as you would imagine, we're in discussion with several customers in the region and here in the U.S. There's lots of opportunities for L3Harris. When you think of secured communications, I think it's been pretty well publicize the importance of having secured communications. And that's worked well.  With Ukraine, has been a longtime customer of ours. I think you can read and see that the Russians are having difficulty with the communication. So I think that positions us well. We have just, under the whole ISR, situational awareness, whether it's space ISR, air ISR, even the EO/IR turrets out of WESCAM are examples of things that I think could be needed and of course, night vision goggles. So we're really not able to give a lot of details, as you would imagine. But I think broadly, we're well situated. And many of these capabilities are in our sweet spot, even including EW electronic warfare. So I think over the midterm, we continue to believe low to mid-single digits is the right guide at this point in time. We are starting to get demand signals. We're responding to RFIs. But I do like the tailwinds. And I think more to come over the next several quarters. I will say relative to being more agile or nimbler, I can't give you the specifics, but I can tell you within 15 days from receiving a request, we were able to ship product to help with the conflict. And just so you know a lot of this is reprioritization, right? So we have other customers who are willing to give up their products, to get them over in the region. And then we have to obviously backfill those as well. So I don't know if that got to all your point, Sheila, but that's -- I think we're well situated.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Stallard : Thanks so much. Good morning.\nChris Kubasik : Good morning\nRobert Stallard : Chris, I'd reiterate the -- thanks for this new format and the timing especially is very helpful. In terms of my question, inflation obviously is a big issue across the world at the moment. And in relation to defense, there's obviously been some concern about how this could flow through on fixed price contracts. So I was wondering if you could comment on that and what sort of alleviation L3Harris might have to this issue.\nChris Kubasik : Okay. Thank you. No, inflation is a challenge for all of us, and I think all industries. And I think a lot of people immediately jumped to the traditional supply chain and materials, which obviously gets the attention, but I also believe and we're planning for wage and labor inflation as well as the job market gets tighter. So I think we look at it more broadly. When I look at our backlog and our portfolio, we have about 25% of our contracts are cost-plus cost reimbursable. So the way those are designed, the added cost to flow through to our end user. And I think that's one of the reasons you see the budget increased, although I don't think anyone believes it's large enough to absorb all the inflationary headwinds. We have about 25% of our business through the -- not only commercial products, but the commercial business model that we've talked about, whether it's our WESCAM turrets or TACOM radios and such. So similar to other industries at the right time, you increase your prices to take that on. So the real risk if you will, is the 50% that's firm fixed price.  As you know, we don't have a lot of multiyear backlog, but we do have a little over 12 months of backlog. So in that case, it is a headwind.  So in a lot of those contracts, there's escalation clauses. The reality is those indices are probably less than the real inflation, but that does absorb some of headwind. We've talked about E3 and some of the initiatives we're taking there. We've doubled down on that effort, and are going to have to continue to find ways to be more efficient. We're really embracing and rolling out digital engineering. We're investing in more machinery and tooling to be more efficient. So that's going to be the challenge. And then on new bids, which we do several. Michelle and I seems like every day are reviewing another proposal. We have to build those costs into the bids going forward, obviously.  So that's how we address it. And it's given us a little bit of headwind as you see here in the quarter. I don't know, Michelle, if you want to maybe quantify it?\nMichelle Turner : Yeah. So I would just characterize it's very consistent with what we shared in our previous guidance. And the other thing I would say is that from a 2022 perspective, we've locked in most of our supply pricing. So we've mitigated most of the risk consistent with what we put into the guidance.  Although I will say that this environment is becoming more elongated. So as we're thinking about our strategic planning, this is certainly going to be a headwind as we think about 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gautam Khanna with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nGautam Khanna : Good morning, guys. And thank you for the very efficient format both last night and on your opening comments. I had a couple of questions related to one another. So a, if you could just broadly characterize kind of how LHX fared in the fit-up forecast? An open-ended question, if you could talk about radios? You've won a number of IDIQs, night vision, what have you. So take it as far as you'd like, but talk to us about the fit-up and how you guys are positioned?\nChris Kubasik : Okay. Did you have more? Or just -- is that your only question?\nGautam Khanna : Meaning the lives and other questions as well. We can defer that.\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Yeah. I mean, as we saw -- the good news is we did get a '22 budget finally. We've talked at length of challenges. It's taken 165 days to get a budget. But nonetheless, we do get a budget. Now we're starting to see some contracts and activity pick up at a quicker pace. For '23, I think we've all seen just focused on the top-line, the $773 billion top line. In my discussions with several customers and members of Congress, I believe that number is actually going to go up during the conferencing process. I think we've seen about $20 billion on the UP list, the Unfunded Priority list. And I think the majority of that is going to be ultimately rolled into the final 2023 budget. Relative to -- I'll just go to the Unfunded Priority list first. You did mention night vision. That was in the budget as zero. It was zeroed out. But ourselves and our competitor are aggressively working the hill to get that funding back in, with the concurrence of the army. We generally don't go to the hill without our customers' support. So the fact that, that's on the UP list, I think is a positive. So that was probably the one thing that caught our eye on the negative side. But on the positive side, I'll let Michelle talk a little bit about the IDIQ. Everything we looked at seemed to align well with what we wanted. I mean, we track all of our current programs, but we also look at new opportunities. We're very aggressive in bidding opening the aperture and looking for new opportunities. And we like to make sure those opportunities are funded, even though they're competitive, because over the long run, we think we're well positioned to win some of those. The only thing I'd just also throw out beyond DoD is NOAA. I mentioned that we're well positioned with the next-gen weather satellites. The NOAA budget went up 17% \u201823 over \u201822. NASA is up 8%. Even the FAA, where we do a lot of work, is up 4%. So when I look at DoD, Noah, NASA, FAA, and then I think we've all been following the international budgets are trending up, especially in the NATO countries.  I just see this as a lot of positive tailwinds that put us in a good position to continue to grow for the foreseeable future. But maybe I'll give it to Michelle to give a little more color.\nMichelle Turner : Yeah. No, I agree. I think often in recent discussions, our radio business has been overshadowed by our supply chain challenges. But when you look at the predictive indicators, whether we're talking about the budgets with double-digit growth on our handheld or the IDIQs that we received within first quarter. $10 billion of IDIQ is really speak to a predictive indicator on the overall growth within this business. And so we're excited about the near term. Going back to Sheila's question around the immediate opportunities that we're getting from the conflict environment as well, all of the macro indicators would suggest that we're going to have a tailwind related to this business. So we're excited about what's to come. We do need to get through the hurdle, however, with the immediate supply chain challenges\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Arment : Yeah. Good morning, Chris and Michelle. And thanks for your time. And I appreciate the new format like everyone else. I think it's really efficient. Chris, I guess my question is just leaving off from what Michelle just mentioned on the supply chain. Just your comfort level around kind of things improving in the second half? And then also just how it relates to maybe you take a more cautious approach and carry more inventory as we kind of look towards this kind of building budget environment and just kind of have an adjusting case supply versus kind of targeting your working capital days that you been highly focused on? Thanks.\nChris Kubasik: Yeah, thanks. No, that's a great question. Clearly, that's the number one risk that we're all following and have been talking about for at least the last nine months and maybe longer. But to put it in perspective, from last time we had a conversation, I would say it's about the same. It feels like we're making progress. Every day is different. We get two steps forward, one step back. I think the only thing that's changed in my mind maybe the length of the recovery. There's a belief that this was going to all be behind us in 2022. I think it's going to go into 2023.  And again, when I look at supply chain, I put it in three buckets, we have inflation, we have materials and we have labor. I think I've covered the inflation in the prior question. But again, we're kind of in the mid to high-single digit rates, depending on which index you're looking at. And we know it's going to come back down to lower single digits. But I'm thinking that 2023 where previously people might have projected fourth quarter of this year. The materials is mainly the electronic components. We've talked about our investments in a variety of tools, data analytics. And those processes are paying off as we get better visibility. But at the end of the day, the lead times continue to extend, and even the freight and shipping challenges are adding to the complexity, just getting the products into the country and of course, the increased cost of just shipping everything. And labor -- the labor shortage, I think the attrition is up pretty much across our industry. And that's something we've got to figure out how to address. But I think the labor shortage is even more significant within the supply chain. So therein lies the challenge. We've been very successful in our new college grad recruiting. So that's working well from our perspective.  But I'd say feel about same as I did 90 days ago, just a little longer recovery is the way I think I would I would summarize it. I don't know, Michelle, if there's more?\nMichelle Turner : Yeah. So I can add a little bit from a numbers perspective. But I do just because of the complements that we received on the investor letter, I do want to thank Rajeev and the IR team, along with our controller team, communications and legal, a lot of collaborative effort went into creating this. And we feel like it's really a win on many levels. But the one that I would highlight for this group is really how we're living into our DNA of being a trusted disruptor across the organization. So it's not just about our products and technologies, it's about how each and every one of us show up differently to ensure we're a differentiator. So on the supply chain front, just to put some context from a numbers perspective, in first quarter, we expect this is going to be slightly under $100 million in terms of the top-line impact. We expect that that's going to be fairly consistent in Q2, with the recovery happening in the second half and into 2023. And so to Chris' point, I think it's very consistent with what we -- where we were at in January, except with a potential elongation into 2023 as well.  But I do think it's also really important going back to the budget conversation to note that this is all about timing, in particular within tactical radios. The demand for our products remained very strong. So it's really about getting through this short-term lift from a supply chain perspective.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Harned : Good morning. Thank you. I'd like to continue on the tactical radio side. Because when I think of the products that you've got here, I mean, this is sort of the -- I think of it kind of post-jitter's world where you're trying to have common waveforms. So you need a lot of interoperability. So it means you have to -- and my sense is it means you have to really outfit large portions of the military.  And when you think about the IDIQs you've gotten, can you talk about how those -- how you expect those to play out in terms of, in a sense, completing the deployment over time of the radios that the Army, the Marines that they need overtime?  And then second, how do you think about the conversion of those IDIQs into revenues in terms of your share, in terms of the timing of individual awards?\nChris Kubasik : Yeah. No, Doug, great question. Yes. So we can -- let me take the first part, maybe at a higher level, and Michelle can give you some of the actual numbers that show you what we're doing relative to orders and revenue kind of quarter-by-quarter and the outlook So no, look, you're absolutely right on the importance of these radios and the resilient communications. A lot of our R&D goes into new waveforms.  And as we've said before, the modernization is still in the early phases. So we talk about the SOCOM two-channel multiband handheld. That's an almost $400 million IDIQ. It's a little over halfway utilized, which still means there's a couple of hundred million dollars of opportunity. And SOCOM is a great customer, and a lot of our radios start there and then migrate into the other services and even internationally. That was the handheld. They also -- we also have a single -- these are both single awards, which means we get obviously up to the IDIQ ceiling limit, $550 million, for the Manpack. And again, that's about halfway through the spend. So clearly, lots of opportunities in SOCOM. It's 100% LHX. When we go into the -- some of the tactical radios for the Marine, we had a two-channel handheld opportunity there. That was competitive, winner take all. Again, single award, $750 million. That we want. And that's really just getting started. We've had tens of millions of dollars on that so far. I think the ones you read more about and hear about are the dual awards. So if you look at the army rifleman, that's one where we're one of two. And same with the manpack, and again, those were just awarded recently in a recompetition. But those ceiling limits go over a decade, just shy of $4 billion and $12.7 billion.  So the -- step one, as you know, is to win the IDIQ, kind of call that the hunting license. And then you go task order by task order year by year. So we're in really good position. And the modernization will continue secured comps and situational awareness are two key things you need in any conflict. Before handing to Michelle, I will point out, notwithstanding some of the headwinds and volatility in our tactical comm revenue. We still have not missed a customer delivery. So the team is doing a great job every day, different parts come in, get deferred, make sure a challenge.  I will point out, we did increase our inventory about $30 million just in TACOM as we are trying to get more and more of the electronic components in sooner rather than later. But as you know, the lead times are now 6 to 12 months, much more than they used to be. So Michelle, you want to give more color?\nMichelle Turner : Yeah. And just to put some context around the inventory builds. We did build inventory across the enterprise by about $100 million, what we call smart inventory, in terms of solidifying the second half revenue growth. So I think that's a good callout, Chris. But on the IDIQs, we did have 4 substantial IDIQs from outland radio perspective within first quarter. The first one, a $6 billion 10-year dual source IDIQ. So to Chris' point, based on history and how that plays out, we would expect to get half of that in terms of as the funding comes in.  And just a reminder, in terms of how we do our backlog? Our backlog does not assume these IDIQs until they're funded. And so part of what we saw play out within Q1 on the book-to-bill being right around one, did not include any of the funding upside that we would anticipate as we add -- as funding is added to these IDIQs. And then just a couple of other notes. We did book a $3.7 billion from a five-year navy multiservice. This is a sole-source IDIQ. So that would be 100% coming to L3Harris. Similarly, a $750 million 10-year award with Marine Corps. That was a competitive award. And then the final one was a $300 million SOCOM award, another sole source. So of the 4 booked, all were sole sourced, except for the first one, which was dual-source. So again, continue to have really strong predictive indicators in terms of our demand for radios.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRichard Safran : Chris, Michelle. Good morning. So I wanted to ask you, you've been talking about the bookings. Book-to-bill was about one in the quarter. Your comments about continuing to grow. It just seems an understatement to say you're optimistic about demand, given the global increases in defense spending and the upward trajectory of new awards. So what does it say about book-to-bill for the -- how book-to-bill for '22 ends up? I mean, are we talking about an improving outlook here? Do you see international as a bigger driver of your bookings now? And I guess if you could offer a comment on maybe how you're thinking about now what '23 bookings might look like? Anything you could offer there, I think, would be helpful.\nChris Kubasik : Okay. Well, good morning. Richard, it's always good to hear from you. Yeah. We -- the first quarter was 0.98 book-to-bill, and that's really funded book-to-bill as Michelle explained. So maybe a little more conservative than the way others look at it. Look, we've got a plan of about 105 book-to-bill. So we're looking at being over 1 each of the next three quarters. We might be a tad on the conservative side, but we did have a CR through mid-March. And now we have to actually convert these into actual contracts. So that's the process we're going through.  I see international as a tailwind as well. We have some great opportunities for international ISR. We have our EO/IR turrets. And we just have to go through the process. We have congressional notifications and dealing with foreign governments and their approval process. So we think we're in a good position. A lot of these are sole sourced that we're just going through the contracting and export and approval process. And I would expect those to close as planned.  So hopefully, over in the 105 range for this year. We haven't given a lot of insight into '23, but we kind of use that as probably a benchmark for '23 as well because I keep -- we keep talking about the tailwinds each and every day. There's -- everything seems to be positive relative to the demand signals that we're getting. We just have to win and then move forward. In fact, we we're going to be announcing, but the navy announced something that we're quite excited about. That was a recent award known as Spear, which is the shipboard panoramic electro optical infrared system. And why I want to bring this up is it aligns perfectly with our strategy, which is to invest upfront in R&D, prime, more opportunities and then embrace new entrants or flip the paradigm and have some of the more legacy primes on our team. So we'll get a press release out on this one shortly, but it's $200 million EMD opportunity and just under $600 million with options. And that's just for 21 ships for the U.S. Navy. We believe it could be upwards of 100 ships. And of course, we have the international market. So it's a competitive win. We started this actually six years ago by investing our IR&D or R&D on passive target different businesses within L3Harris working together collaboratively. This is a multibillion-dollar opportunity that we're really excited about. And it provides 360 EOIR passive detection and tracking, which is what our Navy needs. If you want to put it under the JAV [ph] C2 umbrella or whatever, this is a big deal. It's modular, it's open systems, and it's something you'll see more in the days ahead.  And then we're waiting for award on something called Spectral with the navy, which is the next-gen sign information operations and the electronic attack solutions. So all these things -- and that has at least four bidders, but we're going after these things. And it aligns with our strategy, and these will start to give us more tailwind and confidence in our growth profile.\nMichelle Turner : Yeah. And just to add a couple of additional words to that because this is part of our second half growth. We are anticipating international ISR missionization programs in the second half as well. And so specifically to the question on international, we did land within Q1 with a book-to-bill over 1 is 1.08 from an international perspective with 4% growth. And so I think that speaks to the -- another predictive indicator in terms of our strategy is working. And then on the space side, clearly continues to be a growth engine for us. We are anticipating the announcement of award on SCCA tracking Tranche 1 as well. And so that's another competitive award that we're anticipating in the second half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Strauss : Thanks. Good morning. \nChris Kubasik : Good morning, David.\nDavid Strauss : Good morning, Chris, Michelle. Mix, I wanted to touch on it. I think it was -- it sounds like it was a benefit to IMS in the quarter, but a negative on SAS. And I think for the full year, it's supposed to be a headwind to both of those segments. So if you could just touch on kind of the big moving pieces when we think about the mix and the impact on margins?  And could you also just touch on the size within -- I think it's within IMS now? Commercial aviation, how big that business actually is now given you've sold off a decent chunk of it? And where that, I guess, that stands relative to like-for-like pre-pandemic levels? Thanks.\nMichelle Turner : Yeah. David so I'll start, and then Chris can jump in. From an overall mix perspective, to your point, our segment margins came in at 16%. You'll know that our guide is 16% to 16.25%. So we came in on the low end of that. But to your point, there was certainly some mix variation when you looked across our segments. So I'll start with IMS. They had a really strong quarter, landing at 14.8%, and comparative to our guide of 13.5 to 13.75, really strong execution. So big complement to look at our ISR team but also overall program mix within our commercial aviation business.  So compliments to Alan and his team as well. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth within our commercial aviation sector, and we're expecting that to continue to grow in the second half as well. And so really strong EAC performance. We do expect that to modulate a bit as we get into second half to align with the guide that we provided. And then to your point, the opposite dynamic is actually playing out within SAS. So we landed Q1 at 11.9 versus a guide of 12.5 to 12.75, which implies that there is going to be increased expectations from a productivity perspective and mix.  Now we did have a really strong quarter from a space perspective within SAS. That's a lower-margin business for us with a lot of the new program wins within it. So we expect that, coupled with our E3 savings, to help that business in the second half of the year. And then finally, from a CS perspective, we talked a lot about supply chain today, but that was clearly a headwind within Q1. We do expect with the volume recovery in the second half that they're going to be able to get to the overall guide of 24.25% to 24.50%.\nChris Kubasik : Yeah. And just to -- on the Commercial Aviation, we're right about $500 million of revenue this year is the outlook, pre-pandemic that was in the $900 million range for our commercial training business. So we're continuing to be patient and take advantage of the rebound, which should be coming soon. We had previously divested the military training, so 900 to 500 there. And I'll just foot stomp, the space business is really doing well, well over $2 billion of revenue, double-digit growth. And I just think we're in the sweet spot, whether it's prime in these responsive space opportunities, such as SDA and HBTSS that we've talked about, some classified opportunities, GPS and the MTS3, which is the next generation of GPS, the weather satellites I mentioned, but also the exquisite satellites, where we are a sub to other companies and provide our payload.  So we're going to take this work each and every time. Might be a little headwind on the margins, but it positions us long term for growth and follow-on opportunities.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Michael Ciarmoli of Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Ciarmoli : Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking question. Love the new format. Chris, just -- and maybe, Michelle, back to the international in the demand environment. I guess if we look at the growth trajectory really in the industry prewar, it was really going to be driven by U.S. DoD modernization next-generation programs in this R&D phase shifting to production. But I guess given what we're seeing with NATO and the increases in their spending plans as a percent of GDP, are you guys seeing more tangible evidence?  And you pointed out that 1.08 book-to-bill that there could be an increase for higher-margin legacy systems as you go forward. And that could potentially provide some structural margin tailwinds as you move into kind of this medium term if these European NATO countries really need to recapitalize their business or their industrial base rather?\nChris Kubasik : Yeah. Michael, that's a great question on the legacy systems. I think we're all learning if the system is out of production now, I think it's almost impossible to restart some of these weapon systems that you read and hear about having been in production for a decade.  So being able to restart something, I think, is difficult. It's something that's currently operational, but maybe an older version or something, I think those are going to be easier to deploy. Again, with the supply chain headwind, I think that is going to be the challenge. I don't think anyone in the industry has a lot of these products lying around in their warehouses. We look for demand signals and contracts.  Now what we're seeing is the customer who's been depleting their inventory. So we're more in a restocking situation. So look, I'm real optimistic about our international opportunities. I think we are unique relative to other companies because we have a combination of products and we use a global distribution network. And then we have our more traditional business development staff with in country executives, in-focused countries, about 10 focus countries. We're focused where we think these opportunities for growth are. So I'm increasingly optimistic about what we've done in international. It's a larger percentage of our company each and every quarter. I think this quarter, maybe in the 23% range.  So more to come. And now that COVID is easing, a lot of us are going to be traveling around the globe more and more to continue to build these relationships and try to close deals. So with that, let me just say, first of all, I appreciate the feedback on our new format. So I think we're going to do this again and continue to do it, at least for the rest of the year and see if we can come up with something even more creative. I know our customers are under a lot of stress, and we're all working in the industry to support our customers.  I mentioned the Agile Development Group and Shield, but this is a result of listening to our customer and hearing what they want and then taking action. So a lot of this, I have to credit our customers for saying they want new entrants. They want innovation. They want to work with Silicon Valley type companies. So we're trying to adapt to that.  And of course, I have to thank the employees, the dedication, the hard work, the innovative spirit. It's all inspiring. I feel like we've got a lot of momentum, a lot of excitement and really looking forward to wrapping up a solid 2022. I will just say in closing that we'll continue our humanitarian efforts for the people Ukraine. We'll keep working with DoD, NATO allies and others to support this mission and deal with the conflict at hand. So thank you for joining the call, and we'll wrap up a little earlier than normal. Have a great weekend. And talk to you in a couple of months. Bye.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. And have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Kubasik",
            "content": "Okay. Well, thank you, Rajeev, and good morning, everyone. As you saw, we released our results after the market closed yesterday in our new streamlined format. We're always looking at ways to improve and challenge the status quo. So instead of issuing a press release at 7:30 this morning, and have Michelle and I read prepared remarks, which were very similar to the press release and maybe with some added color, and then having you follow along with our web charts, which are just a graphic depiction of what we were going to say anyway. We thought we'd try something new and come out with what we're calling our investor letter and putting everything in one document.  And that allows us all the time today to focus on the questions and talk about what's on your mind. So just real quickly, the first quarter results are consistent with our prior commentary of a back half 2022 weighted revenue and margin plan. This will also be the case with our free cash flow as well. And for the full year, we're reiterating our guide across the board as we continue to advance our strategy in a dynamic environment, whether it's from the pandemic or the global threats in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. So before opening the line to questions, I'd like to express our steadfast support the people of Ukraine. I think we all agree their unwavering strength and resilience are a motivating force behind our mission here at L3Harris. So with that, Rob, let's open the lines for questions. Okay. Why don't I take F-35 first, and then I'll ask Michelle to give you some of the financial numbers on F-35, then I'll come back and do ADG and Shield. So yeah, we talk about F-35 each quarter appropriately so. And I'll say this last quarter is probably the best quarter we've had in a while. We're progressing through the integration and test, which we all know is the most challenging part of any development program. And the integrated core processor did begin safety of flight testing earlier in March. So that is a good sign and progressing well. I do want to highlight, we do also have the Panoramic Cockpit Display, which just completed its safety of flight. And then the Aircraft Memory System completed its full qualification test. So everything is tracking well to the first flight. We just provide this to Lockheed, and I think in 2023 is going to be the first flight of the aircraft. So all seems to be going well. On the contractual side, we secured a contract for ICP for Lot 16 and for AMS and PCD on Lot 16 and 17. So we're getting to production contracts, and we're going to be ready to hit the ground running as we complete these tests. So as you'd expect, we're investing R&D and capital to continue to support the program and find more efficient ways to meet these commitments.  And I do want to recognize the team because we are working effectively three shifts and weekends. This is the highest priority for everyone. And we've had customer visits and they've been very complementary of the workforce and the progress that we're making.  So Michelle? Yeah. So let me go back to the first question about the Agile Development Group and our investment in Shield. So you've heard us talk about our strategy of being a trusted disruptor investing more in R&D as a percentage of revenue than most trying to prime more contracts and embracing the new entrants that are disrupting the marketplace and the DoD. So we set up the Agile Development Group. It is an entity that had previously existed. So some of this is just kind of branding it and giving it the recognition it deserves. We have a couple of thousand engineers in this group. Their R&D is double digits as a percentage of revenue. And they're really the front end of the business. And they've been working with speed and agility and innovation. Most of the focus has been on modular open systems, which has been embraced by our customer. And it's hard to give examples because a lot of what we're doing is in the classified arena, initially focused on the air domain. We're also doing some interesting development on new and creative weapon systems.  So they're the front end. And as we get these contracts out of development and into production, they'll hand these off to another entity who is world-class at producing them. So I don't think it's the most unique thing in the industry, but it's something we thought made sense. And they're off to a pretty good start I've spent a lot of time in D.C., and the customers have been excited about it. And have even come down and visited our facilities. Generally very impressed with how we're moving along. Now Shield Capital is a venture capital firm. They raised $125 million. We're the largest strategic partner. And the thought process there was trying to find a way to get these new startup technology companies, which I differentiate from small businesses. Small businesses as a compliance -- contractual compliance and usually applies to service contracts. These are mainly Silicon Valley high-tech startup companies who have great commercial technologies that want to support the Department of Defense. And it's hard for these companies to get programs of record. So we're embracing and working with them.  So we will make investments, either co-invest or through Shield in these companies, which is secondary to the goal of making this strategic investment in that to get this technology into our systems quicker, faster, more affordable and meet the war fighter need. So very excited about that. And we'll keep you updated as that progresses in the years ahead. Okay. Well, thanks, Sheila. We'll obviously welcome all feedback on the new investor letter, but I think we got a lot of positive feedback, giving you 15 hours to read it instead of one hour. So hopefully, that was helpful. Yeah, on Ukraine -- and I'll just say Ukraine in the whole region. The breaking news yesterday was you saw the White House asked Congress for an additional $33 billion of funding. And when you look into the details, which I know will evolve over time, $20 billion is for defense. And of that, $6 billion is the US AI, which is the Ukraine security assistance initiative and $6 billion is FMS.  And those are two vehicles and processes that we're very familiar with, and we've used over the last several years or decades in supporting Ukraine. So I think we understand how that process works, which, of course, is very important. The $6 billion compares to $300 million last year. So this is a significant increase, and we just need to see how long it's going to take to get this bill passed.  As we read it, it appears to have a lot more flexibility for acting quickly to get these contracts moving. So as you would imagine, we're in discussion with several customers in the region and here in the U.S. There's lots of opportunities for L3Harris. When you think of secured communications, I think it's been pretty well publicize the importance of having secured communications. And that's worked well.  With Ukraine, has been a longtime customer of ours. I think you can read and see that the Russians are having difficulty with the communication. So I think that positions us well. We have just, under the whole ISR, situational awareness, whether it's space ISR, air ISR, even the EO/IR turrets out of WESCAM are examples of things that I think could be needed and of course, night vision goggles. So we're really not able to give a lot of details, as you would imagine. But I think broadly, we're well situated. And many of these capabilities are in our sweet spot, even including EW electronic warfare. So I think over the midterm, we continue to believe low to mid-single digits is the right guide at this point in time. We are starting to get demand signals. We're responding to RFIs. But I do like the tailwinds. And I think more to come over the next several quarters. I will say relative to being more agile or nimbler, I can't give you the specifics, but I can tell you within 15 days from receiving a request, we were able to ship product to help with the conflict. And just so you know a lot of this is reprioritization, right? So we have other customers who are willing to give up their products, to get them over in the region. And then we have to obviously backfill those as well. So I don't know if that got to all your point, Sheila, but that's -- I think we're well situated. Good morning Okay. Thank you. No, inflation is a challenge for all of us, and I think all industries. And I think a lot of people immediately jumped to the traditional supply chain and materials, which obviously gets the attention, but I also believe and we're planning for wage and labor inflation as well as the job market gets tighter. So I think we look at it more broadly. When I look at our backlog and our portfolio, we have about 25% of our contracts are cost-plus cost reimbursable. So the way those are designed, the added cost to flow through to our end user. And I think that's one of the reasons you see the budget increased, although I don't think anyone believes it's large enough to absorb all the inflationary headwinds. We have about 25% of our business through the -- not only commercial products, but the commercial business model that we've talked about, whether it's our WESCAM turrets or TACOM radios and such. So similar to other industries at the right time, you increase your prices to take that on. So the real risk if you will, is the 50% that's firm fixed price.  As you know, we don't have a lot of multiyear backlog, but we do have a little over 12 months of backlog. So in that case, it is a headwind.  So in a lot of those contracts, there's escalation clauses. The reality is those indices are probably less than the real inflation, but that does absorb some of headwind. We've talked about E3 and some of the initiatives we're taking there. We've doubled down on that effort, and are going to have to continue to find ways to be more efficient. We're really embracing and rolling out digital engineering. We're investing in more machinery and tooling to be more efficient. So that's going to be the challenge. And then on new bids, which we do several. Michelle and I seems like every day are reviewing another proposal. We have to build those costs into the bids going forward, obviously.  So that's how we address it. And it's given us a little bit of headwind as you see here in the quarter. I don't know, Michelle, if you want to maybe quantify it? Okay. Did you have more? Or just -- is that your only question? Okay. Yeah. I mean, as we saw -- the good news is we did get a '22 budget finally. We've talked at length of challenges. It's taken 165 days to get a budget. But nonetheless, we do get a budget. Now we're starting to see some contracts and activity pick up at a quicker pace. For '23, I think we've all seen just focused on the top-line, the $773 billion top line. In my discussions with several customers and members of Congress, I believe that number is actually going to go up during the conferencing process. I think we've seen about $20 billion on the UP list, the Unfunded Priority list. And I think the majority of that is going to be ultimately rolled into the final 2023 budget. Relative to -- I'll just go to the Unfunded Priority list first. You did mention night vision. That was in the budget as zero. It was zeroed out. But ourselves and our competitor are aggressively working the hill to get that funding back in, with the concurrence of the army. We generally don't go to the hill without our customers' support. So the fact that, that's on the UP list, I think is a positive. So that was probably the one thing that caught our eye on the negative side. But on the positive side, I'll let Michelle talk a little bit about the IDIQ. Everything we looked at seemed to align well with what we wanted. I mean, we track all of our current programs, but we also look at new opportunities. We're very aggressive in bidding opening the aperture and looking for new opportunities. And we like to make sure those opportunities are funded, even though they're competitive, because over the long run, we think we're well positioned to win some of those. The only thing I'd just also throw out beyond DoD is NOAA. I mentioned that we're well positioned with the next-gen weather satellites. The NOAA budget went up 17% \u201823 over \u201822. NASA is up 8%. Even the FAA, where we do a lot of work, is up 4%. So when I look at DoD, Noah, NASA, FAA, and then I think we've all been following the international budgets are trending up, especially in the NATO countries.  I just see this as a lot of positive tailwinds that put us in a good position to continue to grow for the foreseeable future. But maybe I'll give it to Michelle to give a little more color. Yeah, thanks. No, that's a great question. Clearly, that's the number one risk that we're all following and have been talking about for at least the last nine months and maybe longer. But to put it in perspective, from last time we had a conversation, I would say it's about the same. It feels like we're making progress. Every day is different. We get two steps forward, one step back. I think the only thing that's changed in my mind maybe the length of the recovery. There's a belief that this was going to all be behind us in 2022. I think it's going to go into 2023.  And again, when I look at supply chain, I put it in three buckets, we have inflation, we have materials and we have labor. I think I've covered the inflation in the prior question. But again, we're kind of in the mid to high-single digit rates, depending on which index you're looking at. And we know it's going to come back down to lower single digits. But I'm thinking that 2023 where previously people might have projected fourth quarter of this year. The materials is mainly the electronic components. We've talked about our investments in a variety of tools, data analytics. And those processes are paying off as we get better visibility. But at the end of the day, the lead times continue to extend, and even the freight and shipping challenges are adding to the complexity, just getting the products into the country and of course, the increased cost of just shipping everything. And labor -- the labor shortage, I think the attrition is up pretty much across our industry. And that's something we've got to figure out how to address. But I think the labor shortage is even more significant within the supply chain. So therein lies the challenge. We've been very successful in our new college grad recruiting. So that's working well from our perspective.  But I'd say feel about same as I did 90 days ago, just a little longer recovery is the way I think I would I would summarize it. I don't know, Michelle, if there's more? Yeah. No, Doug, great question. Yes. So we can -- let me take the first part, maybe at a higher level, and Michelle can give you some of the actual numbers that show you what we're doing relative to orders and revenue kind of quarter-by-quarter and the outlook So no, look, you're absolutely right on the importance of these radios and the resilient communications. A lot of our R&D goes into new waveforms.  And as we've said before, the modernization is still in the early phases. So we talk about the SOCOM two-channel multiband handheld. That's an almost $400 million IDIQ. It's a little over halfway utilized, which still means there's a couple of hundred million dollars of opportunity. And SOCOM is a great customer, and a lot of our radios start there and then migrate into the other services and even internationally. That was the handheld. They also -- we also have a single -- these are both single awards, which means we get obviously up to the IDIQ ceiling limit, $550 million, for the Manpack. And again, that's about halfway through the spend. So clearly, lots of opportunities in SOCOM. It's 100% LHX. When we go into the -- some of the tactical radios for the Marine, we had a two-channel handheld opportunity there. That was competitive, winner take all. Again, single award, $750 million. That we want. And that's really just getting started. We've had tens of millions of dollars on that so far. I think the ones you read more about and hear about are the dual awards. So if you look at the army rifleman, that's one where we're one of two. And same with the manpack, and again, those were just awarded recently in a recompetition. But those ceiling limits go over a decade, just shy of $4 billion and $12.7 billion.  So the -- step one, as you know, is to win the IDIQ, kind of call that the hunting license. And then you go task order by task order year by year. So we're in really good position. And the modernization will continue secured comps and situational awareness are two key things you need in any conflict. Before handing to Michelle, I will point out, notwithstanding some of the headwinds and volatility in our tactical comm revenue. We still have not missed a customer delivery. So the team is doing a great job every day, different parts come in, get deferred, make sure a challenge.  I will point out, we did increase our inventory about $30 million just in TACOM as we are trying to get more and more of the electronic components in sooner rather than later. But as you know, the lead times are now 6 to 12 months, much more than they used to be. So Michelle, you want to give more color? Okay. Well, good morning. Richard, it's always good to hear from you. Yeah. We -- the first quarter was 0.98 book-to-bill, and that's really funded book-to-bill as Michelle explained. So maybe a little more conservative than the way others look at it. Look, we've got a plan of about 105 book-to-bill. So we're looking at being over 1 each of the next three quarters. We might be a tad on the conservative side, but we did have a CR through mid-March. And now we have to actually convert these into actual contracts. So that's the process we're going through.  I see international as a tailwind as well. We have some great opportunities for international ISR. We have our EO/IR turrets. And we just have to go through the process. We have congressional notifications and dealing with foreign governments and their approval process. So we think we're in a good position. A lot of these are sole sourced that we're just going through the contracting and export and approval process. And I would expect those to close as planned.  So hopefully, over in the 105 range for this year. We haven't given a lot of insight into '23, but we kind of use that as probably a benchmark for '23 as well because I keep -- we keep talking about the tailwinds each and every day. There's -- everything seems to be positive relative to the demand signals that we're getting. We just have to win and then move forward. In fact, we we're going to be announcing, but the navy announced something that we're quite excited about. That was a recent award known as Spear, which is the shipboard panoramic electro optical infrared system. And why I want to bring this up is it aligns perfectly with our strategy, which is to invest upfront in R&D, prime, more opportunities and then embrace new entrants or flip the paradigm and have some of the more legacy primes on our team. So we'll get a press release out on this one shortly, but it's $200 million EMD opportunity and just under $600 million with options. And that's just for 21 ships for the U.S. Navy. We believe it could be upwards of 100 ships. And of course, we have the international market. So it's a competitive win. We started this actually six years ago by investing our IR&D or R&D on passive target different businesses within L3Harris working together collaboratively. This is a multibillion-dollar opportunity that we're really excited about. And it provides 360 EOIR passive detection and tracking, which is what our Navy needs. If you want to put it under the JAV [ph] C2 umbrella or whatever, this is a big deal. It's modular, it's open systems, and it's something you'll see more in the days ahead.  And then we're waiting for award on something called Spectral with the navy, which is the next-gen sign information operations and the electronic attack solutions. So all these things -- and that has at least four bidders, but we're going after these things. And it aligns with our strategy, and these will start to give us more tailwind and confidence in our growth profile. Good morning, David. Yeah. And just to -- on the Commercial Aviation, we're right about $500 million of revenue this year is the outlook, pre-pandemic that was in the $900 million range for our commercial training business. So we're continuing to be patient and take advantage of the rebound, which should be coming soon. We had previously divested the military training, so 900 to 500 there. And I'll just foot stomp, the space business is really doing well, well over $2 billion of revenue, double-digit growth. And I just think we're in the sweet spot, whether it's prime in these responsive space opportunities, such as SDA and HBTSS that we've talked about, some classified opportunities, GPS and the MTS3, which is the next generation of GPS, the weather satellites I mentioned, but also the exquisite satellites, where we are a sub to other companies and provide our payload.  So we're going to take this work each and every time. Might be a little headwind on the margins, but it positions us long term for growth and follow-on opportunities. Yeah. Michael, that's a great question on the legacy systems. I think we're all learning if the system is out of production now, I think it's almost impossible to restart some of these weapon systems that you read and hear about having been in production for a decade.  So being able to restart something, I think, is difficult. It's something that's currently operational, but maybe an older version or something, I think those are going to be easier to deploy. Again, with the supply chain headwind, I think that is going to be the challenge. I don't think anyone in the industry has a lot of these products lying around in their warehouses. We look for demand signals and contracts.  Now what we're seeing is the customer who's been depleting their inventory. So we're more in a restocking situation. So look, I'm real optimistic about our international opportunities. I think we are unique relative to other companies because we have a combination of products and we use a global distribution network. And then we have our more traditional business development staff with in country executives, in-focused countries, about 10 focus countries. We're focused where we think these opportunities for growth are. So I'm increasingly optimistic about what we've done in international. It's a larger percentage of our company each and every quarter. I think this quarter, maybe in the 23% range.  So more to come. And now that COVID is easing, a lot of us are going to be traveling around the globe more and more to continue to build these relationships and try to close deals. So with that, let me just say, first of all, I appreciate the feedback on our new format. So I think we're going to do this again and continue to do it, at least for the rest of the year and see if we can come up with something even more creative. I know our customers are under a lot of stress, and we're all working in the industry to support our customers.  I mentioned the Agile Development Group and Shield, but this is a result of listening to our customer and hearing what they want and then taking action. So a lot of this, I have to credit our customers for saying they want new entrants. They want innovation. They want to work with Silicon Valley type companies. So we're trying to adapt to that.  And of course, I have to thank the employees, the dedication, the hard work, the innovative spirit. It's all inspiring. I feel like we've got a lot of momentum, a lot of excitement and really looking forward to wrapping up a solid 2022. I will just say in closing that we'll continue our humanitarian efforts for the people Ukraine. We'll keep working with DoD, NATO allies and others to support this mission and deal with the conflict at hand. So thank you for joining the call, and we'll wrap up a little earlier than normal. Have a great weekend. And talk to you in a couple of months. Bye."

            "name": "Michelle Turner",
            "content": "Yeah. Good morning, Rob. So just to add a little bit of color from a financial perspective. So our overall Mission Avionics sector is going to be down mid-single digits, consistent with what we shared before. The F-35 development is going to be down low-double digits before we get into the ramp from a production perspective. So we anticipate going into next year that we'll be flattish to up a couple of percent. Yeah. So I would just characterize it's very consistent with what we shared in our previous guidance. And the other thing I would say is that from a 2022 perspective, we've locked in most of our supply pricing. So we've mitigated most of the risk consistent with what we put into the guidance.  Although I will say that this environment is becoming more elongated. So as we're thinking about our strategic planning, this is certainly going to be a headwind as we think about 2023. Yeah. No, I agree. I think often in recent discussions, our radio business has been overshadowed by our supply chain challenges. But when you look at the predictive indicators, whether we're talking about the budgets with double-digit growth on our handheld or the IDIQs that we received within first quarter. $10 billion of IDIQ is really speak to a predictive indicator on the overall growth within this business. And so we're excited about the near term. Going back to Sheila's question around the immediate opportunities that we're getting from the conflict environment as well, all of the macro indicators would suggest that we're going to have a tailwind related to this business. So we're excited about what's to come. We do need to get through the hurdle, however, with the immediate supply chain challenges Yeah. So I can add a little bit from a numbers perspective. But I do just because of the complements that we received on the investor letter, I do want to thank Rajeev and the IR team, along with our controller team, communications and legal, a lot of collaborative effort went into creating this. And we feel like it's really a win on many levels. But the one that I would highlight for this group is really how we're living into our DNA of being a trusted disruptor across the organization. So it's not just about our products and technologies, it's about how each and every one of us show up differently to ensure we're a differentiator. So on the supply chain front, just to put some context from a numbers perspective, in first quarter, we expect this is going to be slightly under $100 million in terms of the top-line impact. We expect that that's going to be fairly consistent in Q2, with the recovery happening in the second half and into 2023. And so to Chris' point, I think it's very consistent with what we -- where we were at in January, except with a potential elongation into 2023 as well.  But I do think it's also really important going back to the budget conversation to note that this is all about timing, in particular within tactical radios. The demand for our products remained very strong. So it's really about getting through this short-term lift from a supply chain perspective. Yeah. And just to put some context around the inventory builds. We did build inventory across the enterprise by about $100 million, what we call smart inventory, in terms of solidifying the second half revenue growth. So I think that's a good callout, Chris. But on the IDIQs, we did have 4 substantial IDIQs from outland radio perspective within first quarter. The first one, a $6 billion 10-year dual source IDIQ. So to Chris' point, based on history and how that plays out, we would expect to get half of that in terms of as the funding comes in.  And just a reminder, in terms of how we do our backlog? Our backlog does not assume these IDIQs until they're funded. And so part of what we saw play out within Q1 on the book-to-bill being right around one, did not include any of the funding upside that we would anticipate as we add -- as funding is added to these IDIQs. And then just a couple of other notes. We did book a $3.7 billion from a five-year navy multiservice. This is a sole-source IDIQ. So that would be 100% coming to L3Harris. Similarly, a $750 million 10-year award with Marine Corps. That was a competitive award. And then the final one was a $300 million SOCOM award, another sole source. So of the 4 booked, all were sole sourced, except for the first one, which was dual-source. So again, continue to have really strong predictive indicators in terms of our demand for radios. Yeah. And just to add a couple of additional words to that because this is part of our second half growth. We are anticipating international ISR missionization programs in the second half as well. And so specifically to the question on international, we did land within Q1 with a book-to-bill over 1 is 1.08 from an international perspective with 4% growth. And so I think that speaks to the -- another predictive indicator in terms of our strategy is working. And then on the space side, clearly continues to be a growth engine for us. We are anticipating the announcement of award on SCCA tracking Tranche 1 as well. And so that's another competitive award that we're anticipating in the second half of the year. Yeah. David so I'll start, and then Chris can jump in. From an overall mix perspective, to your point, our segment margins came in at 16%. You'll know that our guide is 16% to 16.25%. So we came in on the low end of that. But to your point, there was certainly some mix variation when you looked across our segments. So I'll start with IMS. They had a really strong quarter, landing at 14.8%, and comparative to our guide of 13.5 to 13.75, really strong execution. So big complement to look at our ISR team but also overall program mix within our commercial aviation business.  So compliments to Alan and his team as well. This is the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth within our commercial aviation sector, and we're expecting that to continue to grow in the second half as well. And so really strong EAC performance. We do expect that to modulate a bit as we get into second half to align with the guide that we provided. And then to your point, the opposite dynamic is actually playing out within SAS. So we landed Q1 at 11.9 versus a guide of 12.5 to 12.75, which implies that there is going to be increased expectations from a productivity perspective and mix.  Now we did have a really strong quarter from a space perspective within SAS. That's a lower-margin business for us with a lot of the new program wins within it. So we expect that, coupled with our E3 savings, to help that business in the second half of the year. And then finally, from a CS perspective, we talked a lot about supply chain today, but that was clearly a headwind within Q1. We do expect with the volume recovery in the second half that they're going to be able to get to the overall guide of 24.25% to 24.50%."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the opening remarks. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mark Kratz, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nMark Kratz: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me this morning are Chris Kubasik, our CEO; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. We've updated our quarterly earnings approach based on feedback and yesterday evening, we published our fourth quarter earnings release detailing our financial results and guidance. We've also provided a supplemental earnings presentation on our website. As a reminder, today's discussion will include certain matters that constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please reference our earnings release and SEC filings. We also discuss non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled to GAAP measures in the earnings release. Specifically, I will note, segment operating income, which excludes items such as impairments to goodwill and other assets reported at the business segment level. I would now like to turn it over to Chris and Ken for some opening remarks.\nChristopher Kubasik: Okay. Thanks, Mark, and welcome, Ken, to your first L3Harris earnings call. We're excited to have you on the team.\nKenneth Bedingfield: Thanks, Chris. I'm excited to be a part of the team.\nChristopher Kubasik: All right. I want to start by thanking our investors and analysts for attending our Investor Day last month. We had a great turnout and appreciate the strong positive feedback from the event. 2023 marked the fourth full year since the merger and served as an inflection point in many respects. We met our financial commitments. We closed our integrating and seeing the benefits of two acquisitions that are focused on national security and aligned with defense spending priorities. We announced the sale of a non-core business further aligning our portfolio and we returned to growth following a few years of macroeconomic disruptions. This past year, we also strengthened our leadership team and Board of Directors adding key talent that will help drive future value for our investors, customers and employees. This year's progress gives us confidence that we have set the foundation to achieve the financial outlook that we laid out at our Investor Day and are reaffirming today with segment level detail. Globally, the threat environment remains elevated emphasizing the importance of our mission. With the national security-focused portfolio, we continue to support the US and its allies providing vital solutions for our customers' most critical missions. Domestically, we await Congress to pass all 12 appropriation bills by the end of April including the pending vote for an $842 billion topline defense budget which has solid support for our programs, most notably, in the areas of space, missiles, intelligence, and resilient communications. In 2023, demand remained strong. We reported a record $23 billion in orders, including key awards for the US Army's Manpack and Leader Radios, Compass Call missionized business jets, and rocket motors for the Army's Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System. The orders we received in 2023 contributed to a record backlog of $33 billion, more than doubled to $16 billion of backlog at the time of the merger. This positive momentum continued into early 2024, underscored by the recent award for 18 satellites from the Space Development Agency for more than $900 million. Internationally, orders were up 24% including tactical radios, VAMPIRE systems for Ukraine, and an international space award that leverages our 55-year trusted heritage to build and deliver advanced payloads for Japan's next-generation weather satellite. We are maintaining our international growth strategy and aim to improve that mix over the medium term. Operationally, our Performance First culture has been a driving factor in meeting our financial commitments, and we are gaining momentum as we focus on profitable growth. We're about six months into the Aerojet Rocketdyne integration and we have captured the $50 million in cost synergies that we were targeting. The team is using the savings to deploy resources from across L3Harris to help improve operational performance and ultimately increase capacity. In our short time owning this business, we are seeing improvements and we are progressing towards returning to contracted production levels. As highlighted at our Investor Day, we are executing on our LHX NeXt initiative aimed at delivering $1 billion in gross cost savings over the next three years. These efficiencies will optimize our infrastructure and leverage our scale, which enables us to achieve margin expansion moving forward. We executed a number of projects included in exiting facility leases to reduce cost and overall square footage. We continue with our ERP consolidation with 10 reporting units being consolidated into one reporting unit earlier this month. And at the program level, our continued focus on program excellence has helped drive better EAC performance. However, we have more work to do in this area. In 2024, we are prioritizing our focus on execution, margin expansions, and growing free cash flow. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate parts of our portfolio against strategic alternatives for non-core assets. It should be clear that we have made significant progress on the journey to transform the company. Our core businesses are aligned with our customers' priorities and provide many levers to enable us to create shareholder value. Ken will discuss our capital deployment strategy in more detail, but it is unchanged from what we discussed at Investor Day. We will invest to grow organically to delever the balance sheet and then to return excess cash to shareholders. Our strategy is backed by our diverse and talented team and we continue to invest in our workforce, both financially and professionally. This gives me confidence that we have the right leaders in place to execute our imperatives and drive long-term shareholder value. With that, let me turn it over to Ken for some financial details including our 2024 guidance.\nKenneth Bedingfield: Thanks and good morning, everyone. It's great to be part of the L3Harris team and working alongside Chris. Over the last six weeks, I've been actively engaged with the team, reviewing the business and our financial plan. I'm all in on our approach and grow more confident with each day. We'll be on the road meeting with investors next week and attending a few conferences during the quarter, so I look forward to re-engaging with you all over the coming months. Let's start with consolidated results, which were all in line with our latest guidance. We reported full-year revenue of $19.4 billion at the high end of our guidance, up 14% year-over-year and 6% organically, which was primarily from growth in our Space and Airborne Systems and Communication Systems segments. We delivered segment operating margin of 14.8%, earnings of $12.36 a share and free cash flow was just over $2 billion. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $5.3 billion, up 17%, largely driven by the Aerojet Rocketdyne and Tactical Data Links acquisitions and continued strong growth in space systems and resilient communications. Fourth quarter segment margin was 15.1%, up 50 basis points from higher volume and favorable product mix, and better program performance, which all resulted in net positive EAC adjustments. The first net positive quarter since mid-2022. Fourth quarter earnings per share grew 2% to $3.35. Let me hit on segment results before turning to 2024 guidance. SAS reported revenue of $6.8 billion for the year, up 7% as we continue to see strong growth in Space, Mission Networks, and Intel & Cyber programs. I've been impressed with what we're doing in Space. To me, this demonstrates how we are thinking differently, responding quickly, making targeted investments, and seeing them pay off and growing in enduring markets. It's exciting to see how much progress we have made in responsive space where we are taking share. Segment operating margin was 11.4% for the year, down 30 basis points, driven by growth in those early phase Space programs. We are now beginning to move into the more mature production phase of these programs as we look to improve margin in 2024. In IMS, revenue was $6.6 billion for the year, which was roughly flat. Segment operating margin was 11.2%, down 180 basis points from program challenges and lower international mix. I've looked at the changes the team has implemented throughout the year to address these operational challenges and believe that the multipronged approach, including leadership changes, training, and maturing programmatic risk management processes will improve the business going forward. We've already seen sequential improvements within the business and expect greater financial stability in 2024. CS revenue was $5.1 billion, up 20% year-over-year, with 12% organic growth. Beyond the acquisition of TDL, revenue growth was driven by higher volume of Tactical Communication equipment. Segment operating margin was 24.2%, flat year-over-year as higher volumes were offset by lower international mix. I will note that CS had a great Q4 with record operating margin since the merger at 26.1%. Lastly, Aerojet Rocketdyne revenue was over $1 billion and operating margin was 11.6% for the post-acquisition period. The new leadership team Aerojet Rocketdyne is working to drive operational improvements to increase throughput of its critical products. Expanding on Chris' comments, early actions the team has taken include investing in critical suppliers, deploying resources to their sites, improving processes, and co-investing in supplier infrastructure. We look forward to sharing more data with you as we progress on these efforts in 2024. Turning now to 2024 guidance, which is consistent with the framework that we presented at Investor Day. We expect $20.7 billion to $21.3 billion in revenue with organic growth in all segments. As you fill out your models, I would note that with strong fourth quarter results at CS and some favorable SAS timing, we expect a slower top line growth rate to start the year. IMS and total company guidance also contemplates the sale of CAS in 2024 with any potential timing impact within the revenue and margin guidance ranges. Consolidated segment operating margin is anticipated to be approximately 15% from efficiencies gained with increased volume, operational improvements and LHX NeXt cost savings. This is partially offset by a full year of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Throughout the year, margins should gain momentum driven by program ramps, international product mix and accelerating LHX NeXt cost savings. We do have two nonoperational headwinds totaling more than $200 million. First is lower pension income, which we anticipate netting to about $300 million this year and second is an anticipated $650 million in interest expense. With taxes and share count, we anticipate non-GAAP EPS to grow to a range of $12.40 to $12.80. We should see it grow ratably across the quarters, ultimately reflecting a sequential build much like we saw in 2023. We closed out 2023 with solid working capital improvement coming down from elevated levels during the pandemic. The team and I are keenly focused on this as we aim to grow free cash flow over the next several years. For 2024, we expect free cash flow of approximately $2.2 billion, up 10%, driven by earnings growth and continued balance sheet efficiency. At a segment level, we expect SAS revenue of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion, with operating margin in the mid to high 11% range. IMS revenue is anticipated to be $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion, with operating margin in the low to mid-11% range, driven by lower-than-historical international mix. We expect CS revenue of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion, with operating margin in the low to mid 24% range. And for Aerojet Rocketdyne, we anticipate revenue of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion and operating margin in the high 11% range. As Chris mentioned, our capital allocation priority remains focused on first, paying down debt to achieve a leverage ratio of less than 3.0 and then a shift to returning all excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. On the dividend, we continue to target a payout ratio of 35% to 40% of free cash flow. For share repurchases, I will note that we returned over $0.5 billion in 2023, we are targeting a similar amount in 2024, and we look to accelerate buyback in '25 and 2026. To close out, one of the reasons I joined L3Harris was my belief that there is tremendous value potential. In my time here, I have gained more confidence that we can deliver on our 2024 and future commitments. With that, let's open the line for questions. Rob?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Deuschle: Hey, good morning.\nChristopher Kubasik: Hey, good morning, Scott.\nScott Deuschle: Chris, can you give us an update on attrition and program performance at IMS? And then for Ken, the IMS margin guide implies '24 segment margins. I think will be down relative to the second half of '23. So like to hear a bit more on the thinking there. And then also for Ken, just maybe you can comment on your philosophy on guidance. And where you sit on the spectrum in terms of viewing guidance as an aspiration and operational plan or closer to a promise? Thank you.\nChristopher Kubasik: All right. Thanks, Scott. Yeah, talking about IMS, if we look at 2023, you'll see that we did improve margins in the second half compared to the first half. And as we've talked about, it is a little bit of a lumpy business based on the timing of aircraft purchases. We laid out at Investor Day that our strategy in the near term here was really to continue to have stability, especially with the program performance and focus on margin improvement. So to answer your question specifically, here in the short-term, we are seeing better program performance and I think that's what gives us confidence and opportunities not only for 2024 but the next several years. The attrition is definitely slowing down. We've been successful in hiring new people, training new employees, and I think that's starting to be reflected in our performance. And equally as important, the suppliers, and maybe more specifically in this case our subcontractors' performance is starting to improve as we got through those macroeconomic disruptions. The bidding rigor is improving, we've lowered the delegations of authority, so more bids are being reviewed. Not only at the segment level but the corporate level and we have at least one instance in the fourth quarter where we no bid a fixed price development program, and I've been talking about this for at least a year and we will continue to no bid programs where the contract type does not appropriate for the risks we're assuming and I said it in December and I'll say it again. I will sacrifice revenue for earnings and cash every day of the year and we will continue to do so until that changes. And of course, we're making structural changes to the business. In the midterm, I see upside to the margins as we're going to grow internationally at IMS. We're looking at about 25% international this year. I see that getting into the 30% range in a couple of years, driven by WESCAM and international business jets. In fact, this quarter already European customer has awarded $300 million award to us for aircraft missionization and that will be accretive to our margins. And then when we, sure, we will talk more about LHX NeXt in the time that remains but I think this segment is clearly ripe for opportunities. We laid out the fact despite all the good work we've done in the last four years, we still have 100 facilities. We still have eight different ERP vendors and we have 24 reporting units. I did mention that 10 of those in my comments were migrated into one. So we're making progress and the team has taken action, takes some investment on our part, but I like the momentum in the path that we're on. So maybe with that, Ken, you want to?\nKenneth Bedingfield: Sure. Thanks for the question, Scott, and I think Chris hit it well. I'll just add a couple of points. One, the guidance for IMS does assume the CAS divestiture during 2024. CAS does have higher average margins than IMS as a segment. So that's a little bit of a headwind at a margin level for IMS. In terms of timing, we did have some large aircraft procurements in the first half of '23. Nothing in the second half of 2023. So that helped the margin pick up a little bit in the second half of '24, as well as solid program performance. We do see again it's stabilizing as we look forward and we look forward to the team delivering on that. And then thirdly, I guess what I would say is the EO product line tends to build throughout the year that, Scott, solid commercial-like margins. And so we'll see that more likely contributing in the second half as well. With respect to the second part of your question on guidance philosophy, I'll just say, look, again, I'm excited to be a part of the team. We've spent a lot of time thinking about kind of where we are and what this business can do. I think we've laid out a guidance that is something that we can meet and work to build to deliver confidence on during the year. And this is something we're putting out there and that's something that we intend to deliver on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDouglas Harned: Good morning and thank you.\nChristopher Kubasik: Hi. Good morning, Doug.\nDouglas Harned: At the investor conference, you talked about looking to 2026 and basically there was a 100 basis point upside guide to each of the segments. But when you look across them, the opportunity there, it can't be uniform. So perhaps you can help us think through when you look at each of the segments where there is opportunity for more? And maybe in some cases, it might be more difficult to get to that number.\nChristopher Kubasik: Yeah, Doug. Let me take that one. Yeah, let me start with where we are on margins. I mean, we have well-documented that our margins have declined in the last couple of years. We acknowledge we have had some performance issues across the portfolio. But I also want to mention that we have consciously made investments in some high-growth programs and businesses, which impacted the margins in the short-term, but we believe create value in the long-term, and I think Space is probably the best example that we keep highlighting in that regard. Investor Day we did step up our cost savings goal to $1 billion gross run-rate savings by the end of '26 that goes across the entire enterprise. We're calling that program LHX NeXt, as you well know. And look, I agree with you that there's differences by segments for a variety of reasons, and we're setting out a framework, three years out. So we put the 100 -- the 100 basis points is kind of the floor. If I go through or maybe in the -- in some form of order relative to the ability to realize the 100 basis points either earlier or exceeded, I'd like to start with Communication Systems. I think we all know that that has a commercial business model and the potential for more international growth. I think those will be key drivers. We run that like a commercial factory where we make the radios. We look at the quality, the cost of poor quality, the real throughput yield. We're making investments in equipment and training that gives us potential upside. And in that regard, pretty much every dollar falls to the bottom line. We're also looking at the models and seeing if we can be more aggressive on increasing our software sales as an example in addition to the hardware. So, CS would probably be at the top of my list. Aerojet Rocketdyne, we've only had it for five months. We're starting to see some improvements. Big, big volume increase, big investment in capacity, and negotiating the new contracts. Maybe I'll just mention now since owning them, we've already turned in 200 proposals for over $13 billion. Of course, we have to win them and negotiate them, but clearly, the demand is outweighing the supply. So feel good about the potential there, and the ability to return to their historical margins or even better. Scott asked about IMS. I think I laid that out. I think there's upside there with the shift to international. Again, we have the WESCAM business that provides designs and builds and delivers turrets or cameras or gimbals, whatever you want to call them. Again, that's a commercial business model which has accretive margins to the business and end of the day, it comes down to stabilizing the volatility and the program performance, and I think with some leadership changes and better negotiations on new contracts, we should be in a better shape there. And then, of course, Space or SAS, it does have the highest mix of cost plus contracts, Doug, as you know. So most of those savings go back to the customer. But again, the investments that we've made to get into some of these new markets, such as Space, will be decreasing or have decreased. So I don't know if that gives you a little more granularity. I think as we get closer to 2026, we'll be able to be more specific, but the 100 basis points is the floor, and that's kind of my order of how I'd put them. I don't know, Ken, if you agree or have different thoughts there.\nKenneth Bedingfield: No, I think you hit it well.\nChristopher Kubasik: All right.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nRonald Epstein: Yeah. Good morning, guys. One of the big focuses at the Investor Day was the Space business. And maybe if you can give us a deeper dive into how that's going, work on the SDA transport and tracking layers, and maybe continued opportunities for growth in that business.\nChristopher Kubasik: Yeah. Space, we keep talking about Space and highlighting. That is kind of the model for our trusted disruptor strategy. So we've one -- we're really just on the tracking for SDA. So we won tranche zero, we won tranche one. And as I mentioned just a couple of weeks ago, we were awarded tranche two. So I think we've gone from four satellites to eight satellites to 18, so and there will be a tranche three and beyond, I would expect. I can tell you that in each of those successive contracts, the margins that we bid and expect have increased, which was part of our strategy. So the team is performing well. We have satellites waiting to be launched. So we're looking at these annuity-long cycle constellations, and we've talked about the missions really migrating from the air domain to the space domain, and I think we're seeing it here. And these satellites will have single-digit useful lives, and they'll need to be repopulated over time. So I kind of look at this as an annuity where in several years, the tranche zero satellites will deorbit and they'll need additional satellites to be launched. So three for three. Quite proud of the team, and I think our customer is obviously pleased with our performance. I did mention we do have a pretty good business in weather satellite, so it was exciting to see us get some international opportunities. You don't necessarily see that all the time in the Space business. So that's some additional growth. And we still provide payloads for exquisite satellites where we're a sub to the primes. Most of those are classified. So pretty good backlog. We also mentioned it at Investor Day. We're investing in building a satellite factory here in Florida and that ground has been broken and we're excited about that. So we'll be able to turn satellites at a pretty quick pace here in the near term.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.\nChristopher Kubasik: Good morning, David .\nDavid Strauss: So, Chris, I guess following up on Ron's question, SAS, I think in '23 you did something like 8% organic growth. It looks like your guidance for this year is only 2% organic growth. So if you could touch on the slowdown there that you're anticipating, I guess, broken out between Space and maybe the Avionics piece of the business. And then could you also touch on the forecast for Aerojet this year? It looks like if you just kind of annualize the run rate of sales, you're not really anticipating any growth at all out of Aerojet this year. Thanks.\nChristopher Kubasik: All right, David. No, good questions. Yeah, so if I look at SAS, we have several sectors there, two of them, relatively large are flat. The air domain that we've talked about is a flat business. It's a good business with good margins. This is where we perform on mission systems for F-35, F-16, F-18, some classified platforms, but a relatively flat market. And as I just mentioned, those missions are migrating into Space in some cases. So that's how we see that playing out. Mission Networks, which does a lot of work for the FAA, is a very solid business. Good margins, but that's traditionally a pretty flat business for the foreseeable future, especially given some of the budget pressures at the FAA. So that's two of our segments or two of our sectors. Space is growing and Intel and Cyber are growing as well. Just as an aside, I mentioned a lot of this -- more of this business is cost plus than most. So as we continue to reduce cost, I think, David, sometimes -- not sometimes, it always does ultimately reduce your revenue a little bit as well. So the good news of taking out costs, you get higher margins. And as continue to say revenue is interesting, but I'll take margins and cash and EBIT every day, and that's a little bit of the headwind. So that's how I see SAS coming out where it does. And second question on Aerojet Rocketdyne, interesting that you say that, because nobody really knows what their 2023 revenue is. We will disclose that in the 10-K, they only reported the first quarter. There were four months that weren't reported, and then we reported the five months. Anyway, when you see those numbers, you will see that we're right around 5% top-line growth, 2024, compared to the pro-former 2023. Aerojet disclosed three months, we disclosed five. The four fell through the cracks just based on how the accounting works. So we'll put that all in there, and you'll see the 5% growth.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe, Chris, just to stay on Aerojet, looks like, I think, you said you got all $50 million of cost synergies achieved. I mean, it sounds like that was a lot of low-hanging fruit, public company cost. Is there more there? I mean, is that layered into the next initiative? And then I guess just on NeXt, what flowed through in the quarter? I mean, we saw the $47 million in cost. What did you net out in savings? I think the goal was $175 million for the year. And does one segment maybe benefit disproportionately as you progress through NeXt?\nChristopher Kubasik: Yeah, I'll take the first part. Ask Ken to chime in on the second part. Yeah, the $50 million, we did go quickly to realize it. It obviously was a little more lower-hanging fruit than not, but it still takes a lot of time and effort, and we execute it, and we absolutely expect to get a little more out relative to what I'd call the integration. I mean, there's more work to do on the IT systems and tools. We have already aligned them on policies and procedures. All the personnel are already on our payroll systems, our benefit plans, and that type of stuff. So, yeah, we think there's probably an additional $20 million or $30 million that we can get that I would call integration. That will just roll into LHX NeXt. But Ken?\nKenneth Bedingfield: Yeah. No, I agree on that front. I would say the team did a great job of working aggressively to get on top of the initial integration cost savings. We did hit that target. We're continuing to drive for more, but at this point, the primary focus is really around some of the operational efficiencies working to drive the throughput through the business and getting what were some bottlenecks to increased production out of the way so that we can deliver these critical capabilities to our customers at Aerojet. So, great work by the team, certainly continues. And as Chris mentioned, we'll continue to drive opportunity for further, not only integration, but I would say at this point, more importantly, operational efficiencies, again, to drive volume. In terms of LHX NeXt, what I would say is we are very consistent at this point with what we discussed at Investor Day, the gross run rate of a $1 billion savings. We talked about, to your question, $175 million of margin improvement exiting 2024. And I think we see that across the business. I don't necessarily see any individual sector that will benefit first from that. I think Chris talked about the margin opportunity at the sectors through 2026 in getting to our 16% margin framework, but in terms of LHX NeXt, a lot of confidence in the program, confidence in the team. We had set an initial target out there. As we started to work through it, we saw the ability to drive further savings out of that. I've got confidence that we're working to drive at least to that level of savings. And I think, again, all of the segments should see the benefit of that here in 2024.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Arment: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, Chris and Ken. And welcome, Ken. Hey, Ken, maybe just on guidance, if there is, could you maybe level set us just on cadence if first half versus second half, anything to really call out? And then also it was highlighted at the Investor Day that working capital would certainly be positive contributor in cash over the kind of the guidance period. How are you thinking and seeing any opportunities from a working capital perspective, and maybe just working capital profile going forward? Thanks.\nKenneth Bedingfield: Sure. Thanks, Peter. I appreciate the question. Yeah, in terms of cadence, I would say as we look at the -- as we look at 2024, we think the revenue growth itself should be relatively steady throughout the year, probably a relatively even split 50-50 between the first half and the second half in terms of the growth from 2023, quarter-by-quarter, probably a little more of an accelerated ramp on the revenue side starting in the second quarter. In terms of EPS, I would say we'll kind of follow the margin trend. Talked about the margins would be a little bit slower in the first half of the year as we saw a strong performance in the fourth quarter, kind of across the board at the segments. And so we expect that to kind of build momentum as we work through the year. That margin momentum should fall through to EPS. And again, we'll probably see that kind of build sequentially, quarter-over-quarter through the year over 2023. And then from a free cash flow perspective, and on the working capital question, I would say the free cash flow profile will continue to be weighted towards the second half of the year. And on working capital, I think the team did a great job in driving down our working capital at the end of '23, but the work is never done. We'll continue to try to improve that in 2024, but we've got a lot of confidence in our growing free cash flow. We talked about 10% free cash flow growth that will be driven by certainly the margin growth, the margin improvement on growing revenues as well as continued and disciplined balance sheet management.\nChristopher Kubasik: And I'll just chime in, Peter, the continuing resolution. While we've had one every year since 2010, and I think we in the industry know how to deal with it, it does tend to slow things down, really, from a customer perspective. So as I mentioned, we are under a CR through March. Hopefully we'll get a defense budget and eleven other appropriation bills passed so we can get back to normal. But that causes a little bit of the slow start, unfortunately, like it does pretty much every year for the last 13.\nPeter Arment: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Seifman: Hey, thanks very much, and good morning, everyone.\nChristopher Kubasik: Hey, Seth.\nSeth Seifman: I wonder if you could talk in the Communications business where 2023 ended up on tactical radio sales and what you expect in 2024 for domestic and international and kind of the trajectory for each of those?\nChristopher Kubasik: Yeah, let me take that. We actually had a pretty -- we had a great year in CS and especially tactical radios specifically. The interesting thing here, as we talk about the margins, is really the mix between the DoD and the International. So when I looked at the first two quarters, we were heavily weighted towards International versus domestic and then it flipped again in Q3, Q4. And we'll start 2024 with a little more domestic deliveries than commercial, and then it flips in the back half. So we had a record year when it came to revenue in TCOM. I think the business is really coming together quite nicely. We've overcome most of the supply chain challenges. I know when we talked in the past, we literally had hundreds of key suppliers that we were tracking. Now we're down to just a handful. So the results are getting better. We're getting dual sources. And in fact, we've recently had some wins in some new markets that we've been informed of. We're not authorized to disclose them quite yet, but there's a lot of good news coming out of TCOM.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Spingarn: Good morning, Chris. Welcome, Ken.\nChristopher Kubasik: Good morning.\nKenneth Bedingfield: Thanks, Rob.\nRobert Spingarn: So Chris, Ken touched on this, but maybe a quick operational update on Aerojet, but more in the context of some of these supply chain bottlenecks that are still there. Now obviously, this started well before your acquisition and part of the value proposition there is getting it back on pace, but a couple of things. Does it make any sense to bring any of the problem suppliers in-house? And then Lockheed's talking about standing up a third supplier, Anduril is building a business. So I wanted to see how you think about the longer-term market share implications if others come in.\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. Thanks, Rob. Let me start -- cover a couple of things and work in specifically your question. The demand, I mentioned earlier, there's more demand than there is supply, which is a great thing when we look back on the acquisition. And to repeat myself, 200 proposals for $13 billion is something we would have never expected in just a six-month period. The infrastructure, great progress. We've got the $50 million. We've got the policies. We've got the personnel. The IT systems are in work. And in fact on the talent front, the attrition at Aerojet Rocketdyne has dropped by 1/3 overall and 50% for the engineers. We do these regular surveys. There's just a lot of enthusiasm and excitement about the acquisition, the strategy. And I think it's a tribute to the team that shows how we successfully have integrated them and welcomed them into L3Harris. Going back to the demand, it's all about capacity. We've talked about the DPA investment for $216 million focused on GMLRS and Javelin and Stinger. In fact, we've already acquired a building in Huntsville, Alabama. Our capacity and footprint there is 4x and that will ultimately -- it is, but it will ultimately be our inert center of excellence, which is great. The challenges are really at the sub-tier suppliers, as you said. I don't think it makes a lot of sense to bring them in-house. We've actually invested in some of these, not as an ownership, but by helping them with tooling and capital. Our customers have also -- our end customer and our immediate prime customers have also invested. So as we've said, there's a little bit of a chokepoint here at the sub-tier. Personally, I think over time, a third solid rocket motor provider is fine. We don't shy away from competition. But that doesn't really solve the problem because at the end of the day, everybody's going to be going to the same sub-tiers, for the cases, for the igniters, for the nozzles and such. So we have to fix the sub-tier. We're doing our part by helping them out financially, getting the equipment, improving their -- the capacity. And we started to see it. There is a big well documented, I think, we call it backlog or undelivered motors, and we're chipping away at that, as I mentioned. And once we get these facilities and equipment up and running, I think it's going to look pretty good. And, yes, there's a lot of people trying to get into this market now, which is fine. It's a high-growth market, and in my mind, reaffirms the rationale and the value potential from this acquisition.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nMyles Walton: Ken, I'm hoping you can provide a few of the cash details on the surface, the Section 174 impact for '23 and '24, maybe what the benefit would be if they retroactively reversed it, what you've paid and what you could get back. And then maybe just also as it relates to stripping out from the cash numbers, is it just the $220 million for LHX NeXt that you laid out at Investor Day? Or are there other adjustments we should consider? Thanks.\nKenneth Bedingfield: Thanks, Myles. Let me -- I'll talk about 174 a little bit first and then get into the second part of the question. So let me just start by saying we've got a great tax team that works really hard every day to drive value for the business. And one of the things that I think they do well and we do well in supporting them is getting them really integrated with the businesses so that we get all the data, we get all the information needed to support our R&D deductions and credits. We work very closely with the IRS team to validate what we've got and what we're doing and how all that works. And I think we've done a great job. This is a business that invests heavily in R&D to drive future capability and future growth, and we'll continue to do that, and we'll continue to see that benefit. In terms of the cash profile, what I'll say is that, in '23, we're able to catch up a little bit on some tax payments from a timing perspective. In terms of the new amortization of Section 174, we're able to kind of catch back up to being current through the end of '23 on the impact -- the cash impact of that. And then in terms of the new legislation that's working through, I'll say we're tracking that carefully, keeping an eye on it. The impact of that, if it is passed into law, would be positive for us from a cash perspective. And I don't want to put a number on it, but as currently drafted, would have some retroactive impact for, I believe, it's '22 and '23. So positive on cash. And then I think there would ultimately be a little bit of a rate headwind as we look forward. But I would say we'd be very willing to trade that little bit of rate benefit for the cash benefit that we see. And then in terms of kind of free cash flow guide for 2024 and the adjustments. At this point in time, what we're looking at in terms of what that would be adjusted for would largely be the LHX NeXt onetime implementation cost. To your question, I think that should be the largest item there.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Chris and Ken.\nChristopher Kubasik: Hi, Sheila.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Chris, One for you, please. You mentioned international mix within IMS. More broadly, what are you seeing in the international pipeline? And how are you thinking about the timing of that conversion? And just thinking about the overall 3% organic growth guidance for '24, how does internal track relative to domestic, and what are the broader margin implications?\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. Thanks for the question. I mean, obviously, the broader margin implication is we tend to have higher margins in international than domestic, just like we do with commercial. So I see an increase -- slight increase year-over-year. We're kind of hanging around the 22%, 23% of our revenue comes from international, maybe a little uptick in '24, '25 and '26. But every point helps. I think it comes down to this -- the one that's going to move the needle a little bit is going to be the supplementals. And we haven't talked a whole lot about DC in the budget. But there is a supplemental out there for Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel put out last year for $110 billion. I think about $58 billion is targeted for the DoD. It's all tied up in politics as it relates to border security. But I think at the end of the day, we need to get these things passed because it's really just backfilling the stockpile that we've already given into several of the countries I mentioned. So hopefully, we get that behind us, and that will solidify our growth opportunities in those regions specifically. So as I look at each of the segments. Aerojet, as you know, most of that goes through a couple of primes. So we actually don't have any international revenue the way we disclose it for Aerojet, notwithstanding that several of these products get deployed from -- but from our perspective, we just sell them to two or three primes and then they put them wherever they need to go. So we just call that domestic for what that's worth. IMS, I talked about WESCAM and bizjets, I see upside there. SAS, it's really given the classified nature of so many things they do. We have an occasional space satellite, like I mentioned, in Japan. Some of the avionics stuff goes international as well. And then CS has the highest percentage of international mainly coming out of the tactical radio business. And when I look at what we've done in Ukraine and what's needed in Europe and the Mid-East and the Far East, it's looking rather positive. So I hope that help, Sheila.\nMark Kratz: Rob, we're coming up on the hour, so maybe we'll take our last question this morning.\nOperator: Sure. Our last question comes from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nChristopher Kubasik: Good morning.\nKenneth Bedingfield: Hey, Rob.\nRobert Stallard: And welcome back, Ken.\nKenneth Bedingfield: Thank you.\nRobert Stallard: Chris, probably a question for you. Your counterpart at Lockheed Martin, Jim Taiclet was kind of talking about structural problems in the defense industry with regard to pricing and contracting and whether that could change in the future. I was wondering if you have any issues lingering in the L3Harris portfolio that maybe fits that criteria. But on the flip side, do you see the opportunity to grow more sort of commercial terms contracts in the future?\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. Good question, Robert. Look, we've all been in this industry for decades, and it kind of goes in cycles where everybody thought fixed-price development programs was a good idea in the '70s and '80s, and then it migrates back to cost-plus and goes the other way. Just kind of have to understand where the customer is and figure out where they're going. There's lots of opportunities to interface with them. We're we've been successful with our commercial business models that I've mentioned. I think there's more that we can look at in that regard. I think more and more things are moving towards software, and I think it's a new area. I think the DoD has to figure out how to buy software and we have to figure out how to sell software. There have been some cases where it's done. But again, that's probably a different business model than your traditional cost-plus, truth in negotiation type regulations may not make sense. And I think that's what a lot of the new entrants are also struggling with, to figure out how to get into those markets. So look, we all get to draft RFPs. We review them, we push back and sometimes you just have to no-bid. And one of these days, the entire industry is not going to bid on a fixed-price development contract and the DoD will change. But when you get one or two bids, they're going to make the award, and we're doing our best to balance the risk with the financial upside that we have, so probably a little more disciplined. But this has been an ongoing debate probably for decades, and we continue to engage with the customer, and I think they appreciate and understand where the industry is coming from. So we'll see what happens in the months and years ahead.\nChristopher Kubasik: So look, before I sign off, I really would like to take a moment and thank our 50,000 employees for their focus on performance and execution throughout the year. Clearly, this is impossible without them, and they're critical to our success in meeting not only our shareholders, but our customer commitments. So really appreciate everybody joining the call. Ken, again, welcome to the team. And we'll be talking to you all soon. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Kenneth Bedingfield",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. I'm excited to be a part of the team. Thanks and good morning, everyone. It's great to be part of the L3Harris team and working alongside Chris. Over the last six weeks, I've been actively engaged with the team, reviewing the business and our financial plan. I'm all in on our approach and grow more confident with each day. We'll be on the road meeting with investors next week and attending a few conferences during the quarter, so I look forward to re-engaging with you all over the coming months. Let's start with consolidated results, which were all in line with our latest guidance. We reported full-year revenue of $19.4 billion at the high end of our guidance, up 14% year-over-year and 6% organically, which was primarily from growth in our Space and Airborne Systems and Communication Systems segments. We delivered segment operating margin of 14.8%, earnings of $12.36 a share and free cash flow was just over $2 billion. For the fourth quarter, revenue was $5.3 billion, up 17%, largely driven by the Aerojet Rocketdyne and Tactical Data Links acquisitions and continued strong growth in space systems and resilient communications. Fourth quarter segment margin was 15.1%, up 50 basis points from higher volume and favorable product mix, and better program performance, which all resulted in net positive EAC adjustments. The first net positive quarter since mid-2022. Fourth quarter earnings per share grew 2% to $3.35. Let me hit on segment results before turning to 2024 guidance. SAS reported revenue of $6.8 billion for the year, up 7% as we continue to see strong growth in Space, Mission Networks, and Intel & Cyber programs. I've been impressed with what we're doing in Space. To me, this demonstrates how we are thinking differently, responding quickly, making targeted investments, and seeing them pay off and growing in enduring markets. It's exciting to see how much progress we have made in responsive space where we are taking share. Segment operating margin was 11.4% for the year, down 30 basis points, driven by growth in those early phase Space programs. We are now beginning to move into the more mature production phase of these programs as we look to improve margin in 2024. In IMS, revenue was $6.6 billion for the year, which was roughly flat. Segment operating margin was 11.2%, down 180 basis points from program challenges and lower international mix. I've looked at the changes the team has implemented throughout the year to address these operational challenges and believe that the multipronged approach, including leadership changes, training, and maturing programmatic risk management processes will improve the business going forward. We've already seen sequential improvements within the business and expect greater financial stability in 2024. CS revenue was $5.1 billion, up 20% year-over-year, with 12% organic growth. Beyond the acquisition of TDL, revenue growth was driven by higher volume of Tactical Communication equipment. Segment operating margin was 24.2%, flat year-over-year as higher volumes were offset by lower international mix. I will note that CS had a great Q4 with record operating margin since the merger at 26.1%. Lastly, Aerojet Rocketdyne revenue was over $1 billion and operating margin was 11.6% for the post-acquisition period. The new leadership team Aerojet Rocketdyne is working to drive operational improvements to increase throughput of its critical products. Expanding on Chris' comments, early actions the team has taken include investing in critical suppliers, deploying resources to their sites, improving processes, and co-investing in supplier infrastructure. We look forward to sharing more data with you as we progress on these efforts in 2024. Turning now to 2024 guidance, which is consistent with the framework that we presented at Investor Day. We expect $20.7 billion to $21.3 billion in revenue with organic growth in all segments. As you fill out your models, I would note that with strong fourth quarter results at CS and some favorable SAS timing, we expect a slower top line growth rate to start the year. IMS and total company guidance also contemplates the sale of CAS in 2024 with any potential timing impact within the revenue and margin guidance ranges. Consolidated segment operating margin is anticipated to be approximately 15% from efficiencies gained with increased volume, operational improvements and LHX NeXt cost savings. This is partially offset by a full year of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Throughout the year, margins should gain momentum driven by program ramps, international product mix and accelerating LHX NeXt cost savings. We do have two nonoperational headwinds totaling more than $200 million. First is lower pension income, which we anticipate netting to about $300 million this year and second is an anticipated $650 million in interest expense. With taxes and share count, we anticipate non-GAAP EPS to grow to a range of $12.40 to $12.80. We should see it grow ratably across the quarters, ultimately reflecting a sequential build much like we saw in 2023. We closed out 2023 with solid working capital improvement coming down from elevated levels during the pandemic. The team and I are keenly focused on this as we aim to grow free cash flow over the next several years. For 2024, we expect free cash flow of approximately $2.2 billion, up 10%, driven by earnings growth and continued balance sheet efficiency. At a segment level, we expect SAS revenue of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion, with operating margin in the mid to high 11% range. IMS revenue is anticipated to be $6.4 billion to $6.6 billion, with operating margin in the low to mid-11% range, driven by lower-than-historical international mix. We expect CS revenue of $5.3 billion to $5.4 billion, with operating margin in the low to mid 24% range. And for Aerojet Rocketdyne, we anticipate revenue of $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion and operating margin in the high 11% range. As Chris mentioned, our capital allocation priority remains focused on first, paying down debt to achieve a leverage ratio of less than 3.0 and then a shift to returning all excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. On the dividend, we continue to target a payout ratio of 35% to 40% of free cash flow. For share repurchases, I will note that we returned over $0.5 billion in 2023, we are targeting a similar amount in 2024, and we look to accelerate buyback in '25 and 2026. To close out, one of the reasons I joined L3Harris was my belief that there is tremendous value potential. In my time here, I have gained more confidence that we can deliver on our 2024 and future commitments. With that, let's open the line for questions. Rob? Sure. Thanks for the question, Scott, and I think Chris hit it well. I'll just add a couple of points. One, the guidance for IMS does assume the CAS divestiture during 2024. CAS does have higher average margins than IMS as a segment. So that's a little bit of a headwind at a margin level for IMS. In terms of timing, we did have some large aircraft procurements in the first half of '23. Nothing in the second half of 2023. So that helped the margin pick up a little bit in the second half of '24, as well as solid program performance. We do see again it's stabilizing as we look forward and we look forward to the team delivering on that. And then thirdly, I guess what I would say is the EO product line tends to build throughout the year that, Scott, solid commercial-like margins. And so we'll see that more likely contributing in the second half as well. With respect to the second part of your question on guidance philosophy, I'll just say, look, again, I'm excited to be a part of the team. We've spent a lot of time thinking about kind of where we are and what this business can do. I think we've laid out a guidance that is something that we can meet and work to build to deliver confidence on during the year. And this is something we're putting out there and that's something that we intend to deliver on. No, I think you hit it well. Yeah. No, I agree on that front. I would say the team did a great job of working aggressively to get on top of the initial integration cost savings. We did hit that target. We're continuing to drive for more, but at this point, the primary focus is really around some of the operational efficiencies working to drive the throughput through the business and getting what were some bottlenecks to increased production out of the way so that we can deliver these critical capabilities to our customers at Aerojet. So, great work by the team, certainly continues. And as Chris mentioned, we'll continue to drive opportunity for further, not only integration, but I would say at this point, more importantly, operational efficiencies, again, to drive volume. In terms of LHX NeXt, what I would say is we are very consistent at this point with what we discussed at Investor Day, the gross run rate of a $1 billion savings. We talked about, to your question, $175 million of margin improvement exiting 2024. And I think we see that across the business. I don't necessarily see any individual sector that will benefit first from that. I think Chris talked about the margin opportunity at the sectors through 2026 in getting to our 16% margin framework, but in terms of LHX NeXt, a lot of confidence in the program, confidence in the team. We had set an initial target out there. As we started to work through it, we saw the ability to drive further savings out of that. I've got confidence that we're working to drive at least to that level of savings. And I think, again, all of the segments should see the benefit of that here in 2024. Sure. Thanks, Peter. I appreciate the question. Yeah, in terms of cadence, I would say as we look at the -- as we look at 2024, we think the revenue growth itself should be relatively steady throughout the year, probably a relatively even split 50-50 between the first half and the second half in terms of the growth from 2023, quarter-by-quarter, probably a little more of an accelerated ramp on the revenue side starting in the second quarter. In terms of EPS, I would say we'll kind of follow the margin trend. Talked about the margins would be a little bit slower in the first half of the year as we saw a strong performance in the fourth quarter, kind of across the board at the segments. And so we expect that to kind of build momentum as we work through the year. That margin momentum should fall through to EPS. And again, we'll probably see that kind of build sequentially, quarter-over-quarter through the year over 2023. And then from a free cash flow perspective, and on the working capital question, I would say the free cash flow profile will continue to be weighted towards the second half of the year. And on working capital, I think the team did a great job in driving down our working capital at the end of '23, but the work is never done. We'll continue to try to improve that in 2024, but we've got a lot of confidence in our growing free cash flow. We talked about 10% free cash flow growth that will be driven by certainly the margin growth, the margin improvement on growing revenues as well as continued and disciplined balance sheet management. Thanks, Rob. Thanks, Myles. Let me -- I'll talk about 174 a little bit first and then get into the second part of the question. So let me just start by saying we've got a great tax team that works really hard every day to drive value for the business. And one of the things that I think they do well and we do well in supporting them is getting them really integrated with the businesses so that we get all the data, we get all the information needed to support our R&D deductions and credits. We work very closely with the IRS team to validate what we've got and what we're doing and how all that works. And I think we've done a great job. This is a business that invests heavily in R&D to drive future capability and future growth, and we'll continue to do that, and we'll continue to see that benefit. In terms of the cash profile, what I'll say is that, in '23, we're able to catch up a little bit on some tax payments from a timing perspective. In terms of the new amortization of Section 174, we're able to kind of catch back up to being current through the end of '23 on the impact -- the cash impact of that. And then in terms of the new legislation that's working through, I'll say we're tracking that carefully, keeping an eye on it. The impact of that, if it is passed into law, would be positive for us from a cash perspective. And I don't want to put a number on it, but as currently drafted, would have some retroactive impact for, I believe, it's '22 and '23. So positive on cash. And then I think there would ultimately be a little bit of a rate headwind as we look forward. But I would say we'd be very willing to trade that little bit of rate benefit for the cash benefit that we see. And then in terms of kind of free cash flow guide for 2024 and the adjustments. At this point in time, what we're looking at in terms of what that would be adjusted for would largely be the LHX NeXt onetime implementation cost. To your question, I think that should be the largest item there. Hey, Rob. Thank you."

            "name": "Christopher Kubasik",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Mark, and welcome, Ken, to your first L3Harris earnings call. We're excited to have you on the team. All right. I want to start by thanking our investors and analysts for attending our Investor Day last month. We had a great turnout and appreciate the strong positive feedback from the event. 2023 marked the fourth full year since the merger and served as an inflection point in many respects. We met our financial commitments. We closed our integrating and seeing the benefits of two acquisitions that are focused on national security and aligned with defense spending priorities. We announced the sale of a non-core business further aligning our portfolio and we returned to growth following a few years of macroeconomic disruptions. This past year, we also strengthened our leadership team and Board of Directors adding key talent that will help drive future value for our investors, customers and employees. This year's progress gives us confidence that we have set the foundation to achieve the financial outlook that we laid out at our Investor Day and are reaffirming today with segment level detail. Globally, the threat environment remains elevated emphasizing the importance of our mission. With the national security-focused portfolio, we continue to support the US and its allies providing vital solutions for our customers' most critical missions. Domestically, we await Congress to pass all 12 appropriation bills by the end of April including the pending vote for an $842 billion topline defense budget which has solid support for our programs, most notably, in the areas of space, missiles, intelligence, and resilient communications. In 2023, demand remained strong. We reported a record $23 billion in orders, including key awards for the US Army's Manpack and Leader Radios, Compass Call missionized business jets, and rocket motors for the Army's Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System. The orders we received in 2023 contributed to a record backlog of $33 billion, more than doubled to $16 billion of backlog at the time of the merger. This positive momentum continued into early 2024, underscored by the recent award for 18 satellites from the Space Development Agency for more than $900 million. Internationally, orders were up 24% including tactical radios, VAMPIRE systems for Ukraine, and an international space award that leverages our 55-year trusted heritage to build and deliver advanced payloads for Japan's next-generation weather satellite. We are maintaining our international growth strategy and aim to improve that mix over the medium term. Operationally, our Performance First culture has been a driving factor in meeting our financial commitments, and we are gaining momentum as we focus on profitable growth. We're about six months into the Aerojet Rocketdyne integration and we have captured the $50 million in cost synergies that we were targeting. The team is using the savings to deploy resources from across L3Harris to help improve operational performance and ultimately increase capacity. In our short time owning this business, we are seeing improvements and we are progressing towards returning to contracted production levels. As highlighted at our Investor Day, we are executing on our LHX NeXt initiative aimed at delivering $1 billion in gross cost savings over the next three years. These efficiencies will optimize our infrastructure and leverage our scale, which enables us to achieve margin expansion moving forward. We executed a number of projects included in exiting facility leases to reduce cost and overall square footage. We continue with our ERP consolidation with 10 reporting units being consolidated into one reporting unit earlier this month. And at the program level, our continued focus on program excellence has helped drive better EAC performance. However, we have more work to do in this area. In 2024, we are prioritizing our focus on execution, margin expansions, and growing free cash flow. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate parts of our portfolio against strategic alternatives for non-core assets. It should be clear that we have made significant progress on the journey to transform the company. Our core businesses are aligned with our customers' priorities and provide many levers to enable us to create shareholder value. Ken will discuss our capital deployment strategy in more detail, but it is unchanged from what we discussed at Investor Day. We will invest to grow organically to delever the balance sheet and then to return excess cash to shareholders. Our strategy is backed by our diverse and talented team and we continue to invest in our workforce, both financially and professionally. This gives me confidence that we have the right leaders in place to execute our imperatives and drive long-term shareholder value. With that, let me turn it over to Ken for some financial details including our 2024 guidance. Hey, good morning, Scott. All right. Thanks, Scott. Yeah, talking about IMS, if we look at 2023, you'll see that we did improve margins in the second half compared to the first half. And as we've talked about, it is a little bit of a lumpy business based on the timing of aircraft purchases. We laid out at Investor Day that our strategy in the near term here was really to continue to have stability, especially with the program performance and focus on margin improvement. So to answer your question specifically, here in the short-term, we are seeing better program performance and I think that's what gives us confidence and opportunities not only for 2024 but the next several years. The attrition is definitely slowing down. We've been successful in hiring new people, training new employees, and I think that's starting to be reflected in our performance. And equally as important, the suppliers, and maybe more specifically in this case our subcontractors' performance is starting to improve as we got through those macroeconomic disruptions. The bidding rigor is improving, we've lowered the delegations of authority, so more bids are being reviewed. Not only at the segment level but the corporate level and we have at least one instance in the fourth quarter where we no bid a fixed price development program, and I've been talking about this for at least a year and we will continue to no bid programs where the contract type does not appropriate for the risks we're assuming and I said it in December and I'll say it again. I will sacrifice revenue for earnings and cash every day of the year and we will continue to do so until that changes. And of course, we're making structural changes to the business. In the midterm, I see upside to the margins as we're going to grow internationally at IMS. We're looking at about 25% international this year. I see that getting into the 30% range in a couple of years, driven by WESCAM and international business jets. In fact, this quarter already European customer has awarded $300 million award to us for aircraft missionization and that will be accretive to our margins. And then when we, sure, we will talk more about LHX NeXt in the time that remains but I think this segment is clearly ripe for opportunities. We laid out the fact despite all the good work we've done in the last four years, we still have 100 facilities. We still have eight different ERP vendors and we have 24 reporting units. I did mention that 10 of those in my comments were migrated into one. So we're making progress and the team has taken action, takes some investment on our part, but I like the momentum in the path that we're on. So maybe with that, Ken, you want to? Hi. Good morning, Doug. Yeah, Doug. Let me take that one. Yeah, let me start with where we are on margins. I mean, we have well-documented that our margins have declined in the last couple of years. We acknowledge we have had some performance issues across the portfolio. But I also want to mention that we have consciously made investments in some high-growth programs and businesses, which impacted the margins in the short-term, but we believe create value in the long-term, and I think Space is probably the best example that we keep highlighting in that regard. Investor Day we did step up our cost savings goal to $1 billion gross run-rate savings by the end of '26 that goes across the entire enterprise. We're calling that program LHX NeXt, as you well know. And look, I agree with you that there's differences by segments for a variety of reasons, and we're setting out a framework, three years out. So we put the 100 -- the 100 basis points is kind of the floor. If I go through or maybe in the -- in some form of order relative to the ability to realize the 100 basis points either earlier or exceeded, I'd like to start with Communication Systems. I think we all know that that has a commercial business model and the potential for more international growth. I think those will be key drivers. We run that like a commercial factory where we make the radios. We look at the quality, the cost of poor quality, the real throughput yield. We're making investments in equipment and training that gives us potential upside. And in that regard, pretty much every dollar falls to the bottom line. We're also looking at the models and seeing if we can be more aggressive on increasing our software sales as an example in addition to the hardware. So, CS would probably be at the top of my list. Aerojet Rocketdyne, we've only had it for five months. We're starting to see some improvements. Big, big volume increase, big investment in capacity, and negotiating the new contracts. Maybe I'll just mention now since owning them, we've already turned in 200 proposals for over $13 billion. Of course, we have to win them and negotiate them, but clearly, the demand is outweighing the supply. So feel good about the potential there, and the ability to return to their historical margins or even better. Scott asked about IMS. I think I laid that out. I think there's upside there with the shift to international. Again, we have the WESCAM business that provides designs and builds and delivers turrets or cameras or gimbals, whatever you want to call them. Again, that's a commercial business model which has accretive margins to the business and end of the day, it comes down to stabilizing the volatility and the program performance, and I think with some leadership changes and better negotiations on new contracts, we should be in a better shape there. And then, of course, Space or SAS, it does have the highest mix of cost plus contracts, Doug, as you know. So most of those savings go back to the customer. But again, the investments that we've made to get into some of these new markets, such as Space, will be decreasing or have decreased. So I don't know if that gives you a little more granularity. I think as we get closer to 2026, we'll be able to be more specific, but the 100 basis points is the floor, and that's kind of my order of how I'd put them. I don't know, Ken, if you agree or have different thoughts there. All right. Yeah. Space, we keep talking about Space and highlighting. That is kind of the model for our trusted disruptor strategy. So we've one -- we're really just on the tracking for SDA. So we won tranche zero, we won tranche one. And as I mentioned just a couple of weeks ago, we were awarded tranche two. So I think we've gone from four satellites to eight satellites to 18, so and there will be a tranche three and beyond, I would expect. I can tell you that in each of those successive contracts, the margins that we bid and expect have increased, which was part of our strategy. So the team is performing well. We have satellites waiting to be launched. So we're looking at these annuity-long cycle constellations, and we've talked about the missions really migrating from the air domain to the space domain, and I think we're seeing it here. And these satellites will have single-digit useful lives, and they'll need to be repopulated over time. So I kind of look at this as an annuity where in several years, the tranche zero satellites will deorbit and they'll need additional satellites to be launched. So three for three. Quite proud of the team, and I think our customer is obviously pleased with our performance. I did mention we do have a pretty good business in weather satellite, so it was exciting to see us get some international opportunities. You don't necessarily see that all the time in the Space business. So that's some additional growth. And we still provide payloads for exquisite satellites where we're a sub to the primes. Most of those are classified. So pretty good backlog. We also mentioned it at Investor Day. We're investing in building a satellite factory here in Florida and that ground has been broken and we're excited about that. So we'll be able to turn satellites at a pretty quick pace here in the near term. Good morning, David . All right, David. No, good questions. Yeah, so if I look at SAS, we have several sectors there, two of them, relatively large are flat. The air domain that we've talked about is a flat business. It's a good business with good margins. This is where we perform on mission systems for F-35, F-16, F-18, some classified platforms, but a relatively flat market. And as I just mentioned, those missions are migrating into Space in some cases. So that's how we see that playing out. Mission Networks, which does a lot of work for the FAA, is a very solid business. Good margins, but that's traditionally a pretty flat business for the foreseeable future, especially given some of the budget pressures at the FAA. So that's two of our segments or two of our sectors. Space is growing and Intel and Cyber are growing as well. Just as an aside, I mentioned a lot of this -- more of this business is cost plus than most. So as we continue to reduce cost, I think, David, sometimes -- not sometimes, it always does ultimately reduce your revenue a little bit as well. So the good news of taking out costs, you get higher margins. And as continue to say revenue is interesting, but I'll take margins and cash and EBIT every day, and that's a little bit of the headwind. So that's how I see SAS coming out where it does. And second question on Aerojet Rocketdyne, interesting that you say that, because nobody really knows what their 2023 revenue is. We will disclose that in the 10-K, they only reported the first quarter. There were four months that weren't reported, and then we reported the five months. Anyway, when you see those numbers, you will see that we're right around 5% top-line growth, 2024, compared to the pro-former 2023. Aerojet disclosed three months, we disclosed five. The four fell through the cracks just based on how the accounting works. So we'll put that all in there, and you'll see the 5% growth. Yeah, I'll take the first part. Ask Ken to chime in on the second part. Yeah, the $50 million, we did go quickly to realize it. It obviously was a little more lower-hanging fruit than not, but it still takes a lot of time and effort, and we execute it, and we absolutely expect to get a little more out relative to what I'd call the integration. I mean, there's more work to do on the IT systems and tools. We have already aligned them on policies and procedures. All the personnel are already on our payroll systems, our benefit plans, and that type of stuff. So, yeah, we think there's probably an additional $20 million or $30 million that we can get that I would call integration. That will just roll into LHX NeXt. But Ken? And I'll just chime in, Peter, the continuing resolution. While we've had one every year since 2010, and I think we in the industry know how to deal with it, it does tend to slow things down, really, from a customer perspective. So as I mentioned, we are under a CR through March. Hopefully we'll get a defense budget and eleven other appropriation bills passed so we can get back to normal. But that causes a little bit of the slow start, unfortunately, like it does pretty much every year for the last 13. Hey, Seth. Yeah, let me take that. We actually had a pretty -- we had a great year in CS and especially tactical radios specifically. The interesting thing here, as we talk about the margins, is really the mix between the DoD and the International. So when I looked at the first two quarters, we were heavily weighted towards International versus domestic and then it flipped again in Q3, Q4. And we'll start 2024 with a little more domestic deliveries than commercial, and then it flips in the back half. So we had a record year when it came to revenue in TCOM. I think the business is really coming together quite nicely. We've overcome most of the supply chain challenges. I know when we talked in the past, we literally had hundreds of key suppliers that we were tracking. Now we're down to just a handful. So the results are getting better. We're getting dual sources. And in fact, we've recently had some wins in some new markets that we've been informed of. We're not authorized to disclose them quite yet, but there's a lot of good news coming out of TCOM. Good morning. Yes. Thanks, Rob. Let me start -- cover a couple of things and work in specifically your question. The demand, I mentioned earlier, there's more demand than there is supply, which is a great thing when we look back on the acquisition. And to repeat myself, 200 proposals for $13 billion is something we would have never expected in just a six-month period. The infrastructure, great progress. We've got the $50 million. We've got the policies. We've got the personnel. The IT systems are in work. And in fact on the talent front, the attrition at Aerojet Rocketdyne has dropped by 1/3 overall and 50% for the engineers. We do these regular surveys. There's just a lot of enthusiasm and excitement about the acquisition, the strategy. And I think it's a tribute to the team that shows how we successfully have integrated them and welcomed them into L3Harris. Going back to the demand, it's all about capacity. We've talked about the DPA investment for $216 million focused on GMLRS and Javelin and Stinger. In fact, we've already acquired a building in Huntsville, Alabama. Our capacity and footprint there is 4x and that will ultimately -- it is, but it will ultimately be our inert center of excellence, which is great. The challenges are really at the sub-tier suppliers, as you said. I don't think it makes a lot of sense to bring them in-house. We've actually invested in some of these, not as an ownership, but by helping them with tooling and capital. Our customers have also -- our end customer and our immediate prime customers have also invested. So as we've said, there's a little bit of a chokepoint here at the sub-tier. Personally, I think over time, a third solid rocket motor provider is fine. We don't shy away from competition. But that doesn't really solve the problem because at the end of the day, everybody's going to be going to the same sub-tiers, for the cases, for the igniters, for the nozzles and such. So we have to fix the sub-tier. We're doing our part by helping them out financially, getting the equipment, improving their -- the capacity. And we started to see it. There is a big well documented, I think, we call it backlog or undelivered motors, and we're chipping away at that, as I mentioned. And once we get these facilities and equipment up and running, I think it's going to look pretty good. And, yes, there's a lot of people trying to get into this market now, which is fine. It's a high-growth market, and in my mind, reaffirms the rationale and the value potential from this acquisition. Hi, Sheila. Yes. Thanks for the question. I mean, obviously, the broader margin implication is we tend to have higher margins in international than domestic, just like we do with commercial. So I see an increase -- slight increase year-over-year. We're kind of hanging around the 22%, 23% of our revenue comes from international, maybe a little uptick in '24, '25 and '26. But every point helps. I think it comes down to this -- the one that's going to move the needle a little bit is going to be the supplementals. And we haven't talked a whole lot about DC in the budget. But there is a supplemental out there for Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel put out last year for $110 billion. I think about $58 billion is targeted for the DoD. It's all tied up in politics as it relates to border security. But I think at the end of the day, we need to get these things passed because it's really just backfilling the stockpile that we've already given into several of the countries I mentioned. So hopefully, we get that behind us, and that will solidify our growth opportunities in those regions specifically. So as I look at each of the segments. Aerojet, as you know, most of that goes through a couple of primes. So we actually don't have any international revenue the way we disclose it for Aerojet, notwithstanding that several of these products get deployed from -- but from our perspective, we just sell them to two or three primes and then they put them wherever they need to go. So we just call that domestic for what that's worth. IMS, I talked about WESCAM and bizjets, I see upside there. SAS, it's really given the classified nature of so many things they do. We have an occasional space satellite, like I mentioned, in Japan. Some of the avionics stuff goes international as well. And then CS has the highest percentage of international mainly coming out of the tactical radio business. And when I look at what we've done in Ukraine and what's needed in Europe and the Mid-East and the Far East, it's looking rather positive. So I hope that help, Sheila. Good morning. Yes. Good question, Robert. Look, we've all been in this industry for decades, and it kind of goes in cycles where everybody thought fixed-price development programs was a good idea in the '70s and '80s, and then it migrates back to cost-plus and goes the other way. Just kind of have to understand where the customer is and figure out where they're going. There's lots of opportunities to interface with them. We're we've been successful with our commercial business models that I've mentioned. I think there's more that we can look at in that regard. I think more and more things are moving towards software, and I think it's a new area. I think the DoD has to figure out how to buy software and we have to figure out how to sell software. There have been some cases where it's done. But again, that's probably a different business model than your traditional cost-plus, truth in negotiation type regulations may not make sense. And I think that's what a lot of the new entrants are also struggling with, to figure out how to get into those markets. So look, we all get to draft RFPs. We review them, we push back and sometimes you just have to no-bid. And one of these days, the entire industry is not going to bid on a fixed-price development contract and the DoD will change. But when you get one or two bids, they're going to make the award, and we're doing our best to balance the risk with the financial upside that we have, so probably a little more disciplined. But this has been an ongoing debate probably for decades, and we continue to engage with the customer, and I think they appreciate and understand where the industry is coming from. So we'll see what happens in the months and years ahead. So look, before I sign off, I really would like to take a moment and thank our 50,000 employees for their focus on performance and execution throughout the year. Clearly, this is impossible without them, and they're critical to our success in meeting not only our shareholders, but our customer commitments. So really appreciate everybody joining the call. Ken, again, welcome to the team. And we'll be talking to you all soon. Thanks."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings. Welcome to L3Harris Technologies Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mark Kratz, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin.\nMark Kratz: Thank you, Rob. Good morning and thank you everyone for joining us to discuss third quarter results. Joining me are Chris Kubasik, our CEO, and Michelle Turner, our CFO. Yesterday, we published our investor letter detailing our results, guidance and key company updates. So this morning's call will be focused on answering questions. As always, we may discuss certain matters that constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially. For more information, please reference our provision found in our investor letter and our SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to comparable GAAP measures in the investor letter. I'd now like to turn it over to Chris for some brief remarks.\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I know you've all had a busy week, and we appreciate you joining us this morning. The current events in the Middle East remind us that what we do at L3Harris matters. And the industry in which we operate is more critical than ever before. As a national security technology focused company, we remain committed to supporting the U.S. and its allies to deter aggression and foster stability around the world. As we embark on our fifth year since the merger of L3 and Harris, I'm proud of our achievements. We built a diverse and seasoned team that is integrating our company. L3Harris is viewed as a disruptive competitor that is reshaping the U.S. Defense industrial base. Meanwhile, underpinning our strategy is a focus on operational excellence, delivering quality products on time, driving costs out of our system, and focusing our portfolio as a national security company. This ultimately benefits our customers and creates long-term value for our shareholders. While the macro environment has been challenging, we are making considerable progress. The business is on solid footing, and we are building operational momentum. In the third quarter, we reported 16% top-line growth, the second consecutive quarter of sequential margin improvement and strong cash generation, resulting in more than 100% free cash flow conversion. This extends our trend of generating positive free cash flow in each of the quarters since the merger. The team and I look forward to providing more details on our strategy and our 2024 outlook at our Investor Day in December. And with that, Rob, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKristine Liwag: You know Chris, Michelle, after owning Aerojet Rocketdyne now for a few months. Are there any surprises to the positive or negative that you've seen?\nChris Kubasik: Okay, well, I expected an Aerojet question. So let me take this one and try to answer your question and maybe give a little more insight on Aerojet Rocketdyne. But just to refresh everyone's memory, we signed and announced the deal back in December. And we're able to close it in seven and a half months, which I think is pretty impressive in this environment. So either there was support or probably no objections, obviously from industry and in the Department of Defense to allow the acquisition to go through. So probably closed a little quicker than we expected. I think when we announced that we said it could take up to 12 months, but we did hit the ground running on day one. Deployed the L3Harris leadership team to run the business which I thought was critical to the success that we're going to realize. I'll say from an integration perspective, all was going well, we're clearly on track to get the 40 million to 50 million of cost savings that we talked about previously. We've shut down the Aerojet Rocketdyne headquarters in California. We're ready for January 1 to transition all the employees to L3Harris payroll system benefits and such. The IT team is already connected all the network. So the communication and such is working well. And we obviously have a little longer term IT strategy to optimize the business from that perspective. I will say the workforce, we actually did a survey of the workforce about a month ago, and the results were actually off the charts. I was more than pleased to see the enthusiasm of the workforce, the confidence that they have in being part of L3Harris, the alignment of being a part of a larger company that's focused on defense and national security and space. So that's encouraging to get those types of results. So we've been clear, at least internally and hopefully, externally, that our number one priority is to increase the deliveries, specifically in the rocket motor sector. So everything we're doing is focused on increased deliveries, and we developed the plan. Myself and the leadership team has reviewed it and we're off executing on it, includes having Centers of Excellence for [indiscernible], separately, and I think that's going to help with production and flow and deliveries. We've supplemented the existing leadership teams at some of the key locations in Alabama, Arkansas and Virginia with resources and experience that I think is going to start showing immediate results. And then, we've deployed resources to our sub-tier suppliers. And that really is the challenge in the munitions and rocket motor business is a couple of levels down. And we only have, in some cases, 1 or 2 certified suppliers of cases and igniters and sometimes nozzles. So that is ultimately a choke point that we need to focus on as an industry and as a country. The DPA, you've heard us talk about the Defense Production Act, the over $200 million that was awarded earlier this year. That's focused on 3 main products. We have a plan, and we're starting to execute upon that. In fact, we just leased a building in Alabama, so that we can modify and order the equipment to increase capacity at that facility. So we'll use that as a framework. We're going to revitalize the business, and we'll use that for the other products that weren't necessarily covered by the DPA money. So all of this will contribute to 2024 starting to see a ramp-up in the output, and I would expect to have noticeable improvements by the end of 2024 and then continuing into 2025. We've had discussions, I've had discussions with our end customers. different military services, and they are very excited to have L3Harris own this asset. Obviously, they see us as the answer to the challenges and problems that they and the industry has had relative to rocket motors and we have their full support, which I expected, but is also encouraging. We don't talk too much, but we should about the space engine business. And that's maybe about 1/3 of Aerojet Rocketdyne, that business is operating well. The RL10 engine, which is the upper stage is performing flawlessly. I think the run of successes goes back decades without a failure. And it's not even sure, ever has failed. So that's great news. We're excited to be on the United Launch Alliance, ULA first Vulcan launch and subsequent launches. So there's 2 RL10s per launch. And as of today, we have over 150 in backlog. So that gives us pretty good visibility and stability into the space side. So that's kind of operationally where we are relative to Aerojet Rocketdyne, Kristine. But I also want to step back on the strategic rationale for the acquisition. It hasn't quite been a year, but I know people are still asking questions. But at L3Harris, we, as I said, are building a defense-focused, technology-focused company. We're taking a portfolio approach. We're looking to acquire businesses that are aligning with our nation's defense strategy and in growing markets. And then, we're divesting those businesses that don't necessarily align with our strategy but are still good businesses but not part of our focus. So Aerojet Rocketdyne is growing faster than the legacy L3Harris business. I think when we look at everything that has happened since we signed the deal in December, there should be no dispute to demand for these products as they flow through the primes in most cases, is up significantly in the U.S. and in the world, which is why we need to focus on the increase in output. And I already mentioned the DPA money of $200 million, which will help us on these 3 particular lines, increased capacity, move production lines and digitize the engineering. So the tailwinds are there as well. So feel better about the acquisition today than I did in December to be honest with you. And I think it's highlighting my last point, some of the challenges in the industry. Going back to the '80s and the peace time dividend, the industry contracted, our capacity contracted. We're on a kind of a peace time mindset for the last several decades, and I believe, as a country, we need to ramp up to more of a wartime footing. And like I said, I think money and focus needs to go to the sub-tier suppliers that feed into not only us, but other industry partners, generally through primes and then to the end users. So maybe a longer answer than you wanted, Kristine, but I tried to hit a lot of different topics as it surrounds Aerojet Rocketdyne. So I think I'll just end on that.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: I actually wanted to switch subjects and ask about Tactical RF. Maybe, if you could talk about book-to-bill in the quarter where backlog stands and give us some pipeline color, both domestically and internationally? And also if you can answer the supply chain questions, how that's evolved in that business line? Thanks.\nMichelle Turner: Yes. So thanks for the question. From an overall comps perspective, we continue to be on track to deliver to our guidance, which was double-digit growth across the business, which includes to your point, gotten about the [bidding] [ph] supply chain challenges. which we continue to see along with the acquisition of our tactical data links business. Specific to radios and comms from an overall DoD budgetary perspective, we continue to see support. We're about 40% of the way through that modernization program. And we continue to see strong demand internationally as well. And so overall, I'd say we're feeling like we're in a good place from a comps perspective. And then just from looking at supply chain specifically, we continue to see hiccups like you're hearing across the industry, but significant complements to our supply chain, our tactical communication business, Sam Mehta, Chris Abley. The efforts that they've put in over the last 18 to 24 months in truly building a resilient supply chain that allows us to pivot when we continue to experience these hiccups is enabling us to continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders. And the other thing I would note for this quarter is that our overall deliveries are actually up from Q2. And so we continue to see the results of the efforts and the diligence that the team has put in over the last 18 to 24 months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.\nNoah Poponak: Chris, so you've alluded to the competing inputs for national security spending. I guess when you think about what's evolving geopolitically versus what's evolving with the deficit battle in the U.S., maybe some of the short-term items as well. I guess, what do you -- how are you thinking about what your medium-term end market growth rate is? And your latest thinking on the L3Harris spread versus that growth rate?\nChris Kubasik: Yes. No, thanks. Noah, I appreciate the question. As I step back a moment, I think kind of implied in there is the budget and what's going to happen with the supplemental. So as we all know, we finally have the speaker of the house, so that's step 1. I do believe and I've been pretty outspoken on this. It feels like it's an even more dangerous world than it ever has been. You look at what's going on in the Mid East, Ukraine, South China seas, national security has to be a top priority. And I'm concerned that a government shutdown would clearly weaken our national security as does a continuing resolution. So I think I speak for the entire industry and probably our customers, we hope that we get a budget here in the next couple of weeks, so we can start having the money flow to the industrial base. There's been a lot of talk about the supplemental over $100 million, split between state and DoD and Ukraine and Israel and Taiwan and the south border. I think we feel confident there will be a supplemental, I don't know if it will be 1 or 2 or somehow be partitioned, but I look at the supplemental as kind of playing into the near term. And I think when I look at our portfolio of products, literally products, not necessarily systems or platforms, we've been well positioned, specifically in Ukraine with a quick turn on the radios, night vision goggle, sites, sensors, cameras. So I look at the supplemental to kind of help us in the near-term. The midterm, I think, is relying more on a continued budget growth, the need to invest in technologies, advanced technologies for a peer or near-peer threats. And we keep talking about that as part of our national defense strategy, but we keep getting distracted by these other conflicts. So I think that's probably where I feel good about how we've shaped our portfolio specifically in the space arena, a lot of the missions that were normally conducted in the air domain, not all of them, but some of them have been moving to space. And I know people get tired of me saying it. I think this is the best example of our trusted disruptor strategy working. And at the date of the merger, L3Harris had zero satellites in orbit as a Prime. And as I look at our manifest in our backlog, we could very likely have 50, 5-0, 50, L3Harris Prime satellites and orbit in the next 3 to 5 years. So I think we're well positioned there. They tend to be more LEO satellites, 3-to-4-year useful lives, large constellations. So you can kind of see that as a potential ongoing annuity. In fact, we're building state-of-the-art factory for the satellite integration. So clearly, I see upside there. Aerojet Rocketdyne, we talked about the munitions. We are in the rocket motor, solid rocket motor business supporting some great primes who ultimately integrate the missile. So I feel comfortable with our position there. Michelle talked about the radios. We made an acquisition earlier this year on tactical battle links from ViaSat. And we keep talking about the connectivity of this network, and it is happening, and it is going to happen. It's hard to find the budgetary numbers, but these different domains, space, air, land, sea, they have to be able to connect across services, multi-domain, all those buzzwords we hear, but it's critical and it's happening, and someone has asked me best to try to explain with waveforms and all these different things that we're doing with Link 16. And I think the simplest way I could come up with is just categorizing it as Stealth communications. I think that's kind of a simple way to look at it. And we have the footprint on these 20,000 platforms. So we're upgrading, if you will, an existing network of connectivity and I'll just say, making it stealth. So I think depending on the budget world events, you got to feel like mid-single-digit growth is not an unreasonable aspiration over the midterm. And that's what we're striving for. And as I mentioned to Kristine, I still think as a nation, we have to find a way to invest in the infrastructure to build the capacity of this industrial base given the surge of certain key products and areas. So that's how I see it, Noah.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank.\nScott Deuschle: I have two quick questions, both for Michelle. The first is on what's driving the difference between the $56 million of M&A expense add-backs on the P&L and the $215 million of add-backs for M&A on adjusted free cash flow. So that's my first question. And then my second question is what would drive CS margins to the 26% range in the fourth quarter, which is I think what's implied in the guide. Thanks.\nMichelle Turner: Thanks for that Scott. I'm going to start with the margin question and kind of take a step back and address it starting with the enterprise margins because we really think about this as managing our portfolio. So we're encouraged with the overall margin results within the quarter. This is our second consecutive quarter of sequential improving margins at 15% and this includes 2 months of Aerojet as part of our portfolio. And so, we're most pleased because we're starting to see the efforts of our actions related to our Performance First initiative, which you may remember is really grounded in meeting the commitments of our customers and shareholders, and it's starting to pay dividends now in terms of margin improvement. So I'll walk through each of the segments because I think there's a lot of good work that's happening across the organization, plus it gives you a little bit of flavor as to how you should think about your models go forward. So I'll start with our Space and Airborne Systems business. It delivered a record op profit in Q3 and 12.5% margins. And [indiscernible] and the SAS team have really been early adopters on our LHX NeXt initiative in terms of really leaning into maniacally managing cost and spend, but also looking at organizational construct to ensure that we are most effectively running our business. The SAS business also benefited from a couple of accretive contract mods that they were successful and being able to deliver on within the quarter. And so when you look at Q4, there is a step-down as a result of those onetime accretive actions that occurred within Q3. From an Integrated Mission Systems business perspective, this business and along with John Rambo's leadership and the IMS leadership team, saw sequential margin improvement of 180 basis points from Q2. And so you may remember this is where we've had the most acute EAC programmatic challenges in the first half of the year. And a lot of the work that John and his team are doing are starting to pay dividends now where we sit here in Q3. Now this will continue to be a bit of a lumpy part of our portfolio. But we expect that the worst is behind us in terms of overall programmatic challenges within IMS. Within our CS business, I'm getting specifically to your question, Scott, CS delivered consistent with our expectations within the quarter, along with consistent with Q1. And so we anticipated Q3 to be lower margins aligned with a heavier DoD shipment mix from a tactical radio perspective. And as I noted earlier, we actually delivered more radios this quarter. So this really speaks to the efforts that we're really putting around driving a resilient supply chain. A lot of work has gone into this from the teams to make this happen. And then, finally, from an Aerojet perspective, 2 months, a little over 90 days as part of our portfolio, roughly 12% margins within the quarter. You will note though there is a step-down within Q4. Q3 did benefit from about $8 million of purchase price accounting adjustments within the quarter. So we expect in the year consistent with the guide that we have updated for. And then, Scott, to your question about the difference between the expense and the cash impact. This is really driven by the Aerojet acquisition cash that flowed out closure from what was originally booked on the books of Aerojet from an expense perspective, we actually paid that cash post-closing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.\nJason Gursky: I just wanted to go back to the Space business for a minute, if you don't mind. Little contracting things going on here in the industry this quarter, you guys had a positive EAC in one of your customers, one of your competitors out there in the world at a very large start this quarter in the aerospace business. So I wonder if you could just help us or maybe walk around the space portfolio and tell us a little bit about what you have in that portfolio from a fixed price versus cost plus kind of mix and help us understand what the risks are and what the opportunities are as it relates to both revenue in the future. But I think most importantly, given what we're seeing across the industry, kind of what the risks might be on execution in EACs and just kind of help us better understand the overall health of that business.\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Well, let me take that one, Jason. Great question. And yes, I mean to give the answer on the cost plus fixed price, it's about 50-50 between the 2. And that's a big change over the last decade or so. I mean, people generally would have thought of space being predominantly cost plus if you go back 10 or 20 years. And as you know, that trend has changed, bringing more risk to everyone. I think a lot of this goes back, I don't know specifically who you're referring to. But I think a lot of the challenges that the industry is having stems from the supply chain, which I'm sure is getting hold hearing that. But if you go back a few years, we were talking about our portfolio, having a combination of short-cycle, quick-turn products that were reliant on microelectronic parts. So I felt like L3Harris was kind of at the pointy end of the spear and leading the industry and the supply chain adverse impacts given the fact we couldn't get those parts to deliver our core products and recognize the revenue and profit. And then I think the longer cycle business is, which I would kind of throw space in there. It's also having supply chain issues. But the challenge there, I believe, is more on inflation and then workmanship that everybody is dealing with those quality challenges. So while there's still supply chain challenges, I think they've shifted. And I think they're hitting the longer-cycle businesses now. So what we've done is really double down on our bidding discipline, some of the longer-cycle things going back 5 years, probably are making less margin than I would like. But on the new bids, we're clearly factoring in the appropriate risks, taking the most current estimates, and we're not going to bid to lose money and do the best we can whether it's terms and conditions, contract reopenings, escalation clauses to protect ourselves. So I feel like we're doing a pretty good job on the bidding discipline. We have regular independent reviews of our key programs, and that helps, again, identify risk early to the extent we have any and then work on mitigation or workaround. So you see how we're doing relative to the others on margins in space, and we're pretty solid compared to our peers, and we haven't had, fortunately, any major write-offs. We continue to not bid fixed-price development programs that simultaneously ask for development and production, as I've said before. It's hard enough to estimate the development let alone commit to production for 1, 2 or 3 lots in '26, '27 and 2028. So we will continue to now bid those. And ultimately, the customer has to use the right vehicle -- contracting vehicle, I believe. And I think at some point in time, everyone in the industry will stop bidding and we'll get the right vehicle, and we'll fight it out for the best solution. We are more than happy to sacrifice top-line growth for profitability, cash and margin. And I've said before, the best way to get your margins up is stop writing off money on programs, and that moves the needle, and that's what we're trying to do. I think it's some real tangible evidence. We had some fixed price contracts for missile tracking, we have one for the Missile Defense Agency. We refer to as HBTSS, and we have 4 for the SDA, call it Space Force Now, Tranche 0 for tracking. And those satellites are done and waiting to be launched. So I can't wait to get those things in orbit. And I think that's pretty good evidence that we're able to meet our commitments relative to cost and schedule notwithstanding all the challenges from the supply chain inflation, attrition and such. So we feel pretty good about our Aerospace business, and we've been able to attract new talent, which helps as well. So hopefully, that answers your question there, Jason.\nMichelle Turner: I would just add to complement that along with the SDA and NDA work that Chris just referred to. We also have a very steady, stable business that we've been in for decades from a civil weather perspective. And so that -- there's also a growth cycle that's happening there, and we booked about $1.5 billion associated with that business. So it's a good complement to the other work that's really growing from a DoD perspective.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global Research.\nRichard Safran: Chris, I heard your remarks about 2024 in the Investor Day, but I thought you might be willing to discuss and maybe give a qualitative assessment of which segments have the most room to grow in '24? Any color you could provide there, I thought would be helpful.\nChris Kubasik: Are you going to come visit us in December at our Investor Day, Rich?\nRichard Safran: I'm already signed up.\nChris Kubasik: Well, there you go, there you go. I mean this is like the coming attraction here. This is after Taylor Swift, it's the second hottest ticket in Florida apparently. So we're in the process of going through our 2024 plan, actually next month. So I'm not going to actually give you an answer that will be satisfying. I will tell you, based on what I see right now, it looks like all 4 of our segments will be growing. So we'll reveal which ones are growing faster in December. But in all seriousness, we kind of want to get through the next month or two and see what's going to happen. We can't have a government shutdown for any period of time. We can't have a continuing resolution. We all know the impact that has on our business. We all say it really doesn't impact 2023 because the year is 3 quarters over. It's more or less true, but 2024, a 1-year CR, which I'm not at all suggesting will happen. But the one thing we can all agree on is we have no idea what's going to happen in D.C. And I kind of want to get through November and get some of those things behind us, including world events. But right now, it looks like we're going to experience top line growth in all segments. And on a consolidated basis, which we'll be talking about in December. I expect cash and OI and EPS notwithstanding pension headwinds and revenue to all grow. So that's encouraging, but details to come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets.\nKen Herbert: Chris, maybe just following up for Michelle on that comment and some of the comments on AJRD in the opening remarks, beyond some of the Defense Production Act opportunities, can you just talk about how you're viewing CapEx across sort of legacy L3Harris and then more importantly, sort of AJRD as we think about 2024 and half of this year. And are you seeing a need to specifically sort of accelerate CapEx in AJRD to address some of the issues you outlined? And maybe how should we think about that as it relates to the growth in free cash next year?\nChris Kubasik: Yes. I'll start it off and then ask Michelle to fill in. I mean we're going to continue to prioritize our R&D and our CapEx based on business cases and based on needs. I think Aerojet Rocketdyne always had $50 million, $60 million of CapEx in their plan so that I don't see any scenario where that would change or come down significantly. But we'll look at it compared to all the other investments that we have. I think I've all been said, it's a pretty high-growth market. and we're trying to accelerate. So between the DPA money, which is over 200, the $50 million to $60 million annual CapEx, any other supplemental sources of funding we get sometimes from states and local municipalities. I think it all fits within our overall CapEx target and to the extent we need more, it will be at the expense of something else in the legacy portfolio that we don't view is having the near-term need or the ROI. So that's kind of how I see it. There could be new markets down the road once we kind of catch up on this acceleration. And those will be case by case, but there's a lot of exciting new technologies within Aerojet Rocketdyne, but the team is really focused on the backlog and the core business for now.\nMichelle Turner: Yes. So I would just add in terms of your question, Ken, around free cash flow for next year. So to Chris' comments, we do expect income to grow. So we think that, that will be a tailwind from an overall cash perspective. We expect some kind of nominal improvement in working capital. And then offsetting that, just as a reminder for everybody, our initial deal model on Aerojet assumed free cash flow accretion in year 2. So we expect there'll be some kind of marginal impact just in totality of where they're at in the program cycle. And then, on overall CapEx, we typically run around 2%. We're not expecting any fundamental change in that level of investment as we go into next year.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo.\nMatt Akers: I wanted to ask if you could touch on LHX NeXt a little bit. And specifically, just curious of the $500 million benefit that you called out, how much do you get to keep? Does any of that flow back to your customer or any other offsets we should think about?\nMichelle Turner: Yes. Thanks for this question. I'm glad we're getting to talk about it a little bit more. And so this is the next phase of our L3 and Harris merger evolution, if you will. And so if you think about the initial integration savings that we did as a company, several hundred million along with some offsets. This is the next phase of this, kind of the harder parts, if you will. And it's really focused on leveraging our scale to drive efficiencies and also functional organization to ensure that we're optimized for value creation. And so to your point specifically around the overall bottom-line impact, we do anticipate that there's more investment that goes along with this phase of the journey, Matt. So you'll see in our investor letter, we laid out about $400 million of investment. And so you should think of this more as a nominal tailwind from a margin perspective and not flow it all to the bottom-line. But I do want to highlight a couple of tangible examples that the teams have already driven as we're in the early stages of this, just so you can start to characterize what are we talking about, when we're talking high level about LHX NeXt. And one of our recent wins, I'll complement our HR team in [indiscernible]. They've done a fantastic job in renegotiating our employee benefit package, again, leveraging the scale of the new L3Harris portfolio to not only increase our benefits and also save on costs, but we're also going to be holding our employee benefit cost flat to our employees. So this is really creating a win-win opportunity, both from a shareholder perspective, and our employees in terms of better benefits while maintaining the cost that they have to flow back to their families. And then, on the organizational side of the equation, our comms team led by Tania Hanna has redesigned how we serve the company from a comms perspective and really focusing on the things that matter, right? And so, when you think about comms and how we send out external communications or internal communications, what are the things that are really going to move the needle from a value creation perspective in terms of our shareholders. And so they focused on streamlining our overall workflows, and we've actually reduced double digits the number of communications that we're distributing as a result. So that gives you a little bit of color as to the things we're looking at. But the biggest buckets, I would highlight here are really around the material opportunities, both on the direct side and the indirect side of the equation. And so again, going back to -- we're in our fifth year as a company and truly leveraging the scale of L3Harris as a $35 billion market cap. And what we can bring to the table and negotiating with our suppliers has a real opportunity to drive value for our shareholders.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.\nSeth Seifman: Michelle, maybe another question for you. If you could talk about the path to the delevering and just kind of how much cash you need to have on the balance sheet. I think there's probably some more debt coming up, then the company will have an ability to repay. So how do you think about what to term out versus what to repay now?\nMichelle Turner: Yes. Thanks for this question as we want every opportunity, we can to highlight that we are focused on debt repayment. And so what are we going to focus on first? We're going to focus on the commercial paper, the higher interest rates the variable rates, if you will. Where we sit today, post-acquisition, we're at $13.5 billion, and our target by the end of the year is to get to about $13 billion of debt. And so from a leverage ratio perspective, we're looking to be at 3.5 and our expectation is that we get below 3 over the next couple of years.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\nChris Kubasik: Rob, this will be our last question this morning.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Just stepping back, big picture, your margins are 15% today. How do we think about expansion from here, is it possible? And then, to that extent maybe specifically on communication systems, can you talk about the puts and takes there? Can you shake off some of these supply chain issues? And how do you think about the improvement progress and just the core margin of that business and run away from here?\nChris Kubasik: Okay. I think I'll take this one since it's our last question, Sheila, and I guess you snuck in right under the wire here. So good morning. Yes, thanks for acknowledging the 15%, which I think are industry-leading margins, which we are quite, quite proud of. And even though they are industry leading, we are committed to find ways to continue to grow those margins. So on the CS side, we do have the commercial business model, which has played well for us. And that goes beyond just the tactical radios, we also have it at West Cam with our turrets and some of our sensors. So I think that's just an area that we need to leverage. We've been increasing our prices to cover the dilutive effect of the cost increase. And I think that's something that this industry doesn't naturally do. I think we all see in our day-to-day lives, prices are going up all over the place. So we tend to try to want to hold pricing flat. But the new reality is, it's cost you more to buy components and labor. And Michelle mentioned, holding the employee benefit costs flat for 2 years in a row. Those are going to be priced into our products, plain and simple, and that's going to help keep the profitability where it is, if not maybe even increase it. And again, we'll try to leverage the supply chain and power the enterprise. We recently had some successful negotiations by working across all the segments and sectors, getting all the buy together and negotiating at a corporate-wide basis for actually direct material, and everybody does that for indirect, but direct is a lot harder, and we were able to pull that off. So I think that's a key part of it. We haven't talked about E3. That is just in the DNA. It's something we do every day, and that will continue to offset some of the headwinds and contribute to our bottom-line. LHX NeXt, as Michelle gave a great description is, I think, is really a key differentiator for us. It's the continuation, like you said, of what we started with the merger. I think we did the easy stuff first and this is the harder piece and the ultimate goal is to simplify the business and change the way we do business. Everyone wants to just take an arbitrary cut to lower their G&A or overhead, but we are looking at everything and seeing if we can eliminate it, do it differently. And she gave some good early examples, but I think there's a heck of a lot more we can do and that will contribute to lowering our cost base, which will make us more competitive and/or contribute to the bottom-line. And I said it earlier, and I think it's the truth. If you just look at the programs, which you don't have all the visibility to, I appreciate. But if you don't debook profit and you don't have losses, the margins will just naturally grow. So that comes back to the discipline, and I will trade off revenue growth every day of the week for profitable programs. And it's easy to say and sometimes it's harder to do, but if we can get to the point where we're not writing off money on programs for whatever reason, there's only overhead material and labor sounds simple, but you have to get the right contracting vehicle, the right contracting terms, push back on the customer and negotiate a fair deal for all, and that's something we are absolutely going to do. Relative to the mix, I think what you're getting out there is, we do have a portfolio, and we're always going to have cost-plus jobs and fixed price and the cost-plus jobs, generally our development and on the front-end of a potential long-term franchise or annuity of programs. So we will bid, and we will win cost-plus programs. And we all know those margins are dilutive. But I look at it on an ROIC basis, it's effectively infinite. So if we can get 9%, 10%, 11%, 12% cost-plus jobs that lead to low-rate production that lead to full rate production that lead to exporting. That is the grand slam of new business. We will bid it each and every time. And as a portfolio, as Michelle said, we run the company as a portfolio, we look at our financial results as a portfolio. Some segments have a good quarter, some don't. We put it all together, I could not be more proud of the team and what we were able to accomplish in the third quarter, we exceeded expectations on revenue, EPS and cash and it's something we're quite proud of.\nChris Kubasik: So I think with that, I'll just thank everybody for joining the call this morning and another shout out to the employees who are really coming through and delivering a great third quarter. I know we're all working hard on Q4 and can't wait to see everybody in early December for our Investor Day down here in Florida. So with that, we will sign off, and thank you again.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Kubasik",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I know you've all had a busy week, and we appreciate you joining us this morning. The current events in the Middle East remind us that what we do at L3Harris matters. And the industry in which we operate is more critical than ever before. As a national security technology focused company, we remain committed to supporting the U.S. and its allies to deter aggression and foster stability around the world. As we embark on our fifth year since the merger of L3 and Harris, I'm proud of our achievements. We built a diverse and seasoned team that is integrating our company. L3Harris is viewed as a disruptive competitor that is reshaping the U.S. Defense industrial base. Meanwhile, underpinning our strategy is a focus on operational excellence, delivering quality products on time, driving costs out of our system, and focusing our portfolio as a national security company. This ultimately benefits our customers and creates long-term value for our shareholders. While the macro environment has been challenging, we are making considerable progress. The business is on solid footing, and we are building operational momentum. In the third quarter, we reported 16% top-line growth, the second consecutive quarter of sequential margin improvement and strong cash generation, resulting in more than 100% free cash flow conversion. This extends our trend of generating positive free cash flow in each of the quarters since the merger. The team and I look forward to providing more details on our strategy and our 2024 outlook at our Investor Day in December. And with that, Rob, let's open the line for questions. Okay, well, I expected an Aerojet question. So let me take this one and try to answer your question and maybe give a little more insight on Aerojet Rocketdyne. But just to refresh everyone's memory, we signed and announced the deal back in December. And we're able to close it in seven and a half months, which I think is pretty impressive in this environment. So either there was support or probably no objections, obviously from industry and in the Department of Defense to allow the acquisition to go through. So probably closed a little quicker than we expected. I think when we announced that we said it could take up to 12 months, but we did hit the ground running on day one. Deployed the L3Harris leadership team to run the business which I thought was critical to the success that we're going to realize. I'll say from an integration perspective, all was going well, we're clearly on track to get the 40 million to 50 million of cost savings that we talked about previously. We've shut down the Aerojet Rocketdyne headquarters in California. We're ready for January 1 to transition all the employees to L3Harris payroll system benefits and such. The IT team is already connected all the network. So the communication and such is working well. And we obviously have a little longer term IT strategy to optimize the business from that perspective. I will say the workforce, we actually did a survey of the workforce about a month ago, and the results were actually off the charts. I was more than pleased to see the enthusiasm of the workforce, the confidence that they have in being part of L3Harris, the alignment of being a part of a larger company that's focused on defense and national security and space. So that's encouraging to get those types of results. So we've been clear, at least internally and hopefully, externally, that our number one priority is to increase the deliveries, specifically in the rocket motor sector. So everything we're doing is focused on increased deliveries, and we developed the plan. Myself and the leadership team has reviewed it and we're off executing on it, includes having Centers of Excellence for [indiscernible], separately, and I think that's going to help with production and flow and deliveries. We've supplemented the existing leadership teams at some of the key locations in Alabama, Arkansas and Virginia with resources and experience that I think is going to start showing immediate results. And then, we've deployed resources to our sub-tier suppliers. And that really is the challenge in the munitions and rocket motor business is a couple of levels down. And we only have, in some cases, 1 or 2 certified suppliers of cases and igniters and sometimes nozzles. So that is ultimately a choke point that we need to focus on as an industry and as a country. The DPA, you've heard us talk about the Defense Production Act, the over $200 million that was awarded earlier this year. That's focused on 3 main products. We have a plan, and we're starting to execute upon that. In fact, we just leased a building in Alabama, so that we can modify and order the equipment to increase capacity at that facility. So we'll use that as a framework. We're going to revitalize the business, and we'll use that for the other products that weren't necessarily covered by the DPA money. So all of this will contribute to 2024 starting to see a ramp-up in the output, and I would expect to have noticeable improvements by the end of 2024 and then continuing into 2025. We've had discussions, I've had discussions with our end customers. different military services, and they are very excited to have L3Harris own this asset. Obviously, they see us as the answer to the challenges and problems that they and the industry has had relative to rocket motors and we have their full support, which I expected, but is also encouraging. We don't talk too much, but we should about the space engine business. And that's maybe about 1/3 of Aerojet Rocketdyne, that business is operating well. The RL10 engine, which is the upper stage is performing flawlessly. I think the run of successes goes back decades without a failure. And it's not even sure, ever has failed. So that's great news. We're excited to be on the United Launch Alliance, ULA first Vulcan launch and subsequent launches. So there's 2 RL10s per launch. And as of today, we have over 150 in backlog. So that gives us pretty good visibility and stability into the space side. So that's kind of operationally where we are relative to Aerojet Rocketdyne, Kristine. But I also want to step back on the strategic rationale for the acquisition. It hasn't quite been a year, but I know people are still asking questions. But at L3Harris, we, as I said, are building a defense-focused, technology-focused company. We're taking a portfolio approach. We're looking to acquire businesses that are aligning with our nation's defense strategy and in growing markets. And then, we're divesting those businesses that don't necessarily align with our strategy but are still good businesses but not part of our focus. So Aerojet Rocketdyne is growing faster than the legacy L3Harris business. I think when we look at everything that has happened since we signed the deal in December, there should be no dispute to demand for these products as they flow through the primes in most cases, is up significantly in the U.S. and in the world, which is why we need to focus on the increase in output. And I already mentioned the DPA money of $200 million, which will help us on these 3 particular lines, increased capacity, move production lines and digitize the engineering. So the tailwinds are there as well. So feel better about the acquisition today than I did in December to be honest with you. And I think it's highlighting my last point, some of the challenges in the industry. Going back to the '80s and the peace time dividend, the industry contracted, our capacity contracted. We're on a kind of a peace time mindset for the last several decades, and I believe, as a country, we need to ramp up to more of a wartime footing. And like I said, I think money and focus needs to go to the sub-tier suppliers that feed into not only us, but other industry partners, generally through primes and then to the end users. So maybe a longer answer than you wanted, Kristine, but I tried to hit a lot of different topics as it surrounds Aerojet Rocketdyne. So I think I'll just end on that. Yes. No, thanks. Noah, I appreciate the question. As I step back a moment, I think kind of implied in there is the budget and what's going to happen with the supplemental. So as we all know, we finally have the speaker of the house, so that's step 1. I do believe and I've been pretty outspoken on this. It feels like it's an even more dangerous world than it ever has been. You look at what's going on in the Mid East, Ukraine, South China seas, national security has to be a top priority. And I'm concerned that a government shutdown would clearly weaken our national security as does a continuing resolution. So I think I speak for the entire industry and probably our customers, we hope that we get a budget here in the next couple of weeks, so we can start having the money flow to the industrial base. There's been a lot of talk about the supplemental over $100 million, split between state and DoD and Ukraine and Israel and Taiwan and the south border. I think we feel confident there will be a supplemental, I don't know if it will be 1 or 2 or somehow be partitioned, but I look at the supplemental as kind of playing into the near term. And I think when I look at our portfolio of products, literally products, not necessarily systems or platforms, we've been well positioned, specifically in Ukraine with a quick turn on the radios, night vision goggle, sites, sensors, cameras. So I look at the supplemental to kind of help us in the near-term. The midterm, I think, is relying more on a continued budget growth, the need to invest in technologies, advanced technologies for a peer or near-peer threats. And we keep talking about that as part of our national defense strategy, but we keep getting distracted by these other conflicts. So I think that's probably where I feel good about how we've shaped our portfolio specifically in the space arena, a lot of the missions that were normally conducted in the air domain, not all of them, but some of them have been moving to space. And I know people get tired of me saying it. I think this is the best example of our trusted disruptor strategy working. And at the date of the merger, L3Harris had zero satellites in orbit as a Prime. And as I look at our manifest in our backlog, we could very likely have 50, 5-0, 50, L3Harris Prime satellites and orbit in the next 3 to 5 years. So I think we're well positioned there. They tend to be more LEO satellites, 3-to-4-year useful lives, large constellations. So you can kind of see that as a potential ongoing annuity. In fact, we're building state-of-the-art factory for the satellite integration. So clearly, I see upside there. Aerojet Rocketdyne, we talked about the munitions. We are in the rocket motor, solid rocket motor business supporting some great primes who ultimately integrate the missile. So I feel comfortable with our position there. Michelle talked about the radios. We made an acquisition earlier this year on tactical battle links from ViaSat. And we keep talking about the connectivity of this network, and it is happening, and it is going to happen. It's hard to find the budgetary numbers, but these different domains, space, air, land, sea, they have to be able to connect across services, multi-domain, all those buzzwords we hear, but it's critical and it's happening, and someone has asked me best to try to explain with waveforms and all these different things that we're doing with Link 16. And I think the simplest way I could come up with is just categorizing it as Stealth communications. I think that's kind of a simple way to look at it. And we have the footprint on these 20,000 platforms. So we're upgrading, if you will, an existing network of connectivity and I'll just say, making it stealth. So I think depending on the budget world events, you got to feel like mid-single-digit growth is not an unreasonable aspiration over the midterm. And that's what we're striving for. And as I mentioned to Kristine, I still think as a nation, we have to find a way to invest in the infrastructure to build the capacity of this industrial base given the surge of certain key products and areas. So that's how I see it, Noah. Okay. Well, let me take that one, Jason. Great question. And yes, I mean to give the answer on the cost plus fixed price, it's about 50-50 between the 2. And that's a big change over the last decade or so. I mean, people generally would have thought of space being predominantly cost plus if you go back 10 or 20 years. And as you know, that trend has changed, bringing more risk to everyone. I think a lot of this goes back, I don't know specifically who you're referring to. But I think a lot of the challenges that the industry is having stems from the supply chain, which I'm sure is getting hold hearing that. But if you go back a few years, we were talking about our portfolio, having a combination of short-cycle, quick-turn products that were reliant on microelectronic parts. So I felt like L3Harris was kind of at the pointy end of the spear and leading the industry and the supply chain adverse impacts given the fact we couldn't get those parts to deliver our core products and recognize the revenue and profit. And then I think the longer cycle business is, which I would kind of throw space in there. It's also having supply chain issues. But the challenge there, I believe, is more on inflation and then workmanship that everybody is dealing with those quality challenges. So while there's still supply chain challenges, I think they've shifted. And I think they're hitting the longer-cycle businesses now. So what we've done is really double down on our bidding discipline, some of the longer-cycle things going back 5 years, probably are making less margin than I would like. But on the new bids, we're clearly factoring in the appropriate risks, taking the most current estimates, and we're not going to bid to lose money and do the best we can whether it's terms and conditions, contract reopenings, escalation clauses to protect ourselves. So I feel like we're doing a pretty good job on the bidding discipline. We have regular independent reviews of our key programs, and that helps, again, identify risk early to the extent we have any and then work on mitigation or workaround. So you see how we're doing relative to the others on margins in space, and we're pretty solid compared to our peers, and we haven't had, fortunately, any major write-offs. We continue to not bid fixed-price development programs that simultaneously ask for development and production, as I've said before. It's hard enough to estimate the development let alone commit to production for 1, 2 or 3 lots in '26, '27 and 2028. So we will continue to now bid those. And ultimately, the customer has to use the right vehicle -- contracting vehicle, I believe. And I think at some point in time, everyone in the industry will stop bidding and we'll get the right vehicle, and we'll fight it out for the best solution. We are more than happy to sacrifice top-line growth for profitability, cash and margin. And I've said before, the best way to get your margins up is stop writing off money on programs, and that moves the needle, and that's what we're trying to do. I think it's some real tangible evidence. We had some fixed price contracts for missile tracking, we have one for the Missile Defense Agency. We refer to as HBTSS, and we have 4 for the SDA, call it Space Force Now, Tranche 0 for tracking. And those satellites are done and waiting to be launched. So I can't wait to get those things in orbit. And I think that's pretty good evidence that we're able to meet our commitments relative to cost and schedule notwithstanding all the challenges from the supply chain inflation, attrition and such. So we feel pretty good about our Aerospace business, and we've been able to attract new talent, which helps as well. So hopefully, that answers your question there, Jason. Are you going to come visit us in December at our Investor Day, Rich? Well, there you go, there you go. I mean this is like the coming attraction here. This is after Taylor Swift, it's the second hottest ticket in Florida apparently. So we're in the process of going through our 2024 plan, actually next month. So I'm not going to actually give you an answer that will be satisfying. I will tell you, based on what I see right now, it looks like all 4 of our segments will be growing. So we'll reveal which ones are growing faster in December. But in all seriousness, we kind of want to get through the next month or two and see what's going to happen. We can't have a government shutdown for any period of time. We can't have a continuing resolution. We all know the impact that has on our business. We all say it really doesn't impact 2023 because the year is 3 quarters over. It's more or less true, but 2024, a 1-year CR, which I'm not at all suggesting will happen. But the one thing we can all agree on is we have no idea what's going to happen in D.C. And I kind of want to get through November and get some of those things behind us, including world events. But right now, it looks like we're going to experience top line growth in all segments. And on a consolidated basis, which we'll be talking about in December. I expect cash and OI and EPS notwithstanding pension headwinds and revenue to all grow. So that's encouraging, but details to come. Yes. I'll start it off and then ask Michelle to fill in. I mean we're going to continue to prioritize our R&D and our CapEx based on business cases and based on needs. I think Aerojet Rocketdyne always had $50 million, $60 million of CapEx in their plan so that I don't see any scenario where that would change or come down significantly. But we'll look at it compared to all the other investments that we have. I think I've all been said, it's a pretty high-growth market. and we're trying to accelerate. So between the DPA money, which is over 200, the $50 million to $60 million annual CapEx, any other supplemental sources of funding we get sometimes from states and local municipalities. I think it all fits within our overall CapEx target and to the extent we need more, it will be at the expense of something else in the legacy portfolio that we don't view is having the near-term need or the ROI. So that's kind of how I see it. There could be new markets down the road once we kind of catch up on this acceleration. And those will be case by case, but there's a lot of exciting new technologies within Aerojet Rocketdyne, but the team is really focused on the backlog and the core business for now. Rob, this will be our last question this morning. Okay. I think I'll take this one since it's our last question, Sheila, and I guess you snuck in right under the wire here. So good morning. Yes, thanks for acknowledging the 15%, which I think are industry-leading margins, which we are quite, quite proud of. And even though they are industry leading, we are committed to find ways to continue to grow those margins. So on the CS side, we do have the commercial business model, which has played well for us. And that goes beyond just the tactical radios, we also have it at West Cam with our turrets and some of our sensors. So I think that's just an area that we need to leverage.

I think we all see in our day-to-day lives, prices are going up all over the place. So we tend to try to want to hold pricing flat. But the new reality is, it's cost you more to buy components and labor. And Michelle mentioned, holding the employee benefit costs flat for 2 years in a row. Those are going to be priced into our products, plain and simple, and that's going to help keep the profitability where it is, if not maybe even increase it. And again, we'll try to leverage the supply chain and power the enterprise. We recently had some successful negotiations by working across all the segments and sectors, getting all the buy together and negotiating at a corporate-wide basis for actually direct material, and everybody does that for indirect, but direct is a lot harder, and we were able to pull that off. So I think that's a key part of it. We haven't talked about E3. That is just in the DNA. It's something we do every day, and that will continue to offset some of the headwinds and contribute to our bottom-line. LHX NeXt, as Michelle gave a great description is, I think, is really a key differentiator for us. It's the continuation, like you said, of what we started with the merger. I think we did the easy stuff first and this is the harder piece and the ultimate goal is to simplify the business and change the way we do business.

And she gave some good early examples, but I think there's a heck of a lot more we can do and that will contribute to lowering our cost base, which will make us more competitive and/or contribute to the bottom-line.

But if you don't debook profit and you don't have losses, the margins will just naturally grow. So that comes back to the discipline, and I will trade off revenue growth every day of the week for profitable programs. And it's easy to say and sometimes it's harder to do, but if we can get to the point where we're not writing off money on programs for whatever reason, there's only overhead material and labor sounds simple, but you have to get the right contracting vehicle, the right contracting terms, push back on the customer and negotiate a fair deal for all, and that's something we are absolutely going to do. Relative to the mix, I think what you're getting out there is, we do have a portfolio, and we're always going to have cost-plus jobs and fixed price and the cost-plus jobs, generally our development and on the front-end of a potential long-term franchise or annuity of programs. So we will bid, and we will win cost-plus programs. And we all know those margins are dilutive. But I look at it on an ROIC basis, it's effectively infinite. So if we can get 9%, 10%, 11%, 12% cost-plus jobs that lead to low-rate production that lead to full rate production that lead to exporting. That is the grand slam of new business. We will bid it each and every time. And as a portfolio, as Michelle said, we run the company as a portfolio, we look at our financial results as a portfolio.

We put it all together, I could not be more proud of the team and what we were able to accomplish in the third quarter, we exceeded expectations on revenue, EPS and cash and it's something we're quite proud of. So I think with that, I'll just thank everybody for joining the call this morning and another shout out to the employees who are really coming through and delivering a great third quarter. I know we're all working hard on Q4 and can't wait to see everybody in early December for our Investor Day down here in Florida. So with that, we will sign off, and thank you again."

            "name": "Michelle Turner",
            "content": "Yes. So thanks for the question. From an overall comps perspective, we continue to be on track to deliver to our guidance, which was double-digit growth across the business, which includes to your point, gotten about the [bidding] [ph] supply chain challenges. which we continue to see along with the acquisition of our tactical data links business. Specific to radios and comms from an overall DoD budgetary perspective, we continue to see support. We're about 40% of the way through that modernization program. And we continue to see strong demand internationally as well. And so overall, I'd say we're feeling like we're in a good place from a comps perspective. And then just from looking at supply chain specifically, we continue to see hiccups like you're hearing across the industry, but significant complements to our supply chain, our tactical communication business, Sam Mehta, Chris Abley. The efforts that they've put in over the last 18 to 24 months in truly building a resilient supply chain that allows us to pivot when we continue to experience these hiccups is enabling us to continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders. And the other thing I would note for this quarter is that our overall deliveries are actually up from Q2. And so we continue to see the results of the efforts and the diligence that the team has put in over the last 18 to 24 months. Thanks for that Scott. I'm going to start with the margin question and kind of take a step back and address it starting with the enterprise margins because we really think about this as managing our portfolio. So we're encouraged with the overall margin results within the quarter. This is our second consecutive quarter of sequential improving margins at 15% and this includes 2 months of Aerojet as part of our portfolio. And so, we're most pleased because we're starting to see the efforts of our actions related to our Performance First initiative, which you may remember is really grounded in meeting the commitments of our customers and shareholders, and it's starting to pay dividends now in terms of margin improvement. So I'll walk through each of the segments because I think there's a lot of good work that's happening across the organization, plus it gives you a little bit of flavor as to how you should think about your models go forward. So I'll start with our Space and Airborne Systems business. It delivered a record op profit in Q3 and 12.5% margins. And [indiscernible] and the SAS team have really been early adopters on our LHX NeXt initiative in terms of really leaning into maniacally managing cost and spend, but also looking at organizational construct to ensure that we are most effectively running our business. The SAS business also benefited from a couple of accretive contract mods that they were successful and being able to deliver on within the quarter. And so when you look at Q4, there is a step-down as a result of those onetime accretive actions that occurred within Q3. From an Integrated Mission Systems business perspective, this business and along with John Rambo's leadership and the IMS leadership team, saw sequential margin improvement of 180 basis points from Q2. And so you may remember this is where we've had the most acute EAC programmatic challenges in the first half of the year. And a lot of the work that John and his team are doing are starting to pay dividends now where we sit here in Q3. Now this will continue to be a bit of a lumpy part of our portfolio. But we expect that the worst is behind us in terms of overall programmatic challenges within IMS. Within our CS business, I'm getting specifically to your question, Scott, CS delivered consistent with our expectations within the quarter, along with consistent with Q1. And so we anticipated Q3 to be lower margins aligned with a heavier DoD shipment mix from a tactical radio perspective. And as I noted earlier, we actually delivered more radios this quarter. So this really speaks to the efforts that we're really putting around driving a resilient supply chain. A lot of work has gone into this from the teams to make this happen. And then, finally, from an Aerojet perspective, 2 months, a little over 90 days as part of our portfolio, roughly 12% margins within the quarter. You will note though there is a step-down within Q4. Q3 did benefit from about $8 million of purchase price accounting adjustments within the quarter. So we expect in the year consistent with the guide that we have updated for. And then, Scott, to your question about the difference between the expense and the cash impact. This is really driven by the Aerojet acquisition cash that flowed out closure from what was originally booked on the books of Aerojet from an expense perspective, we actually paid that cash post-closing. I would just add to complement that along with the SDA and NDA work that Chris just referred to. We also have a very steady, stable business that we've been in for decades from a civil weather perspective. And so that -- there's also a growth cycle that's happening there, and we booked about $1.5 billion associated with that business. So it's a good complement to the other work that's really growing from a DoD perspective. Yes. So I would just add in terms of your question, Ken, around free cash flow for next year. So to Chris' comments, we do expect income to grow. So we think that, that will be a tailwind from an overall cash perspective. We expect some kind of nominal improvement in working capital. And then offsetting that, just as a reminder for everybody, our initial deal model on Aerojet assumed free cash flow accretion in year 2. So we expect there'll be some kind of marginal impact just in totality of where they're at in the program cycle. And then, on overall CapEx, we typically run around 2%. We're not expecting any fundamental change in that level of investment as we go into next year. Yes. Thanks for this question. I'm glad we're getting to talk about it a little bit more. And so this is the next phase of our L3 and Harris merger evolution, if you will. And so if you think about the initial integration savings that we did as a company, several hundred million along with some offsets. This is the next phase of this, kind of the harder parts, if you will. And it's really focused on leveraging our scale to drive efficiencies and also functional organization to ensure that we're optimized for value creation. And so to your point specifically around the overall bottom-line impact, we do anticipate that there's more investment that goes along with this phase of the journey, Matt. So you'll see in our investor letter, we laid out about $400 million of investment. And so you should think of this more as a nominal tailwind from a margin perspective and not flow it all to the bottom-line. But I do want to highlight a couple of tangible examples that the teams have already driven as we're in the early stages of this, just so you can start to characterize what are we talking about, when we're talking high level about LHX NeXt. And one of our recent wins, I'll complement our HR team in [indiscernible]. They've done a fantastic job in renegotiating our employee benefit package, again, leveraging the scale of the new L3Harris portfolio to not only increase our benefits and also save on costs, but we're also going to be holding our employee benefit cost flat to our employees. So this is really creating a win-win opportunity, both from a shareholder perspective, and our employees in terms of better benefits while maintaining the cost that they have to flow back to their families. And then, on the organizational side of the equation, our comms team led by Tania Hanna has redesigned how we serve the company from a comms perspective and really focusing on the things that matter, right? And so, when you think about comms and how we send out external communications or internal communications, what are the things that are really going to move the needle from a value creation perspective in terms of our shareholders. And so they focused on streamlining our overall workflows, and we've actually reduced double digits the number of communications that we're distributing as a result. So that gives you a little bit of color as to the things we're looking at. But the biggest buckets, I would highlight here are really around the material opportunities, both on the direct side and the indirect side of the equation. And so again, going back to -- we're in our fifth year as a company and truly leveraging the scale of L3Harris as a $35 billion market cap. And what we can bring to the table and negotiating with our suppliers has a real opportunity to drive value for our shareholders. Yes. Thanks for this question as we want every opportunity, we can to highlight that we are focused on debt repayment. And so what are we going to focus on first? We're going to focus on the commercial paper, the higher interest rates the variable rates, if you will. Where we sit today, post-acquisition, we're at $13.5 billion, and our target by the end of the year is to get to about $13 billion of debt. And so from a leverage ratio perspective, we're looking to be at 3.5 and our expectation is that we get below 3 over the next couple of years."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. At this time, it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mark Kratz, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin.\nMark Kratz: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and welcome to today's call. Joining me are Chris Kubasik, our CEO, and Michelle Turner, our CFO. During our discussion, we may reference the investor letter that we published to the website yesterday. As always, this call will primarily be focused on answering questions. As you can imagine, given the news, we have a busy day. So we're going to hold the call to 40 minutes this morning. I will be available throughout the day for follow-ups. During the call, we may discuss certain matters that constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please reference the safe harbor provision found in the investor letter and our SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to comparable GAAP measures in the investor letter. Lastly, we conducted an investor perception study in the second quarter and we recently reviewed the results with the Board. I want to thank those who participated and we are incorporating your feedback. Before moving to questions, I'd like to turn it over to Chris for some opening remarks.\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday marked a significant milestone for L3Harris in our acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Our investor letter disclosed that the FTC will not block our acquisition. This is one of the final closing conditions for the transaction, and we are moving forward to close in the next day or so. I look forward to extending a warm welcome to Aerojet's team of over 5,000 employees who will soon become part of L3Harris. This acquisition represents a pivotal moment for both our company and the defense industry and is poised to generate shareholder value beyond initial expectations. Budgets are increasing for munitions, and the DoD has committed DPA, Defense Production Act, funding for the expansion and modernization of Aerojet Rocketdyne's operations. Upon closing, this acquisition will strengthen the defense industrial base, foster healthy competition and accelerate innovation in support of the war fighter. In conjunction with this exciting news, we continue to focus on execution across the enterprise and have delivered on our financial commitments again in second quarter. Our results reflect the momentum we have been building over the last year, as the team delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of top-line growth which accelerated to 13% with increases in each segment. We don't talk much about our sectors, but 13 of the 14 grew their top-line in Q2 and 13 of 14 had a book-to-bill greater than 1.0. This gives me confidence that we've been investing in the right technologies, and we are aligned with customer priorities. Operating income was up 7% and margins expanded 50 basis points sequentially as we had anticipated. In total, we delivered earnings of $2.95 -- $2.97 per share, ahead of consensus and free cash flow was positive, in line with prior commentary at over $300 million. Given our performance to-date, we are increasing revenue and EPS guidance for the year and reiterating our free cash flow commitment. With easing supply chain constraints, operational improvement initiatives, and accelerating sequential growth in product-centric businesses, we remain focused on delivering second half results for 2023. With that, let's open the line for questions, Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Arment: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Chris, Michelle and Mark. Chris, congratulations on the Aerojet deal. If it's okay, I wanted to kind of focus on that, just versus asking a question about the quarter. But maybe to start, maybe you could just give us high levels, walk us through kind of the go-forward plan on Aerojet and did you have to sign any consent agreements and any comments you would like talk about on integration would be helpful. Thanks again.\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Well, thanks Peter. Just as a reminder, we announced -- signed and announced the deal back in December. We received our second request in mid-March. And here we are 7.5 months later, ready to close the transaction. So it really was a great team effort. I'm not sure everyone appreciates how much time and effort it takes to go through that process. So a special call-out to the L3Harris team, because all because this was in addition to their day jobs. The IT organization going back years, searching emails, text, legal, finance, contracts and a lot of our external partners. So very proud of the team to be where we are in a relatively pretty -- pretty short period of time. It was a very thorough review by the FTC as you can imagine and obviously the DoD, Department of Defense, would have had some input. So we responded to all inquiries and we are where we are today. So we put out that announcement as the -- as the waiting period has expired yesterday. Over the next day or so, we have to finalize the financing and then close the transaction. And I think we're going to be in a good shape to hit the ground running. Relative to your question about the consent agreement, we did not negotiate or sign a consent agreement. We gave assurances to the DoD that we would be a merchant supplier of rocket motors and rocket engines We have a long legacy of being a merchant supplier and we'll continue with that model once we close Aerojet Rocketdyne. I can assure you we are highly motivated to sell rocket engines and rocket motors to anyone who wants to buy them within the rules globally. So some of the theories that were bounced around never made a heck of a lot of sense to me to be honest to you. We bought this company to sell engines and motors and that's what we're going to do. We'll be ready to hit the ground running on day one. We did have integration office with representatives from both teams. So a lot of time and effort on planning and, again, given the L3Harris merger, we had a playbook that we will use. This is obviously an acquisition, but every function, every decision has been made. We're ready to go on day one. So, thanks, Peter. Appreciate the kind comments.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSeth Seifman: Hey, thanks very much. Good morning everyone and, yeah, congratulations, Chris and Michelle. Maybe I'll just continue along the Aerojet line here. I guess, Chris, it kind of seems to me that the defense department has had a problem sourcing solid rocket motors and L3Harris has kind of raised their hand and volunteered to help solve that problem. So now it's going to get solved. And so, as you think about Aerojet, and we've seen various complaints from their customers over the years on kind of a perceived lack of investment, if you could talk to us about how you plan to address those issues, both from an operational standpoint and then from an investment standpoint, I think, we've all seen the $215 million that they got. I think that's focused primarily on GMLRS, Javelin and Stinger, but there's also Standard Missile, PAC-3, THAAD? So thinking about those programs as well and what the investment requirements are.\nChris Kubasik: Okay. No, again, thanks, Seth. Yeah, we did raise our hands, but to help. We had a pretty active M&A process and there were several companies or a handful of companies that we thought made a lot of sense. And one of those, of course, was the TDL line of ViaSat and of course Aerojet Rocketdyne. And as I've said before, and I know there was feedback, it was kind of unusual that both properties came to market in the same quarter. So it fits in strategically in my opinion. So we're always available to help the DoD, but the strategic rationale for Aerojet Rocketdyne continues to be entry into new markets. These are growth markets as you well know, with -- especially on the weapons side and it's well aligned with the government priorities, I already mentioned. From when we announced it to where we are today, significant increases in in the budget. And as you mentioned, the DPA money was over and above maybe what we had planned. So I think that makes a lot of sense. We've been impressed as we've gone out to the sites, with the talent and the skill of the workforce at these sites and as you would expect, the majority of those key individuals, hopefully all of them will be staying with the merger. And again, as of last night, the top 100 or so individuals we identified, over 98% have agreed to stay with the company. So I was excited to see that. I think hypersonics is going to be a capability that is very exciting. It doesn't get a whole lot of press, but longer term, when I look at where things are headed, I think the -- or soon to be our capability in hypersonics, that actually sounds pretty good. Our hypersonic capability is going to be a differentiator and I think continue to disrupt the market. We used to answer lots of questions about the backlog and whether we're short cycled, long cycled, but this clearly brings some long cycle backlog to L3Harris, gives us more earnings visibility. And the business case that we laid out back in December with accretion of EPS and free cash flow in the first full year and first full second year continue to remain in place or maybe slightly better. So relative to your question on operations, we obviously comply with the rules. There's this concept known as gun jumping, which is something you don't want to do. So we did not gun jump, which means we really couldn't get too involved in their businesses. But through the diligence process, we were able to engage with their team. They have a plan to go forward that we've reviewed. It's a real focus on deliveries and quality of critical missile programs. You mentioned a fair amount of those. And most of that surrounds the modernization of the Camden, Arkansas production operations and expanding production across other sites. And as you mentioned, the DPA, the $215 million, we've looked at that plan. That money will go mainly to those facilities and the programs you mentioned, but there\u2019s also money in there to digitize their engineering. So we're quite excited about that. So we've developed some tools since the merger to improve operations and processes. We utilize capability modeling, we have zero defect planning, just as a couple of examples. So we're going to take those processes and merge them into what Aerojet has and we'll be ready to hit the ground running on day one. We'll be at the key sites and we have a plan to execute. It's going to take some time you would imagine, but they're excited about the acquisition. We're excited about it. And in next 48 hours or so, we just want to close it and get ready to go from there. So, thanks, Seth.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Spingarn: Hi, good morning.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning.\nMichelle Turner: Hey, good morning.\nRobert Spingarn: Sticking with the topic at hand, I wanted to ask a financial question. Given that you've just updated guidance, but yet you're going to close this in the next day or two, I was wondering, Chris, if either you or Michelle could talk about the guidance with Aerojet included for the rest of the year both from a P&L perspective and then just maybe to follow on to Seth's question on the CapEx or investment perspective for the rest of '23? And then in that CapEx vein, how you think about that long term?\nMichelle Turner: Yeah. So I'll start, Rob. Good morning and thanks for joining. So as Chris pointed out, we're focused on closing the deal first and then welcoming all the new AeroJet employees for the day one celebratory event. So we certainly are going to get to the guide. We do plan to update the guidance in October for the five months remaining as part of our Q3 earnings call. And then of course for 2024, that'll part of our January update consistent with the rest of our portfolio. Once we have officially closed, we will be reviewing the forecasts and the assumptions, but high level, we do anticipate revenue to be around $1 billion for the remainder of the year, but we don't anticipate a material contribution to earnings as we anticipate the income contribution will offset the interest expense from the incremental debt. To Chris' point around the value creation, I do just want to remind everybody what we had shared previously which is consistent with where we stand today. EPS accretion within year one, along with free cash flow within year two.\nChris Kubasik: Again, I think we'll give more and more details at -- let\u2019s hit the next -- at the next earnings call. We will have two months of actual results, and we can give guidance for the remainder of the year, which of course is only three more months. And I think it's all about January of '24 when we give guidance for \u201824 for L3Harris. And this will be a separate segment, as we've said before, so you'll have visibility to growth and the profitability for all four segments. And I was going to mention this at the end, but I know there's several calls going on. So I'll just do it now. We are going to have a Investor Day in December, something that we've wanted to do, but we didn't want to schedule until we had confidence that the deal was going to close. So we'll get something out here in the weeks ahead on a date and a location. But at that time, we're going to give you a deeper insight to Aerojet Rocketdyne update and refresh how our Trusted Disruptor strategy is performing and then some of the other organic growth drivers that we have in our portfolio. So more to come, but we look forward to seeing hopefully everybody in person in December.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Harned: Good morning. Thank you.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning, Doug.\nDoug Harned: Yeah, I want to switch gears a little bit here. When -- if you look at where a lot of things are going right now in DoD and elsewhere, with the TDL acquisition, in principle, having Link 16 combined with other assets you've got in comms, space, IMS, it should put you in a pretty interesting position to provide some really integrated system solutions. Now, I'm just interested in how you see the opportunity there, how large could that be if in fact you see that? And then trying to -- assuming you do, trying to make that work, how do you go after something when this is a company that historically you've operated in many small silos as businesses and this would involve really an integrated approach that I don't think we've seen so much in the past here?\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Well, thanks, Doug. Yeah, a lot of questions there. Look, I think the bottom line here is the TDL acquisition is really looking better than maybe we had expected. It's probably too early to declare success, but we're off to a real strong start. I'll just pick up on the operations first and then get to your more strategic question. But part of the plan was to integrate and move the production to Salt Lake City, where we have our BCS, Broadband Communication Systems, sector headquartered, which will co-locate these properties. So as of today, we've actually moved more than half of the production lines successfully. We're slightly ahead of schedule, which is always good. And we've already built first articles with no issues related to the production lines that we've moved. So we kind of expected that to be the case, but it's never easy to move a production line or several production lines, but that's going better than planned and actually more employees have agreed to relocate than we had planned for, which I think is contributing to the success. Sam Mehta, our segment President, and I will be out there next week for a few days and topics you're talking about are clearly on the agenda. I think on an integrated approach, our company does this probably better than anyone. We've had some successes over the last year or so on some significant classified programs, on Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, on SPEAR for the Navy and each and every one of these have in excess of seven or eight different L3Harris entities working collaboratively across multiple segments. So we think all the challenges the companies have working internally, whether it's the internal accounting, the cost transfer, who gets credit for the bonuses, all the reasons why people have a hard time working collaboratively, we've been able to fix. And I think that's really set us up well for exactly what you're talking about. I mean, the customer interest has been very, very strong. And most of the discussions have focused on how we integrate the BCS waveforms with the Link 16 capabilities. We talked about Link 16 having the footprint in over 20,000 platforms. So the boxes to put it crudely are already there and it's just a matter of taking those capabilities and integrating them and then also possibly enhancing the Link 16 capabilities. I think, while that sounds like a lot of words, what we were excited about and we put in the investor letter is that near the end of the quarter, we won, specifically TDL, a $150 million competitive Prime award for MIDS, and MIDS is the Multifunctional Information Distribution System as part of the Joint Tactical Radio program. This was the largest production order ever. It's about three times larger than anything we've ever received. And I think that's tangible example of the customer excitement and the capabilities. Obviously, we have strong backlog as a result of that order in that one business. And as I said, I couldn't be more pleased with this acquisition and still more to do, but everything is looking good so far. So hopefully that helps, Doug.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Sure. Good morning, Chris and Michelle. Thank you. I want to ask specifics on margins in the quarter and how we think about the second half. So I guess first up on Q2, CS performance was pretty good, tracking ahead of your full year. How do we think about mix benefits, the normalization of supply chain and the sustainability of 25% plus margins in CS? And then additionally, if you could dig into the operational items within IMS and what drives the sequential step-up in the second half? Thank you.\nMichelle Turner: Good morning, Sheila, and thanks for the question. So I will start with our overall enterprise margins and then peel the onion a bit from a segment perspective because there's a lot of good work that's happening across the portfolio. So to your point, our Q2 margins did come in at 14.8%. This is a 50 basis point improvement from Q1. And I just want to note that this is also consistent with what we've previously communicated in terms of sequential margin improvement expected throughout the year. And this will land us in a place from our updated guidance of getting us to our 15% expectations, which again continues to be industry-leading in terms of margin performance. One thing I want to highlight from a overall portfolio perspective is, key to this result within Q1 and it's also going to drag over the last couple of years is our overall EAC performance. And this is important because 75% of our portfolio is driven by programs, right, which is driven by EACs. And so it impacts our bottom line So aligned with this, Q2 was the first quarter that we saw our EAC trend trajectory start to improve since the second half of 2021. So you may recall this is when the macro environment challenges started across all industries. It started to permeate within supply chain, then we saw the issues with labor and inflation that permeated throughout 2022. And so where we sit today, specifically within CS, and kudos to Sam Mehta and the CS team delivered really strong margins within the quarter, a 200 basis point improvement from Q1, really driven by all the resilient supply chain actions that we've taken. You've heard us talk about this over the last 12 to 18 months, but also the easing of the electronic component shortages and we also have the benefit of increased software mix within the quarter. So really strong delivery for Q2. As we look at full year, we expect second half for CS to be consistent with the first half with Q3 being a bit lighter in terms of domestic mix with that ramping within fourth quarter. From a IMS perspective, we did continue to see an impact from increased domestic ISR mix. This, along with some operational challenges on fixed price development programs at a couple of our remote sites permeated and had an impact within the quarter. Jon Rambeau and our IMS team are addressing these issues. They are predominantly related to talent and learning loss inefficiencies and we expect the results of these actions to have a positive impact as we progress towards the end of the year. In regards to the second half ramp, again, this is consistent in terms of the initial guidance that we laid out, but it's really driven by two things. One is around this continual improvement in terms of EAC performance. As I noted, we saw this start to trend upward within Q2. We expect that trend to continue as we are working through that fixed price backlog that has been impacted by these macro issues over the last 12 to 18 months. And the second is driven by our product deliveries. Consistent with what we've experienced in the past, we expect our product deliveries to be higher in the second half, high single digits, which is going to be able to deliver on the margin expectations. The other thing I would note is within Q4, we do have a higher mix of our international product sales and so you'll see this play out both within TCOM and Wescam. So from a modeling perspective, expect that fourth quarter margins are going to be better than Q3.\nChris Kubasik: I'll just chime in. I think we try to highlight within IMS, the challenges on these few select programs were within the ISR and the maritime sectors. I will say that there continues to be a lot of demand for those products and capabilities. We do a fair amount of undersea test ranges for the US Navy and we've been successful in winning work just recently for the similar capability in Australia. We've talked about Compass Call here for the US Air Force. There's similar capabilities for a European country that will be mainly focused on modernizing the aircraft, which will have higher margins since the aircraft have already been procured. We're continuing to pursue undersea test range and sensing capability here in the US Navy, kind of a follow-on to something that we started winning four or five years ago. We've talked about the business jets and the strategy years ago to start missionizing business jets. We have an opportunity to far east, we have another opportunity in Europe. And then here in the US, you saw that we won the ATHENA-R program, which we're very excited about. I think the other day we announced that we're teaming with another OEM on ATHENA-S. We'd kind of hope to win one of the two and now we're going to go two for two. And then the Army has a program known as HADES, which could be up to 10 aircraft. So there's a lot of opportunities and how I want to tie this back to the margins is IMS has the longer cycle backlog relative to the other businesses, say, CS in particular. They have a lot of fixed price contract, probably some fixed price development programs, which I think I've publicly said we're really going to be selective on bidding going forward, especially when the customer is asking for a fixed price production or low rate production, simultaneous with development, that's just bad business and makes no sense and we're going to continue to push back and not bid those because very hard to price something that you haven't developed. But I have discussions on that topic regularly with our customers and we will continue to no-bid those until the contracting vehicle is appropriate. So I throw that in that some of these challenges which Michelle laid out well is really the lagging effect of attrition and inflation because of the long cycle business. We've taken those lessons that we've learned or we've more bluntly or clearly updated these bids based on the latest performance, the latest cost. So every single program I mentioned is double digit and sometimes more than double digit margins or higher double digit. So we'll get those wins, we'll get those in backlog that gives me confidence that we'll be able to improve the margins in IMS with Jon and his team.\nMichelle Turner: Yeah. The only other thing I would add to that is just as a reminder, when we set out our guidance this year, we were purposeful of not including any international buying or events, we still have a strong pipeline that we're chasing there, just the recognition that we know we've disappointed historically when we put those in and then not been able to get them over the goal line because of their timing constraints. And so we continue to have a strong backlog there with our pipeline as we look into 2024 and beyond.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question.\nPete Skibitski: Hey, good morning, guys.\nMichelle Turner: Good morning.\nPete Skibitski: Chris, I was wondering if you could add more color on strong first half book-to-bill at space in particular. And I know you guys have obviously done well with some of the low earth orbit awards, but seems like there's a lot of other things going on for you in space as well. So wondering if you could talk more about what you're winning there and kind of your approach, how you're winning it and how big the opportunity set is there?\nChris Kubasik: Yeah. Thanks, Pete. We talk about this Trusted Disruptor strategy at the L3Harris level. And as you would expect, it really flows down to each and every one of the sectors. And I mentioned we have 14 sectors When we close Aerojet Rocketdyne, we'll be up to 16 sectors as they'll have two sectors within that segment. But it's hard to think of a better example than maybe space where they've really been able to embrace this strategy and execute upon it. And at the highest level, we talk about doing more prime work with the end users, being more innovative, being more agile. I know it just sounds like buzzwords, but it's clearly working in space. And to back it up, at the time of the merger, we had five satellites, mainly experimental demo satellites under contract. And today, we have over 50 contracts for satellites. I mean, that's a 10x in four years, which I think reinforces to what's implied in your question that what we're doing is working. We actually have two classified operational constellations. Again, five years ago, we didn't have any. We might have had parts on other people's satellites on their constellation. So we really have disrupted this market and we're viewed as a prime and a legitimate competitor and we're winning and we're performing. We've invested a fair amount in R&D to get us in this position in capital. We're actually facilitating, we have two facilities, one in Fort Wayne, Indiana that we expanded and one here down in Palm Bay, Florida satellite manufacturing. So we're investing capital for growth, which will allow us to continue to perform. I mean, just since the merger, our revenue is up in space alone over 50%. We have record backlog, we have solid execution. We can always do better. We've had some challenges with certain suppliers. We don't call anybody out by name, but we just kind of work with those -- with those companies to bring them along. So in the space world, it all comes down to launches. We have a bunch of launches coming up in October and that's where the money hits the road. We're excited about a launch we have, the co-manifested payloads, both our SDA tranche 0 satellites will be going up with the MDA's HBTSS satellite. So I think that worked out real well. Upcoming opportunities, we do a lot of work going back decades for NOAA for their weather satellites, about $700 million opportunity coming up this year. We feel really good about that. It's called the sounder program. As always, a lot of classified opportunities, which I know is never satisfying for you and others to hear, Pete, but they are there. The SDA tranche 2 for tracking, the RFP is coming out. So we'll be prepared to respond there. And I think at the end of the day, you hear me talk a lot about prioritization and aligning with customers' needs. Secretary Kendall at the Air Force, their number one operating imperative is all about space. So we have the mission sets. We have the phenomenologies. We've adapted to the rapid acquisition process and we've been quite successful. So couldn't be more proud of the team. And it's just one example where the strategy has been laid out, it's been executed and it's working. So, more to come.\nMichelle Turner: I would just add to that, because along with the top-line, this team is also fully embracing our performance-first initiative. They're also driving really strong cash performance as well. So nine day working capital improvement within -- from Q1 to Q2. And so kudos to Ed and Kelly in the space team because it's -- sometimes it's easier to grow the top-line without doing the cash along with it and they fully embraced all the financial metrics to really drive this business.\nMark Kratz: Rob, in the interest of time and to stop at 40 minutes, we'll go ahead and take the last question this morning.\nOperator: Our final question is from Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nMyles Walton: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Chris, I wanted to ask about TDL, at the sales and the margin side, I think the sales year-to-date since you've rounded it down [about 10%] (ph), did the MIDS contract you mentioned turn that around, get you back above a $400 million sort of run rate where you acquired it? And then on the margin side, if I strip out some of the market loss making contracts, the margins look a bit light. Is there a case for a significant margin expansion once those MIDS drop in? Thanks.\nChris Kubasik: Yeah. Thanks, Myles. Good questions. Yeah, we see a path to $400 million or more of revenue for TDL. It was a little bit of a slower start. But with the MIDS win I mentioned and some of the other opportunities we're pursuing, we definitely see a second half ramp coming with MIDS. I think this is lot number 11. So it's been a long production cycle as we've mentioned, a long legacy program. And I think same, similarly on the margins. As part of the move, we're going to have some efficiencies, not only in labor, but overhead and facilities. So we'll start to see the synergies, if you will, kick in and further upward margin potential. And again, this will all be mainly in our Salt Lake City. It's all about base and the ability to win new programs. I'll also throw in there that one of my programs, I've talked about for years Next Gen Jammer, that work would be done in Salt Lake City as well. And that's been a several year process as you know. There was an independent review team that finally came out with their report with no substantive changes. We've turned in our proposal and we're hoping to hear by the end of September. So I just throw that in Myles because it's in the same facility and gives us a larger base, if you will, to absorb the overhead, thereby creating other opportunities for margin expansion. So thank you very much.\nChris Kubasik: I guess with that, we'll just wrap up the call. Again, apologies to cut it a little bit short, but Mark and his team will be available all day. And, Michelle and I have to go work some acquisition related tasks as I hope you can appreciate. So thanks for dialing in. And again, we'll get you more information about the Investor Day in December and have a great rest of the week. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Chris Kubasik",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Yesterday marked a significant milestone for L3Harris in our acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Our investor letter disclosed that the FTC will not block our acquisition. This is one of the final closing conditions for the transaction, and we are moving forward to close in the next day or so. I look forward to extending a warm welcome to Aerojet's team of over 5,000 employees who will soon become part of L3Harris. This acquisition represents a pivotal moment for both our company and the defense industry and is poised to generate shareholder value beyond initial expectations. Budgets are increasing for munitions, and the DoD has committed DPA, Defense Production Act, funding for the expansion and modernization of Aerojet Rocketdyne's operations. Upon closing, this acquisition will strengthen the defense industrial base, foster healthy competition and accelerate innovation in support of the war fighter. In conjunction with this exciting news, we continue to focus on execution across the enterprise and have delivered on our financial commitments again in second quarter. Our results reflect the momentum we have been building over the last year, as the team delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of top-line growth which accelerated to 13% with increases in each segment. We don't talk much about our sectors, but 13 of the 14 grew their top-line in Q2 and 13 of 14 had a book-to-bill greater than 1.0. This gives me confidence that we've been investing in the right technologies, and we are aligned with customer priorities. Operating income was up 7% and margins expanded 50 basis points sequentially as we had anticipated. In total, we delivered earnings of $2.95 -- $2.97 per share, ahead of consensus and free cash flow was positive, in line with prior commentary at over $300 million. Given our performance to-date, we are increasing revenue and EPS guidance for the year and reiterating our free cash flow commitment. With easing supply chain constraints, operational improvement initiatives, and accelerating sequential growth in product-centric businesses, we remain focused on delivering second half results for 2023. With that, let's open the line for questions, Rob. Okay. Well, thanks Peter. Just as a reminder, we announced -- signed and announced the deal back in December. We received our second request in mid-March. And here we are 7.5 months later, ready to close the transaction. So it really was a great team effort. I'm not sure everyone appreciates how much time and effort it takes to go through that process. So a special call-out to the L3Harris team, because all because this was in addition to their day jobs. The IT organization going back years, searching emails, text, legal, finance, contracts and a lot of our external partners. So very proud of the team to be where we are in a relatively pretty -- pretty short period of time. It was a very thorough review by the FTC as you can imagine and obviously the DoD, Department of Defense, would have had some input. So we responded to all inquiries and we are where we are today. So we put out that announcement as the -- as the waiting period has expired yesterday. Over the next day or so, we have to finalize the financing and then close the transaction. And I think we're going to be in a good shape to hit the ground running. Relative to your question about the consent agreement, we did not negotiate or sign a consent agreement. We gave assurances to the DoD that we would be a merchant supplier of rocket motors and rocket engines We have a long legacy of being a merchant supplier and we'll continue with that model once we close Aerojet Rocketdyne. I can assure you we are highly motivated to sell rocket engines and rocket motors to anyone who wants to buy them within the rules globally. So some of the theories that were bounced around never made a heck of a lot of sense to me to be honest to you. We bought this company to sell engines and motors and that's what we're going to do. We'll be ready to hit the ground running on day one. We did have integration office with representatives from both teams. So a lot of time and effort on planning and, again, given the L3Harris merger, we had a playbook that we will use. This is obviously an acquisition, but every function, every decision has been made. We're ready to go on day one. So, thanks, Peter. Appreciate the kind comments. Okay. No, again, thanks, Seth. Yeah, we did raise our hands, but to help. We had a pretty active M&A process and there were several companies or a handful of companies that we thought made a lot of sense. And one of those, of course, was the TDL line of ViaSat and of course Aerojet Rocketdyne. And as I've said before, and I know there was feedback, it was kind of unusual that both properties came to market in the same quarter. So it fits in strategically in my opinion. So we're always available to help the DoD, but the strategic rationale for Aerojet Rocketdyne continues to be entry into new markets. These are growth markets as you well know, with -- especially on the weapons side and it's well aligned with the government priorities, I already mentioned. From when we announced it to where we are today, significant increases in in the budget. And as you mentioned, the DPA money was over and above maybe what we had planned. So I think that makes a lot of sense. We've been impressed as we've gone out to the sites, with the talent and the skill of the workforce at these sites and as you would expect, the majority of those key individuals, hopefully all of them will be staying with the merger. And again, as of last night, the top 100 or so individuals we identified, over 98% have agreed to stay with the company. So I was excited to see that. I think hypersonics is going to be a capability that is very exciting. It doesn't get a whole lot of press, but longer term, when I look at where things are headed, I think the -- or soon to be our capability in hypersonics, that actually sounds pretty good. Our hypersonic capability is going to be a differentiator and I think continue to disrupt the market. We used to answer lots of questions about the backlog and whether we're short cycled, long cycled, but this clearly brings some long cycle backlog to L3Harris, gives us more earnings visibility. And the business case that we laid out back in December with accretion of EPS and free cash flow in the first full year and first full second year continue to remain in place or maybe slightly better. So relative to your question on operations, we obviously comply with the rules. There's this concept known as gun jumping, which is something you don't want to do. So we did not gun jump, which means we really couldn't get too involved in their businesses. But through the diligence process, we were able to engage with their team. They have a plan to go forward that we've reviewed. It's a real focus on deliveries and quality of critical missile programs. You mentioned a fair amount of those. And most of that surrounds the modernization of the Camden, Arkansas production operations and expanding production across other sites. And as you mentioned, the DPA, the $215 million, we've looked at that plan. That money will go mainly to those facilities and the programs you mentioned, but there's also money in there to digitize their engineering. So we're quite excited about that. So we've developed some tools since the merger to improve operations and processes. We utilize capability modeling, we have zero defect planning, just as a couple of examples. So we're going to take those processes and merge them into what Aerojet has and we'll be ready to hit the ground running on day one. We'll be at the key sites and we have a plan to execute. It's going to take some time you would imagine, but they're excited about the acquisition. We're excited about it. And in next 48 hours or so, we just want to close it and get ready to go from there. So, thanks, Seth. Good morning. Again, I think we'll give more and more details at -- let's hit the next -- at the next earnings call. We will have two months of actual results, and we can give guidance for the remainder of the year, which of course is only three more months. And I think it's all about January of '24 when we give guidance for \u201824 for L3Harris. And this will be a separate segment, as we've said before, so you'll have visibility to growth and the profitability for all four segments. And I was going to mention this at the end, but I know there's several calls going on. So I'll just do it now. We are going to have a Investor Day in December, something that we've wanted to do, but we didn't want to schedule until we had confidence that the deal was going to close. So we'll get something out here in the weeks ahead on a date and a location. But at that time, we're going to give you a deeper insight to Aerojet Rocketdyne update and refresh how our Trusted Disruptor strategy is performing and then some of the other organic growth drivers that we have in our portfolio. So more to come, but we look forward to seeing hopefully everybody in person in December. Good morning, Doug. Okay. Well, thanks, Doug. Yeah, a lot of questions there. Look, I think the bottom line here is the TDL acquisition is really looking better than maybe we had expected. It's probably too early to declare success, but we're off to a real strong start. I'll just pick up on the operations first and then get to your more strategic question. But part of the plan was to integrate and move the production to Salt Lake City, where we have our BCS, Broadband Communication Systems, sector headquartered, which will co-locate these properties. So as of today, we've actually moved more than half of the production lines successfully. We're slightly ahead of schedule, which is always good. And we've already built first articles with no issues related to the production lines that we've moved. So we kind of expected that to be the case, but it's never easy to move a production line or several production lines, but that's going better than planned and actually more employees have agreed to relocate than we had planned for, which I think is contributing to the success. Sam Mehta, our segment President, and I will be out there next week for a few days and topics you're talking about are clearly on the agenda. I think on an integrated approach, our company does this probably better than anyone. We've had some successes over the last year or so on some significant classified programs, on Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, on SPEAR for the Navy and each and every one of these have in excess of seven or eight different L3Harris entities working collaboratively across multiple segments. So we think all the challenges the companies have working internally, whether it's the internal accounting, the cost transfer, who gets credit for the bonuses, all the reasons why people have a hard time working collaboratively, we've been able to fix. And I think that's really set us up well for exactly what you're talking about. I mean, the customer interest has been very, very strong. And most of the discussions have focused on how we integrate the BCS waveforms with the Link 16 capabilities. We talked about Link 16 having the footprint in over 20,000 platforms. So the boxes to put it crudely are already there and it's just a matter of taking those capabilities and integrating them and then also possibly enhancing the Link 16 capabilities. I think, while that sounds like a lot of words, what we were excited about and we put in the investor letter is that near the end of the quarter, we won, specifically TDL, a $150 million competitive Prime award for MIDS, and MIDS is the Multifunctional Information Distribution System as part of the Joint Tactical Radio program. This was the largest production order ever. It's about three times larger than anything we've ever received. And I think that's tangible example of the customer excitement and the capabilities. Obviously, we have strong backlog as a result of that order in that one business. And as I said, I couldn't be more pleased with this acquisition and still more to do, but everything is looking good so far. So hopefully that helps, Doug. I'll just chime in. I think we try to highlight within IMS, the challenges on these few select programs were within the ISR and the maritime sectors. I will say that there continues to be a lot of demand for those products and capabilities. We do a fair amount of undersea test ranges for the US Navy and we've been successful in winning work just recently for the similar capability in Australia. We've talked about Compass Call here for the US Air Force. There's similar capabilities for a European country that will be mainly focused on modernizing the aircraft, which will have higher margins since the aircraft have already been procured. We're continuing to pursue undersea test range and sensing capability here in the US Navy, kind of a follow-on to something that we started winning four or five years ago. We've talked about the business jets and the strategy years ago to start missionizing business jets. We have an opportunity to far east, we have another opportunity in Europe. And then here in the US, you saw that we won the ATHENA-R program, which we're very excited about. I think the other day we announced that we're teaming with another OEM on ATHENA-S. We'd kind of hope to win one of the two and now we're going to go two for two. And then the Army has a program known as HADES, which could be up to 10 aircraft. So there's a lot of opportunities and how I want to tie this back to the margins is IMS has the longer cycle backlog relative to the other businesses, say, CS in particular. They have a lot of fixed price contract, probably some fixed price development programs, which I think I've publicly said we're really going to be selective on bidding going forward, especially when the customer is asking for a fixed price production or low rate production, simultaneous with development, that's just bad business and makes no sense and we're going to continue to push back and not bid those because very hard to price something that you haven't developed. But I have discussions on that topic regularly with our customers and we will continue to no-bid those until the contracting vehicle is appropriate. So I throw that in that some of these challenges which Michelle laid out well is really the lagging effect of attrition and inflation because of the long cycle business. We've taken those lessons that we've learned or we've more bluntly or clearly updated these bids based on the latest performance, the latest cost. So every single program I mentioned is double digit and sometimes more than double digit margins or higher double digit. So we'll get those wins, we'll get those in backlog that gives me confidence that we'll be able to improve the margins in IMS with Jon and his team. Yeah. Thanks, Pete. We talk about this Trusted Disruptor strategy at the L3Harris level. And as you would expect, it really flows down to each and every one of the sectors. And I mentioned we have 14 sectors When we close Aerojet Rocketdyne, we'll be up to 16 sectors as they'll have two sectors within that segment. But it's hard to think of a better example than maybe space where they've really been able to embrace this strategy and execute upon it. And at the highest level, we talk about doing more prime work with the end users, being more innovative, being more agile. I know it just sounds like buzzwords, but it's clearly working in space. And to back it up, at the time of the merger, we had five satellites, mainly experimental demo satellites under contract. And today, we have over 50 contracts for satellites.

So we really have disrupted this market and we're viewed as a prime and a legitimate competitor and we're winning and we're performing. We've invested a fair amount in R&D to get us in this position in capital. We're actually facilitating, we have two facilities, one in Fort Wayne, Indiana that we expanded and one here down in Palm Bay, Florida satellite manufacturing. So we're investing capital for growth, which will allow us to continue to perform. I mean, just since the merger, our revenue is up in space alone over 50%. We have record backlog, we have solid execution. We can always do better. We've had some challenges with certain suppliers. We don't call anybody out by name, but we just kind of work with those -- with those companies to bring them along. So in the space world, it all comes down to launches. We have a bunch of launches coming up in October and that's where the money hits the road.

And it's just one example where the strategy has been laid out, it's been executed and it's working. So, more to come. Yeah. Thanks, Myles. Good questions. Yeah, we see a path to $400 million or more of revenue for TDL. It was a little bit of a slower start. But with the MIDS win I mentioned and some of the other opportunities we're pursuing, we definitely see a second half ramp coming with MIDS. I think this is lot number 11. So it's been a long production cycle as we've mentioned, a long legacy program. And I think same, similarly on the margins. As part of the move, we're going to have some efficiencies, not only in labor, but overhead and facilities.

            "name": "Michelle Turner",
            "content": "Hey, good morning. Yeah. So I'll start, Rob. Good morning and thanks for joining. So as Chris pointed out, we're focused on closing the deal first and then welcoming all the new AeroJet employees for the day one celebratory event. So we certainly are going to get to the guide. We do plan to update the guidance in October for the five months remaining as part of our Q3 earnings call. And then of course for 2024, that'll part of our January update consistent with the rest of our portfolio. Once we have officially closed, we will be reviewing the forecasts and the assumptions, but high level, we do anticipate revenue to be around $1 billion for the remainder of the year, but we don't anticipate a material contribution to earnings as we anticipate the income contribution will offset the interest expense from the incremental debt. To Chris' point around the value creation, I do just want to remind everybody what we had shared previously which is consistent with where we stand today. EPS accretion within year one, along with free cash flow within year two. Good morning, Sheila, and thanks for the question. So I will start with our overall enterprise margins and then peel the onion a bit from a segment perspective because there's a lot of good work that's happening across the portfolio. So to your point, our Q2 margins did come in at 14.8%. This is a 50 basis point improvement from Q1. And I just want to note that this is also consistent with what we've previously communicated in terms of sequential margin improvement expected throughout the year. And this will land us in a place from our updated guidance of getting us to our 15% expectations, which again continues to be industry-leading in terms of margin performance. One thing I want to highlight from a overall portfolio perspective is, key to this result within Q1 and it's also going to drag over the last couple of years is our overall EAC performance. And this is important because 75% of our portfolio is driven by programs, right, which is driven by EACs. And so it impacts our bottom line So aligned with this, Q2 was the first quarter that we saw our EAC trend trajectory start to improve since the second half of 2021. So you may recall this is when the macro environment challenges started across all industries. It started to permeate within supply chain, then we saw the issues with labor and inflation that permeated throughout 2022. And so where we sit today, specifically within CS, and kudos to Sam Mehta and the CS team delivered really strong margins within the quarter, a 200 basis point improvement from Q1, really driven by all the resilient supply chain actions that we've taken. You've heard us talk about this over the last 12 to 18 months, but also the easing of the electronic component shortages and we also have the benefit of increased software mix within the quarter. So really strong delivery for Q2. As we look at full year, we expect second half for CS to be consistent with the first half with Q3 being a bit lighter in terms of domestic mix with that ramping within fourth quarter. From a IMS perspective, we did continue to see an impact from increased domestic ISR mix. This, along with some operational challenges on fixed price development programs at a couple of our remote sites permeated and had an impact within the quarter. Jon Rambeau and our IMS team are addressing these issues. They are predominantly related to talent and learning loss inefficiencies and we expect the results of these actions to have a positive impact as we progress towards the end of the year. In regards to the second half ramp, again, this is consistent in terms of the initial guidance that we laid out, but it's really driven by two things. One is around this continual improvement in terms of EAC performance. As I noted, we saw this start to trend upward within Q2. We expect that trend to continue as we are working through that fixed price backlog that has been impacted by these macro issues over the last 12 to 18 months. And the second is driven by our product deliveries. Consistent with what we've experienced in the past, we expect our product deliveries to be higher in the second half, high single digits, which is going to be able to deliver on the margin expectations. The other thing I would note is within Q4, we do have a higher mix of our international product sales and so you'll see this play out both within TCOM and Wescam. So from a modeling perspective, expect that fourth quarter margins are going to be better than Q3. Yeah. The only other thing I would add to that is just as a reminder, when we set out our guidance this year, we were purposeful of not including any international buying or events, we still have a strong pipeline that we're chasing there, just the recognition that we know we've disappointed historically when we put those in and then not been able to get them over the goal line because of their timing constraints. And so we continue to have a strong backlog there with our pipeline as we look into 2024 and beyond. Good morning. I would just add to that, because along with the top-line, this team is also fully embracing our performance-first initiative. They're also driving really strong cash performance as well. So nine day working capital improvement within -- from Q1 to Q2. And so kudos to Ed and Kelly in the space team because it's -- sometimes it's easier to grow the top-line without doing the cash along with it and they fully embraced all the financial metrics to really drive this business."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mark Kratz, Vice president, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may now begin.\nMark Kratz: Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to today's call. Joining me are Chris Kubasik, our CEO, and Michelle Turner, our CFO. During our discussion, we may reference our Investor Letter that we published on our website yesterday. We're listening to investor feedback and have made some enhancements. Given the detail on this letter, this call will primarily be focused on answering questions. We may also discuss certain matters that constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please reference the Safe Harbor provision found in the Investor letter and our SEC filings. Lastly, we will frequently discuss non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled to comparable GAAP measures in the Investor Letter. Before moving to questions, I'd like to turn it over to Chris for some opening remarks.\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Good morning and thanks, Mark, and welcome aboard. We've been focusing on execution under our Performance First imperative and I'm pleased with our results. The first quarter was strong in many respects as we continue to build momentum with our trusted disruptor strategy, resulting in record orders and record backlog, improving macro trends serve as a positive backdrop, including the President's 2024 budget request released to Congress in March. We are well aligned with the priorities in the National Defense Strategy, which is reflected in robust funding and major areas for us, including space and joint force capabilities as well as missiles and munitions given our pending acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Our goal for Q1 was to grow the top line, meet the EPS number and have positive cash flow. The team rallied and delivered on all counts. For a third consecutive quarter, we had top line growth, a 9% increase with each segment growing. Operating income was up in two of the three segments, despite the usual headwinds. However, we came in line with where we thought we would be to begin the year. This resulted in EPS of $2.86 and we anticipate building from there. Free cash flow came in at over 300 million, a significant improvement from a year ago and we also front loaded our share repurchase commitment for the year. We received a second request from the FTC in March, which was followed by the Aerojet Rocketdyne shareholder approval vote the following day. Both of these outcomes were expected and we are responding to the FTC. We still anticipate the deal will close later this year. First quarter results are differentiated winning strategy and the overall business environment led us to reaffirm our 2023 guidance with the recognition that record orders and strong revenue growth to date could support a bias towards the higher end of our revenue guidance range should these trends continue. We still have work to do on profitability, but with abating macro headwinds, operational improvement initiatives and accelerating sequential growth in product centric businesses, we remain committed to our full year EPS guidance. So we're off to a strong start and I'd like to recognize our employees for continuing to prioritize Performance First in everything they do. With that, let's open the lines for questions, Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Akers: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to put maybe a finer point on the Rocketdyne timing. Have you I guess substantially complied with the FTC's second request you had, If not, sort of how much is left there? I think that's what starts the clock for that review.\nChris Kubasik: Yeah. Matt. Thanks for the question. We're gathering the data as you would anticipate. It's usually about a three to four month process. So we got the second request mid-March. So that would kind of suggest a June submission both for us and I know Aerojet Rocketdyne is doing the same thing. I have a feeling they'll probably submit a little earlier than us, given they've already done this, done this once. So, you know, the reason I'm confident in the 2023 close really comes down to the FTC's evaluation of this transaction. And, you know, when we look at it, we do not compete with Aerojet Rocketdyne. I mean, plain and simple, they make rocket motors and rocket engines and we do not. And that term is known as horizontal competitiveness. And there is none. We are not a customer of theirs. They are not a customer of ours, which is the term of art, the FTC and lawyers uses vertical competition. So I look at this and say, if there's no vertical competition and no horizontal competition, we'll submit the data, we'll certify the information, and we'll let the process run. You know, I think I'll just take a minute since I'm not sure I'll get any more Aerojet questions today. And I just think there's an incredible amount of confusion, mainly in DC, whether it's the DOD, the FTC or Members of Congress, and there are three terms that are used interchangeably that mean completely different things, and that is consolidation, merger and acquisition. And consolidation, in my opinion, is when two companies with similar capabilities combine and I think back 25 years to McDonnell Douglas and Boeing and they consolidated and nobody can dispute that after that transaction closed, there was one less commercial and military aircraft provider. And that's not what we're talking about today. A merger. I think a good example is obviously L3 and Harris. Two companies that are complementary, came together, which is now why we have capabilities and space, air, land, sea and cyber domains, significant revenue synergies, significant cost synergies over 650 million of cost savings that we shared with our shareholders and the DOD and resulted in a stronger company, in this case, providing more competition within the defense industrial base. And then Aerojet Rocketdyne is an acquisition. It's about 10% of our enterprise value. It's all cash. It's putting us into new markets that I mentioned already that we believe are growth markets as high? That I mentioned already that we believe are growth markets as highlighted in some of the recent budget decisions and fills in a gap in our portfolio. So I just felt I wanted to clarify that point and that is what gives me confidence that this deal will close in the second half of '23.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your quest0ion.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. Good morning, Chris and Michelle and Mark. Welcome to the call. Chris, good seeing you on CNBC last night. I know they let anyone on these days. So nice that they got an upgrade with you. But in all seriousness, good quarter. And you called out space in addition to Aerojet on that segment. Your space business, 1.5 billion of new prime space awards. What types of opportunities are you seeing in the market? And has there been a shift in the competitive backdrop given some of the moves to smaller space systems? And then where do you think LHX is gaining share? And tied to that, there were a number of international awards within Space. Is there a shift in the dynamics that you're seeing just given space has become more open to the US working with allies?\nChris Kubasik: Okay. Well, thank you, Sheila. I was actually in Clifton, New Jersey all day with our electronic warfare team. So just a short drive to get on TV. So thank you. Thank you for that. You know, let me kind of kick this off and then I'll ask Michelle to give a little more detail. And I really want to step back and think of space and the space domain and how it aligns with the strategy that we've been talking about since the merger. So a few fun facts that the date of the merger there were actually zero L3Harris or legacy company satellites in orbit. Today, there are seven that we have built, obviously, as a prime and we have 33 in backlog as a prime that will be launched over the next couple of years. So when we look back, we saw this as a growth market several years ago, which it is. We invested R&D and capital and facilities and tooling to position ourselves for growth. And the discussion aligned with what we've been saying for several years was to move up the food chain and become a prime by providing disruptive technologies and alternatives to our customers. And I think as we sit here today, we can see that that strategy, that investment is starting to payoff. We're probably best known recently for the work we're doing with the Missile Defense Agency and the Space Development Agency launches that will be coming up in the next year or so. But we're also a market leader in weather and ISR and also space exploration. And I appreciate you highlighting the fact that we're growing internationally as well. You don't always think of space as an international growth opportunity, but the team has a global reputation of delivering on time and having quality products, and we're seeing that being recognized around the globe. So, Michelle, do you want to maybe give more detail?\nMichelle Turner: Yeah. So I'll add some color in terms of our strategy and action and some of the numbers, Sheila. So thanks for highlighting this. So over the last six months we have submitted over 7 billion in space proposals, booking a billion and a half within Q1. So we're super excited about this book-to-bill over 2.0 within this sector. Kelly and her team are doing an amazing job in terms of recognizing the current environment within the US. But also to your point, Sheila, around expanding the aperture in terms of international exposure as well. Half of the -- billion and a half in bookings are international in nature. And so when we think about margins within this space, this is where Kelly and the team are thinking differently in terms of leveraging our domestic footprint to be able to drive shareholder value in a different way across the globe. So we're excited about this double-digit growth from a revenue perspective. We expect this to continue to be a tailwind for us within '23 and beyond.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nKristine Liwag: Hey, good morning, Chris, Michelle and Mark. Chris, on the supply chain. It's encouraging to see that the market conditions for electronic components are improving. Your critical parts shortage is declining and alternate parts are increasing. So is this tracking better or worse or as you expected? And if we continue to see the supply chain improvement accelerate, could we see upside to your full year guide beyond the upper end?\nChris Kubasik: Yeah. Thanks, Kristine. I believe the worst is behind us relative to all the macro headwinds we've talked about supply chain attrition and inflation. But to your question specifically on supply chain, you know, I'm proud of the team because these alternative parts just don't happen. We took a fair amount of talent and expense to redesign our products, if you will, design for availability. And the team has done an amazing job. And as we highlighted in our letter, we now have 1300 alternative parts that weren't originally designed into our products. So that's been able to allow us to grow. As you saw in the quarter and maybe position us for continued growth for the rest of the year. I think after the last few years, I hate to predict anything because it's hard to predict what's going to happen day to day or month to month. But I feel real good about the opportunities and the positioning. And we referenced, you know, we've signed a strategic agreement with a major microelectronic chip providing company. The benefit for us is it gives us assured availability and kind of moves us up and out of the allocation process, which is always an uncertainty kind of day by day. And in exchange for that, you know, we're sitting down and sharing with them our technology roadmap and working collaboratively as we design new products, taking advantage of some of their more advanced technologies. So long way of saying we're happy with the first quarter. We have good visibility for Q2 and beyond. And you know, if we continue with this momentum, it's possible we could see outperformance.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Deuschle: Hey, good morning. Michelle, can you lay out what drove the softer margins in IMS.\nMichelle Turner: Yeah, absolutely, Scott. Good morning. How are you?\nScott Deuschle: IMS and CS this quarter and then walk through the factors that unlocked the implied margin improvement in the second half. And if you can touch on the dynamics with backlog repricing, that would also be very helpful. Thank you.\nMichelle Turner: So we're getting a little bit of a garbled feedback, Scott, but I think what you're asking about is IMS margins and back half improvement for overall enterprise?\nScott Deuschle: Yeah, that's right. Backlog repricing. Thank you.\nMichelle Turner: Yeah, absolutely. So before I jump into the margins, I just want to kind of set the stage in terms of how we set the expectations for our team within Q1. We really had three objectives. One was to grow top line. The second was to meet our EPS and the third was to improve on our cash position from last year. And we met all three of those. And so to your point. Q1 margins did come in light. They were aligned with expectations, however. And so I think it's important to go back to what we talked about in our last earnings call, where we talked about having a more balanced plan this year. And in terms of revenue and EBIT, the expectations was revenue would be balanced with our first half margins being lower and accelerating in the second half, really driven by two things. One is around our higher margin product deliveries. So as we see the supply chain constraints continue to ease, we expect that our product deliveries are going to continue to improve, which is going to drive margins in the second half of the year. The second is related to our fixed price backlog and we talked about this a little bit in Q4, but aligned with our -- the macro headwinds that have been experienced across the industry and the higher inflationary environment. We experienced this particularly acutely within three of our sectors, which we talked about within the letter EW, IVS and ISR. We expect that this is going to continue to dissipate as we start to see some of the actions that we take -- we took at the end of last year start to pay dividends in the second half of this year. So we have a path to getting to the margins in the second half. And one other thing I would note in terms of Q1 is our Q1 margins were a bit deflated by lumpy aircraft revenue recognition within our ISR business. When you look at this, it's about a 40 to 50 basis point impact within the quarter. So we expect as this normalizes, that's also going to help our EBIT in the second half, the EBIT margins in the second half of the year. And then to your question specifically, Scott, on IMS, there's two pieces there. One is the mix. And for those that have been on this journey with us, you're familiar with our lumpy aircraft revenue recognition. So as I talked about from an enterprise perspective. In Q1, this had this dynamic played out for us. We did recognize the C3D order from the Air Force and as a result that aircraft revenue had an impact in terms of lower margins within the quarter. So we expect that that's going to continue to improve throughout the year as we work on the missionization of those aircraft. The second piece is related to the fixed price backlog that I talked about. This was an acute impact within our ISR business. And so you may remember we talked about attrition concerns that we had in Q4 along with the macro headwinds where we sit today within Q1, we are seeing improvement and we have seen our attrition stabilize and this is good news in terms of seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. And so we expect that the attrition and the performance is going to stabilize and we'll see less of those negative VAC impacts as we make our way through the year.\nChris Kubasik: Yeah, I think I'll just chime on Scott a little bit more. And look none of us are happy where we are in Q1 with the margins, but it's exactly what we had planned. And we clearly have a ramp to get to 15.5 by the end of the year, which we will. You know, we kind of teased out in the letter a little bit about our enterprise transformation. And I just wanted to talk briefly about that. You know, it's actually been less than four years ago that we had the merger. And what I call Phase One was our three year integration, which I highlighted is very, very successful with over 650 million of savings. But that was really just Phase One, right? That was harmonizing the benefits, closing down headquarters, consolidating segments, taking advantage, you know, of the enterprise relative to supply chain rebidding contracts. And, you know, it's water under the bridge, but still proud of what the team was able to accomplish, especially during COVID. So the natural evolution under our continuous improvement mindset is to move into Phase Two. And we've really looked at the success of our trusted disruptor strategy and how it's being embraced by our customers and suppliers, and we're applying it to ourselves. How do we disrupt ourselves and how do we get better and more efficient? So we just completed about a ten-week sprint to highlight and confirm that there are opportunities for us and we're trying to figure out how we're going to function differently and really rethink every function and everything we do. Easy example would be on real estate, especially as we've supported and embraced the remote and hybrid world. We don't need nearly as much office space as we used to, and there's a clear opportunity for savings. We're looking at functional cost. We're looking at what we do. We started using as everybody as I'm sure bots to remove some of the manual labor and actually provide some savings and also our indirect procurement strategy, just to name a few of the things. So now that the sprint is complete. We're in the design phase of the program. And on our next call, we plan to give you some actual tangible numbers and tangible timeframe to show how this is going to make L3Harris an even better company and contributed to our already industry leading margins. So the entire leadership team is excited about this project and I think we're off to a good start and more to come in, you know, 90 days.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Arment: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning Chris, Michelle and Mark.\nChris Kubasik: Good morning.\nPeter Arment: Chris, I wanted to ask on working capital and I'm sure Michelle want to weigh in. I know you've kind of focused on driving the metrics lower over the last few years. And last year you obviously built up some inventory. Maybe you could just update us I know working capital was less of a use this quarter, but maybe whether you think the 53 days that you kind of ended in 2021, is that still something you can target this year? And ultimately do you think you can get into the 40s? Thanks so much.\nMichelle Turner: Yeah, Peter. The short answer is we expect to get back to the 53, 54 levels by the end of this year. And so what you saw in Q1 were really proud of the teams. We saw working capital improved by about 300 million year-on-year. That's about an eight day improvement from where we were at this point at the end of Q1 '22, really driven by receivables. And I just want to highlight this is a great example of our Performance First initiative in action. So many thanks to our finance program management and contracts teams for implementing what we affectionately call Money Mondays, which is really focused on truncating our billing and invoicing processes to drive a more efficient use of our working capital. As a result, we were able to improve our DSO by two days from the same period last year. And so to your point about getting to the 5, 54 by the end of this year, we have to drive about 300 million of improvement between Q1 and the end of the year. And this is predominantly going to come from inventory. Almost equally split between our product inventory, which is going to be driven by the easing of supply chain constraints being able to ramp our deliveries in the second half of the year, but also around our performance based milestones on some of the new program wins that we have. The space business is a great example of that, where we're negotiating and getting cash up front as a result of some of these new orders. But then also executing on those programs are going to deliver cash for us in the second half as well.\nChris Kubasik: And Peter, clearly working capital is a top priority. It's something we briefed our board at each and every meeting. And as we have our monthly reviews, that's something that Michelle, I and the team look at. You know, I don't think it was surprising to see it. The working capital days grow in the last couple of years. You know, we were taking the approach, you know, to get all the parts we could pretty much at any cost, and that resulted in a build-up of inventory. We're much more confident in our ability now to plan and have alternatives to part. So you'll see that contribute as we bring down the working capital days. And if you recall, we were very aggressive and continue to be in negotiating performance based payments versus progress payments and tying the receipt of cash to specific performance milestones. And, you know, I view that as an opportunity. I think it's fair to say there's certain programs that are behind schedule either due to our performance or our suppliers performance. And you know, that's fine. We've identified it and we're working it. And that gives me even further confidence that we'll be able to hit our numbers as we continue to perform and tie the cash to those milestones. So thanks for the question, Peter.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Harned: Good morning. Thank you. As you work through the process on Aerojet Rocketdyne, how are you thinking about divestitures at this point? Things stand out that light commercial aircraft, simulation and training, public safety. So how are you thinking about kind of the timing of when you might do a divestiture, what the size might be, and how do you decide what fits?\nChris Kubasik: Yeah. Well, good morning, Doug. And yeah, we've talked about the need to divest to generate cash to help fund the Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition. So, yeah, we're not going to actually disclose what we've decided is non-core, but we have a regular process to review our portfolio and see as the company evolves, we're becoming more and more of a government or defense contractor. So we want things that align with the rest of the portfolio where we have synergies and the ability to share technologies and processes. We closed a real small one for 70 million, but for the larger ones, there's a process going on. We wanted to get through the first quarter right to update with current financial results and show that these are good if not great businesses. And it's the usual analysis, you know, we have good businesses and they're better owners for those businesses. We're not at all in a fire sale situation. We're going to take our time and we're going to get the maximum value for those properties. And, you know, I'd hope we could probably sign and announce something this year, maybe close one in Q4 or early 2024. But we'll run a process. We get a lot of inbound calls, especially after something like this, where I say what I just said, but there's interest in our portfolio. I'll just leave it at that and I'm confident we'll be able to get some proceeds. And I think I've previously said about $1 billion of proceeds from this process, meaning two or three divestitures. So I'll stay committed to that number.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global Research. Please proceed with your question.\nRichard Safran: Chris, Michelle, Mark, good morning. How are you? If it's okay, I'd like to return to the subject of bookings and the 1.3 book-to-bill you did in the quarter. I thought you might talk about full year bookings expectations. And then if we start to think longer term period of growth and the opportunity set, I was kind of wondering if you what you're thinking about if book-to-bill should be better than one in this growth period? Thanks.\nChris Kubasik: Yeah. Thanks, Rich. I mean, we always set our internal goals and aspirations to be more than 101 on book-to-bill. It's kind of hard to grow if you're not booking more orders than the revenue you're recognizing. I think the 1.3 was -- is absolutely a great way to start the year. When we talked last time, you know, this is the impact of a continuing resolution, right. And, until the CR gets broken loose, which it did, we start to see the money flow. And as I've said before, the only one who dislikes the CR more than industry is the Department of Defense. So I think we're off to a really good start. The President's budget request of $842 billion is 3% growth, as you know, Rich. And when you peel it back 4% on the investment accounts, you couple that with what we've been able to do internationally the last several years, the interest in the TCOM, the Space International, you would clearly expect that we'll be over 10 for book-to-bill for the year. And aspirationally I'd like to be at least 105 and maybe even 11. But it's somewhat lumpy, right, as you know. And it depends on we only talk and record the funded backlog. So that always has a little bit of a difference maybe relative to other companies. But we're feeling really, really good. And I think the key message here is, you know, this just confirms that, that our strategy is working and the customers appreciate and recognize what we're trying to do. Sometimes, we have more innovative solutions. The focus is on speed and schedule and cost. So we kind of mix those in and they've been pretty aggressive in pursuing different markets and different technologies. I will also say that Michelle and I and the team spent a lot of time focused on risk management and we had two opportunities in the quarter that were pretty exciting to us. But when the final RFP came out, there were fixed price development with fixed priced options and we chose not to bid those for obvious reasons. It's very hard to commit to a fixed price development program when you don't know the spec. I think we all look back at all the write-offs and losses and more times than not they're tied to that. So we will not be playing that game. I've elevated it to what I think is the highest levels within the Pentagon and the RFP has come out. We're not going to bid. And I would think over time others aren't going to bid. And ultimately we'll go back to the appropriate contracting vehicle for the appropriate opportunity. So kind of a roundabout answer there, Rich, but I wanted to cover a few of those -- a few of those points. I guess I'll just maybe throw in the pending acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne. I mean, by all accounts, and it's not always easy to look and compare apples-to-apples, but the munitions line in '24 appears to be at least 20% higher than '23. So I think we all know the need and the desire for these munitions for not only current threats, but future threats in addition to refilling the stockpile. So I think the acquisition in December made a heck of a lot of sense. And I think when you look at the budget, it makes even more sense. So I'll just leave it at that.\nMichelle Turner: And Rich just to add, international part of this, 30% of our 5.8 billion of record order within the quarter were international and the book-to-bill was over 1.5 for international. So really speaks to what Chris was alluding to in terms of the strategies working.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe kind of a number of things, Chris, but maybe just to go back to Aerojet, pretty well publicized about some of the capacity challenges and production challenges they're having. They just got this award from the DoD for $215 million to enhance their capabilities in production. I guess one of the overhangs or concerns out there was how much cash you guys were going to have to invest in that business. So clearly this potentially alleviates your CapEx. But I guess I'm trying to figure out, when can you guys start working together? Do you have to wait for this to close? Because I would imagine you guys would want to have some strategic input in terms of how they're building out or investing into the facilities to ramp up production. And I guess, just also staying on Aerojet, you mentioned divestitures. And I just wondered, does the -- do the big lower space engines fit in your portfolio? Or when you talk about these divestitures, can something fall out of Aerojet?\nChris Kubasik: Let me try to address them. Yes, relative to working together, there's some pretty clear rules that are called gun jumping, and we're very conscious, as is Aerojet Rocketdyne, not to trip over those thresholds. So we cannot actually work together and help them relative to the DPA money. We're aware of it. We have the ability to review the documents. But Eileen is running her company, I'm running my company. And until we close, we can't really change that. And that's been around forever with all acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, but all the more reason to get this transaction approved in a timely manner so that we can start working on that. The Defense Production Act, DPA, it's actually been around since the '50s. So this is a pile of money, a bucket of money that the DoD has, and it's really there to help strengthen the resiliency of the defense industrial base. And with the focus on manufacturing and capability of these key technologies, I was pleased to see that they received this money. I know the team has been working on this for probably a year there at Aerojet Rocketdyne. It's unrelated to the acquisition. But it is in support of their growth. It highlights to me the critical nature of these technologies and the DoD need for this company to be successful. And this money, I view, as maybe a little more tactical relative to increasing both the physical and the digital infrastructure of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Our acquisition being more less tactical and more strategic will assure a strong industrial base, a more viable competitor. And I think it's great news for Aerojet Rocketdyne and great news for the Department of Defense. And I'm pretty sure they have pretty thorough plans and a competent leadership team on how best to spend this money to optimize both capacity, digital engineering and moving a couple of production lines for the growth that we talked about. So relative to the divestitures, yes, we're not -- everything I was talking about would be legacy L3Harris. So clearly, the space propulsion space once the deal closes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Skibitski: Hey, good morning, everyone. Hey, guys, maybe Michele on capital allocation, as Chris alluded to in his remarks, you guys went pretty heavy on repurchases to start the year, pretty close to your $0.5 billion target for the full year. How are you thinking about allocation now on the balance of the year? Because I know you do have some debt maturing this summer, I think. So do you look to address that? Or are you looking at other options? Thanks.\nMichelle Turner: Good morning, Pete. So we don't anticipate any changes to our previous commentary in terms of capital allocation. Longer term, we expect to have a fairly balanced approach, and we've added some color to this within our investor letter in terms of buybacks, dividends and acquisitions. To your point about the Aerojet acquisition, we do anticipate that still closing this year. And as a result, our leverage ratio will get close to 4, with about $14 billion of debt. And so we are targeting over the next couple of years to bring that back down to below 3. So for this year, we're anticipating still the $500 million of share buybacks. So another $100 million to go based on the $400 million that we did within Q1, along with the dividends being consistent with what we previously communicated. In terms of the debt, we do expect to pay that down within June. And so you should see that play out consistent with what we shared before.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning. Hello?\nMichelle Turner: Hi, Rob. Can you hear us?\nRobert Stallard: I can hear you. Okay, sorry. Good morning, guys. So just to maybe wrap things up on the whole Aerojet topic. Let's assume things do get done, the deal is completed in the second half of this year, do you anticipate any further significant M&A in the medium-term time frame?\nChris Kubasik: Yes. I think that's an easy one, Rob. So just picking up where Michelle left off, the answer would be no. We'll have close to $13 billion, $14 billion of debt. And as we've said previously, we'll be using our free cash flow to reduce that debt to maintain our investment credit rating. So no. No is the answer. And a couple of years down the road, we can relook at that. But we want to keep a strong balance sheet, focus on execution. We really -- going back to December, there were three things that were a challenge, whether reality or perceived, and that was how could you integrate ViaSat, fix your operational issues and buy Aerojet Rocketdyne at the same time. I'm pleased to report on ViaSat that the integration is going well. It looks like both the revenue and the cost synergies will meet or exceed our business case, so that is exciting. We're about six months ahead of schedule relative to consolidating facilities. We have a four phase process. So the risk of moving is reasonably low. We're in the middle of the first phase. So we'll basically take the four major product lines one by one and that could be done by the end of this calendar year, which again is ahead of schedule. And the customer feedback and the interactions has been real exciting relative to these new capabilities. And we talked briefly about Link 16 in Space. And I'm pleased to say for the first time ever, Link 16 is in space, based on some recent payloads that were launched. So probably a little early to say that ViaSat is done, but it's on a really good track. And I would think we kind of have that behind us. I think on the operational challenges, again, really proud of this team in this quarter. It feels like we've turned the corner. A lot of this -- and I know it was -- nobody wanted to keep hearing about the products and 25% and revenue recognition and such, but it was unique compared to the rest of the industry. And now that we're getting the supplies in, we're redesigning products. You're seeing that in the top line and you'll see that in the bottom line as well. And then by the time the deal closes, the focus for my team and others will be on Aerojet Rocketdyne. So January 1, a lot of questions, a lot of uncertainty, and I think we're knocking these issues out one by one over a 12-month period. And by the time we get to '24, we're going to have a lot of momentum behind us. So I hope that helps. Maybe we have time for -- looks like one last question or -- that was it. All right. No other questions in the queue.\nChris Kubasik: So look I appreciate everybody participating and calling in and asking the questions. And we look forward to engaging with you in the months ahead. Have a great weekend. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Chris Kubasik",
            "content": "Okay. Good morning and thanks, Mark, and welcome aboard. We've been focusing on execution under our Performance First imperative and I'm pleased with our results. The first quarter was strong in many respects as we continue to build momentum with our trusted disruptor strategy, resulting in record orders and record backlog, improving macro trends serve as a positive backdrop, including the President's 2024 budget request released to Congress in March. We are well aligned with the priorities in the National Defense Strategy, which is reflected in robust funding and major areas for us, including space and joint force capabilities as well as missiles and munitions given our pending acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Our goal for Q1 was to grow the top line, meet the EPS number and have positive cash flow. The team rallied and delivered on all counts. For a third consecutive quarter, we had top line growth, a 9% increase with each segment growing. Operating income was up in two of the three segments, despite the usual headwinds. However, we came in line with where we thought we would be to begin the year. This resulted in EPS of $2.86 and we anticipate building from there. Free cash flow came in at over 300 million, a significant improvement from a year ago and we also front loaded our share repurchase commitment for the year. We received a second request from the FTC in March, which was followed by the Aerojet Rocketdyne shareholder approval vote the following day. Both of these outcomes were expected and we are responding to the FTC. We still anticipate the deal will close later this year. First quarter results are differentiated winning strategy and the overall business environment led us to reaffirm our 2023 guidance with the recognition that record orders and strong revenue growth to date could support a bias towards the higher end of our revenue guidance range should these trends continue. We still have work to do on profitability, but with abating macro headwinds, operational improvement initiatives and accelerating sequential growth in product centric businesses, we remain committed to our full year EPS guidance. So we're off to a strong start and I'd like to recognize our employees for continuing to prioritize Performance First in everything they do. With that, let's open the lines for questions, Rob. Yeah. Matt. Thanks for the question. We're gathering the data as you would anticipate. It's usually about a three to four month process. So we got the second request mid-March. So that would kind of suggest a June submission both for us and I know Aerojet Rocketdyne is doing the same thing. I have a feeling they'll probably submit a little earlier than us, given they've already done this, done this once. So, you know, the reason I'm confident in the 2023 close really comes down to the FTC's evaluation of this transaction. And, you know, when we look at it, we do not compete with Aerojet Rocketdyne. I mean, plain and simple, they make rocket motors and rocket engines and we do not. And that term is known as horizontal competitiveness. And there is none. We are not a customer of theirs. They are not a customer of ours, which is the term of art, the FTC and lawyers uses vertical competition. So I look at this and say, if there's no vertical competition and no horizontal competition, we'll submit the data, we'll certify the information, and we'll let the process run. You know, I think I'll just take a minute since I'm not sure I'll get any more Aerojet questions today. And I just think there's an incredible amount of confusion, mainly in DC, whether it's the DOD, the FTC or Members of Congress, and there are three terms that are used interchangeably that mean completely different things, and that is consolidation, merger and acquisition. And consolidation, in my opinion, is when two companies with similar capabilities combine and I think back 25 years to McDonnell Douglas and Boeing and they consolidated and nobody can dispute that after that transaction closed, there was one less commercial and military aircraft provider. And that's not what we're talking about today. A merger. I think a good example is obviously L3 and Harris. Two companies that are complementary, came together, which is now why we have capabilities and space, air, land, sea and cyber domains, significant revenue synergies, significant cost synergies over 650 million of cost savings that we shared with our shareholders and the DOD and resulted in a stronger company, in this case, providing more competition within the defense industrial base. And then Aerojet Rocketdyne is an acquisition. It's about 10% of our enterprise value. It's all cash. It's putting us into new markets that I mentioned already that we believe are growth markets as high? That I mentioned already that we believe are growth markets as highlighted in some of the recent budget decisions and fills in a gap in our portfolio. So I just felt I wanted to clarify that point and that is what gives me confidence that this deal will close in the second half of '23. Okay. Well, thank you, Sheila. I was actually in Clifton, New Jersey all day with our electronic warfare team. So just a short drive to get on TV. So thank you. Thank you for that. You know, let me kind of kick this off and then I'll ask Michelle to give a little more detail. And I really want to step back and think of space and the space domain and how it aligns with the strategy that we've been talking about since the merger. So a few fun facts that the date of the merger there were actually zero L3Harris or legacy company satellites in orbit. Today, there are seven that we have built, obviously, as a prime and we have 33 in backlog as a prime that will be launched over the next couple of years. So when we look back, we saw this as a growth market several years ago, which it is. We invested R&D and capital and facilities and tooling to position ourselves for growth. And the discussion aligned with what we've been saying for several years was to move up the food chain and become a prime by providing disruptive technologies and alternatives to our customers. And I think as we sit here today, we can see that that strategy, that investment is starting to payoff. We're probably best known recently for the work we're doing with the Missile Defense Agency and the Space Development Agency launches that will be coming up in the next year or so. But we're also a market leader in weather and ISR and also space exploration. And I appreciate you highlighting the fact that we're growing internationally as well. You don't always think of space as an international growth opportunity, but the team has a global reputation of delivering on time and having quality products, and we're seeing that being recognized around the globe. So, Michelle, do you want to maybe give more detail? Yeah. Thanks, Kristine. I believe the worst is behind us relative to all the macro headwinds we've talked about supply chain attrition and inflation. But to your question specifically on supply chain, you know, I'm proud of the team because these alternative parts just don't happen. We took a fair amount of talent and expense to redesign our products, if you will, design for availability. And the team has done an amazing job. And as we highlighted in our letter, we now have 1300 alternative parts that weren't originally designed into our products. So that's been able to allow us to grow. As you saw in the quarter and maybe position us for continued growth for the rest of the year. I think after the last few years, I hate to predict anything because it's hard to predict what's going to happen day to day or month to month. But I feel real good about the opportunities and the positioning. And we referenced, you know, we've signed a strategic agreement with a major microelectronic chip providing company. The benefit for us is it gives us assured availability and kind of moves us up and out of the allocation process, which is always an uncertainty kind of day by day. And in exchange for that, you know, we're sitting down and sharing with them our technology roadmap and working collaboratively as we design new products, taking advantage of some of their more advanced technologies. So long way of saying we're happy with the first quarter. We have good visibility for Q2 and beyond. And you know, if we continue with this momentum, it's possible we could see outperformance. Yeah, I think I'll just chime on Scott a little bit more. And look none of us are happy where we are in Q1 with the margins, but it's exactly what we had planned. And we clearly have a ramp to get to 15.5 by the end of the year, which we will. You know, we kind of teased out in the letter a little bit about our enterprise transformation. And I just wanted to talk briefly about that. You know, it's actually been less than four years ago that we had the merger. And what I call Phase One was our three year integration, which I highlighted is very, very successful with over 650 million of savings. But that was really just Phase One, right? That was harmonizing the benefits, closing down headquarters, consolidating segments, taking advantage, you know, of the enterprise relative to supply chain rebidding contracts. And, you know, it's water under the bridge, but still proud of what the team was able to accomplish, especially during COVID. So the natural evolution under our continuous improvement mindset is to move into Phase Two. And we've really looked at the success of our trusted disruptor strategy and how it's being embraced by our customers and suppliers, and we're applying it to ourselves. How do we disrupt ourselves and how do we get better and more efficient? So we just completed about a ten-week sprint to highlight and confirm that there are opportunities for us and we're trying to figure out how we're going to function differently and really rethink every function and everything we do. Easy example would be on real estate, especially as we've supported and embraced the remote and hybrid world. We don't need nearly as much office space as we used to, and there's a clear opportunity for savings. We're looking at functional cost. We're looking at what we do. We started using as everybody as I'm sure bots to remove some of the manual labor and actually provide some savings and also our indirect procurement strategy, just to name a few of the things. So now that the sprint is complete. We're in the design phase of the program. And on our next call, we plan to give you some actual tangible numbers and tangible timeframe to show how this is going to make L3Harris an even better company and contributed to our already industry leading margins. So the entire leadership team is excited about this project and I think we're off to a good start and more to come in, you know, 90 days. Good morning. And Peter, clearly working capital is a top priority. It's something we briefed our board at each and every meeting. And as we have our monthly reviews, that's something that Michelle, I and the team look at. You know, I don't think it was surprising to see it. The working capital days grow in the last couple of years. You know, we were taking the approach, you know, to get all the parts we could pretty much at any cost, and that resulted in a build-up of inventory. We're much more confident in our ability now to plan and have alternatives to part. So you'll see that contribute as we bring down the working capital days. And if you recall, we were very aggressive and continue to be in negotiating performance based payments versus progress payments and tying the receipt of cash to specific performance milestones. And, you know, I view that as an opportunity. I think it's fair to say there's certain programs that are behind schedule either due to our performance or our suppliers performance. And you know, that's fine. We've identified it and we're working it. And that gives me even further confidence that we'll be able to hit our numbers as we continue to perform and tie the cash to those milestones. So thanks for the question, Peter. Yeah. Well, good morning, Doug. And yeah, we've talked about the need to divest to generate cash to help fund the Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition. So, yeah, we're not going to actually disclose what we've decided is non-core, but we have a regular process to review our portfolio and see as the company evolves, we're becoming more and more of a government or defense contractor. So we want things that align with the rest of the portfolio where we have synergies and the ability to share technologies and processes. We closed a real small one for 70 million, but for the larger ones, there's a process going on. We wanted to get through the first quarter right to update with current financial results and show that these are good if not great businesses. And it's the usual analysis, you know, we have good businesses and they're better owners for those businesses. We're not at all in a fire sale situation. We're going to take our time and we're going to get the maximum value for those properties. And, you know, I'd hope we could probably sign and announce something this year, maybe close one in Q4 or early 2024. But we'll run a process. We get a lot of inbound calls, especially after something like this, where I say what I just said, but there's interest in our portfolio. I'll just leave it at that and I'm confident we'll be able to get some proceeds. And I think I've previously said about $1 billion of proceeds from this process, meaning two or three divestitures. So I'll stay committed to that number. Yeah. Thanks, Rich. I mean, we always set our internal goals and aspirations to be more than 101 on book-to-bill. It's kind of hard to grow if you're not booking more orders than the revenue you're recognizing. I think the 1.3 was -- is absolutely a great way to start the year. When we talked last time, you know, this is the impact of a continuing resolution, right. And, until the CR gets broken loose, which it did, we start to see the money flow. And as I've said before, the only one who dislikes the CR more than industry is the Department of Defense. So I think we're off to a really good start. The President's budget request of $842 billion is 3% growth, as you know, Rich. And when you peel it back 4% on the investment accounts, you couple that with what we've been able to do internationally the last several years, the interest in the TCOM, the Space International, you would clearly expect that we'll be over 10 for book-to-bill for the year. And aspirationally I'd like to be at least 105 and maybe even 11. But it's somewhat lumpy, right, as you know. And it depends on we only talk and record the funded backlog. So that always has a little bit of a difference maybe relative to other companies. But we're feeling really, really good. And I think the key message here is, you know, this just confirms that, that our strategy is working and the customers appreciate and recognize what we're trying to do. Sometimes, we have more innovative solutions. The focus is on speed and schedule and cost. So we kind of mix those in and they've been pretty aggressive in pursuing different markets and different technologies. I will also say that Michelle and I and the team spent a lot of time focused on risk management and we had two opportunities in the quarter that were pretty exciting to us. But when the final RFP came out, there were fixed price development with fixed priced options and we chose not to bid those for obvious reasons. It's very hard to commit to a fixed price development program when you don't know the spec. I think we all look back at all the write-offs and losses and more times than not they're tied to that. So we will not be playing that game. I've elevated it to what I think is the highest levels within the Pentagon and the RFP has come out. We're not going to bid. And I would think over time others aren't going to bid. And ultimately we'll go back to the appropriate contracting vehicle for the appropriate opportunity. So kind of a roundabout answer there, Rich, but I wanted to cover a few of those -- a few of those points. I guess I'll just maybe throw in the pending acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne. I mean, by all accounts, and it's not always easy to look and compare apples-to-apples, but the munitions line in '24 appears to be at least 20% higher than '23. So I think we all know the need and the desire for these munitions for not only current threats, but future threats in addition to refilling the stockpile. So I think the acquisition in December made a heck of a lot of sense. And I think when you look at the budget, it makes even more sense. So I'll just leave it at that. Let me try to address them. Yes, relative to working together, there's some pretty clear rules that are called gun jumping, and we're very conscious, as is Aerojet Rocketdyne, not to trip over those thresholds. So we cannot actually work together and help them relative to the DPA money. We're aware of it. We have the ability to review the documents. But Eileen is running her company, I'm running my company. And until we close, we can't really change that. And that's been around forever with all acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, but all the more reason to get this transaction approved in a timely manner so that we can start working on that. The Defense Production Act, DPA, it's actually been around since the '50s. So this is a pile of money, a bucket of money that the DoD has, and it's really there to help strengthen the resiliency of the defense industrial base. And with the focus on manufacturing and capability of these key technologies, I was pleased to see that they received this money. I know the team has been working on this for probably a year there at Aerojet Rocketdyne. It's unrelated to the acquisition. But it is in support of their growth. It highlights to me the critical nature of these technologies and the DoD need for this company to be successful. And this money, I view, as maybe a little more tactical relative to increasing both the physical and the digital infrastructure of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Our acquisition being more less tactical and more strategic will assure a strong industrial base, a more viable competitor. And I think it's great news for Aerojet Rocketdyne and great news for the Department of Defense. And I'm pretty sure they have pretty thorough plans and a competent leadership team on how best to spend this money to optimize both capacity, digital engineering and moving a couple of production lines for the growth that we talked about. So relative to the divestitures, yes, we're not -- everything I was talking about would be legacy L3Harris. So clearly, the space propulsion space once the deal closes. Yes. I think that's an easy one, Rob. So just picking up where Michelle left off, the answer would be no. We'll have close to $13 billion, $14 billion of debt. And as we've said previously, we'll be using our free cash flow to reduce that debt to maintain our investment credit rating. So no. No is the answer. And a couple of years down the road, we can relook at that. But we want to keep a strong balance sheet, focus on execution. We really -- going back to December, there were three things that were a challenge, whether reality or perceived, and that was how could you integrate ViaSat, fix your operational issues and buy Aerojet Rocketdyne at the same time. I'm pleased to report on ViaSat that the integration is going well. It looks like both the revenue and the cost synergies will meet or exceed our business case, so that is exciting. We're about six months ahead of schedule relative to consolidating facilities. We have a four phase process. So the risk of moving is reasonably low. We're in the middle of the first phase. So we'll basically take the four major product lines one by one and that could be done by the end of this calendar year, which again is ahead of schedule. And the customer feedback and the interactions has been real exciting relative to these new capabilities. And we talked briefly about Link 16 in Space. And I'm pleased to say for the first time ever, Link 16 is in space, based on some recent payloads that were launched. So probably a little early to say that ViaSat is done, but it's on a really good track. And I would think we kind of have that behind us. I think on the operational challenges, again, really proud of this team in this quarter. It feels like we've turned the corner. A lot of this -- and I know it was -- nobody wanted to keep hearing about the products and 25% and revenue recognition and such, but it was unique compared to the rest of the industry. And now that we're getting the supplies in, we're redesigning products. You're seeing that in the top line and you'll see that in the bottom line as well. And then by the time the deal closes, the focus for my team and others will be on Aerojet Rocketdyne. So January 1, a lot of questions, a lot of uncertainty, and I think we're knocking these issues out one by one over a 12-month period. And by the time we get to '24, we're going to have a lot of momentum behind us. So I hope that helps. Maybe we have time for -- looks like one last question or -- that was it. All right. No other questions in the queue. So look I appreciate everybody participating and calling in and asking the questions. And we look forward to engaging with you in the months ahead. Have a great weekend. Thanks."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Michelle Turner",
            "content": "Yeah. So I'll add some color in terms of our strategy and action and some of the numbers, Sheila. So thanks for highlighting this. So over the last six months we have submitted over 7 billion in space proposals, booking a billion and a half within Q1. So we're super excited about this book-to-bill over 2.0 within this sector. Kelly and her team are doing an amazing job in terms of recognizing the current environment within the US. But also to your point, Sheila, around expanding the aperture in terms of international exposure as well. Half of the -- billion and a half in bookings are international in nature. And so when we think about margins within this space, this is where Kelly and the team are thinking differently in terms of leveraging our domestic footprint to be able to drive shareholder value in a different way across the globe. So we're excited about this double-digit growth from a revenue perspective. We expect this to continue to be a tailwind for us within '23 and beyond. Yeah, absolutely, Scott. Good morning. How are you? So we're getting a little bit of a garbled feedback, Scott, but I think what you're asking about is IMS margins and back half improvement for overall enterprise? Yeah, absolutely. So before I jump into the margins, I just want to kind of set the stage in terms of how we set the expectations for our team within Q1. We really had three objectives. One was to grow top line. The second was to meet our EPS and the third was to improve on our cash position from last year. And we met all three of those. And so to your point. Q1 margins did come in light. They were aligned with expectations, however. And so I think it's important to go back to what we talked about in our last earnings call, where we talked about having a more balanced plan this year. And in terms of revenue and EBIT, the expectations was revenue would be balanced with our first half margins being lower and accelerating in the second half, really driven by two things. One is around our higher margin product deliveries. So as we see the supply chain constraints continue to ease, we expect that our product deliveries are going to continue to improve, which is going to drive margins in the second half of the year. The second is related to our fixed price backlog and we talked about this a little bit in Q4, but aligned with our -- the macro headwinds that have been experienced across the industry and the higher inflationary environment. We experienced this particularly acutely within three of our sectors, which we talked about within the letter EW, IVS and ISR. We expect that this is going to continue to dissipate as we start to see some of the actions that we take -- we took at the end of last year start to pay dividends in the second half of this year. So we have a path to getting to the margins in the second half. And one other thing I would note in terms of Q1 is our Q1 margins were a bit deflated by lumpy aircraft revenue recognition within our ISR business. When you look at this, it's about a 40 to 50 basis point impact within the quarter. So we expect as this normalizes, that's also going to help our EBIT in the second half, the EBIT margins in the second half of the year. And then to your question specifically, Scott, on IMS, there's two pieces there. One is the mix. And for those that have been on this journey with us, you're familiar with our lumpy aircraft revenue recognition. So as I talked about from an enterprise perspective. In Q1, this had this dynamic played out for us. We did recognize the C3D order from the Air Force and as a result that aircraft revenue had an impact in terms of lower margins within the quarter. So we expect that that's going to continue to improve throughout the year as we work on the missionization of those aircraft. The second piece is related to the fixed price backlog that I talked about. This was an acute impact within our ISR business. And so you may remember we talked about attrition concerns that we had in Q4 along with the macro headwinds where we sit today within Q1, we are seeing improvement and we have seen our attrition stabilize and this is good news in terms of seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. And so we expect that the attrition and the performance is going to stabilize and we'll see less of those negative VAC impacts as we make our way through the year. Yeah, Peter. The short answer is we expect to get back to the 53, 54 levels by the end of this year. And so what you saw in Q1 were really proud of the teams. We saw working capital improved by about 300 million year-on-year. That's about an eight day improvement from where we were at this point at the end of Q1 '22, really driven by receivables. And I just want to highlight this is a great example of our Performance First initiative in action. So many thanks to our finance program management and contracts teams for implementing what we affectionately call Money Mondays, which is really focused on truncating our billing and invoicing processes to drive a more efficient use of our working capital. As a result, we were able to improve our DSO by two days from the same period last year. And so to your point about getting to the 5, 54 by the end of this year, we have to drive about 300 million of improvement between Q1 and the end of the year. And this is predominantly going to come from inventory. Almost equally split between our product inventory, which is going to be driven by the easing of supply chain constraints being able to ramp our deliveries in the second half of the year, but also around our performance based milestones on some of the new program wins that we have. The space business is a great example of that, where we're negotiating and getting cash up front as a result of some of these new orders. But then also executing on those programs are going to deliver cash for us in the second half as well. And Rich just to add, international part of this, 30% of our 5.8 billion of record order within the quarter were international and the book-to-bill was over 1.5 for international. So really speaks to what Chris was alluding to in terms of the strategies working. Good morning, Pete. So we don't anticipate any changes to our previous commentary in terms of capital allocation. Longer term, we expect to have a fairly balanced approach, and we've added some color to this within our investor letter in terms of buybacks, dividends and acquisitions. To your point about the Aerojet acquisition, we do anticipate that still closing this year. And as a result, our leverage ratio will get close to 4, with about $14 billion of debt. And so we are targeting over the next couple of years to bring that back down to below 3. So for this year, we're anticipating still the $500 million of share buybacks. So another $100 million to go based on the $400 million that we did within Q1, along with the dividends being consistent with what we previously communicated. In terms of the debt, we do expect to pay that down within June. And so you should see that play out consistent with what we shared before. Hi, Rob. Can you hear us?"

Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Also, today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Now at this time, I'll turn things over to Mr. Dan Gittsovich, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nDaniel Gittsovich: Thank you, Bob. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Chris and Ken. Yesterday, we published our third quarter earnings release detailing our financial results and guidance. We have also provided a supplemental earnings presentation on our website. Today's discussion will include certain matters that constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please reference our earnings release and SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to GAAP measures in the earnings release. With that, I'll turn it over to Chris for some opening remarks.\nChristopher Kubasik: Good morning, everyone, and thanks Dan. We had a very strong quarter, and our strategy is delivering results. We achieved record order volume, an impressive book-to-bill, robust segment operating margins and solid free cash flow. We're proud of the progress we've made so far this year, and are confident that we are on track to deliver on the commitments we made to our stakeholders. Our customers tell us that we're agile, fast and fully aligned with their priorities. This empowers us to deliver the right capabilities at the right time, meeting the evolving needs of our nation and its allies. Our business model enables us to operate, as either a prime, a sub or merchant supplier, offering commercial pricing or utilizing the traditional government acquisition approach. This flexibility in our platform agnostic approach, gives us a unique advantage in rapidly adapting to the changing threat environment, and addressing our customers mission critical needs. It also enables us to effectively partner with new entrants, and non-traditional contractors. We've made key acquisitions including Aerojet Rocketdyne and Tactical Data Links, while simultaneously divesting non-core assets. These moves have allowed us to further hone our portfolio, to reinforce our national security focus. Our capabilities in areas like resilient communications, munitions, space, ISR and passive sensing are innovative, allowing us to deliver solutions across all domains, and providing our customers with superiority across the entirety, of the electromagnetic spectrum. Our diversified portfolio limits our reliance on a single program, enabling steady growth with lower variability and a greater ability to manage risk over the long-term. Partnerships are a hallmark of our trusted disruptor strategy. On Wednesday, we announced a strategic partnership with Palantir, working together to deliver advanced solutions to our customers. In fact, yesterday the White House ordered the Pentagon and the Intel agencies to increase the use of AI. So, I feel we're well positioned in this evolving market. We continue to focus on profitable growth. This approach allows us to grow, while delivering sustained margin improvement, which will drive financial outperformance. Growth for growth's sake is not our strategy. We prioritize profitable growth that drives appropriate returns, and cash generation. Our strategy to act as a sub or merchant supplier, also enables us to participate in key strategic programs even when we choose not to Prime. I'm pleased to report that we've made considerable progress on our innovative LHX NeXt program, to transform L3Harris and how we operate. Ken, would you like to elaborate?\nKenneth Bedingfield: Thanks Chris. We're on track to exceed our 2024 run rate cost savings target of $400 million, and now expect to achieve at least $600 million by the end of the year. We are also confident in our ability to reach our $1 billion cost savings target a year early, and our pipeline provides opportunity for additional cost savings, to exceed the $1 billion target. The accelerated savings give us confidence that, we will surpass the segment operating margin target of 16% that we set at our Investor Day, and we now expect to achieve at least 16% in 2026. This performance highlights, our ongoing commitment to transforming the way we work, improving operational efficiency and program management, as well as aggressively managing all costs delivering value to our shareholders. We are realizing the power of real-time data across all of our systems, ERP, manufacturing engineering, to name a few and even our products, for better decision making. Moving into the next phase of LHX NeXt, our primary focus has shifted from workforce optimization to strengthening supply-chain management, and modernizing our digital infrastructure. By leveraging the scale of our enterprise using modern AI-enabled tools from partners like Palantir, we are improving cost, quality and delivery times for our customers. At the same time, this creates demand stability for our suppliers, giving them the opportunity to grow alongside us. Supply-chain management is becoming a competitive differentiator. Back to you Chris.\nChristopher Kubasik: We had several key wins during the quarter. In our Communications segment, we won a $600 million Next Generation Jammer contract. Following the cost plus development phase, it will enable L3Harris to establish a long-term jamming franchise, worth billions of dollars in high margin production of airborne pods. These types of wins are critical to driving sustained long-term profitable growth, and reinforce the strength and diversity of our technology portfolio. Another highlight this quarter, was securing one of two positions on a $1.2 billion IDIQ contract, with the U.S. Navy to provide support for the P-8A Poseidon fleet. This contract strengthens our relationship with the Navy within the ISR sector. On the international front, we were awarded three contracts for software defined tactical radios, by NATO allies totaling over $400 million. We began deliveries in the quarter again displaying the speed at, which we can provide capabilities to our customers. The international demand for these resilient software defined radios, with our proprietary waveforms highlights our leading capability in low probability of detect, and low probability of INTERCEPT communications. This is driving our allies to choose L3Harris solutions, over indigenous products with increased frequency. Over the last several years, we have strategically invested in a new mission set bringing important capabilities in space-based missile warning, and missile tracking leading to orders for 50 satellites, five of which are in orbit. Our advanced solid rocket motor technology, also plays a critical role in this mission set, demonstrating our leadership in advanced missile and missile defense technology including hypersonics, counter hypersonics and precise attitude control. This is illustrated by our recent win on the Glide Phase Interceptor contract, as part of an industry team where we will provide two critical propulsion systems, including a large solid rocket motor for the first stage, and an advanced motor to power the third stage of the interceptor missile. This interceptor will defense against hypersonic glide vehicles, a real threat in today's environment. The Glide Phase Interceptor Award establishes another long-term propulsion franchise, alongside our next generation interceptor win earlier this year, where we were part of a different industry team. With that, I'd like to turn it back to Ken.\nKenneth Bedingfield: As we look ahead to next year, we anticipate growth across key financial metrics including revenue, segment operating margin, EPS and free cash flow. We're on track to achieve our 2026 framework of $23 billion in revenue, at least 16% segment operating margin and $2.8 billion in free cash flow. We do expect the growth rate in '26 to exceed 2025, given budgetary and political dynamics over the next few months. We'll provide more detailed 2025 guidance in January, but these commitments are a testament to our ongoing focus on disciplined growth and profitability. Our financial framework anticipates mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, continued margin expansion and low-double-digit free cash flow growth, as we achieve our targets. As we reach our near term target debt leverage ratio of 3.0, and deploy excess capital to repurchase shares, our free cash flow per share growth, will accelerate into the mid-double-digits over a 2023 baseline. Let's dive into consolidated results for the third quarter, our fifth straight quarter of strong delivery of financial results versus expectations. We're continuing to see strong demand across the board, with new awards totaling over $7 billion this quarter. This allowed us to achieve an overall company book-to-bill of 1.4 with all four segments delivering book-to-bill of at least one. Our Aerojet Rocketdyne and Communication Systems segments had particularly strong bookings this past quarter, with both recording book-to-bill well above 1.5. Our total backlog has now reached a new record of $34 billion. Turning to the financials, consolidated revenue increased by 8% in the third quarter. Operating margins improved to 15.7%, an impressive 70 basis point increase driven by continuing program execution, and operational performance with strong contributions from LHX NeXt. Non-GAAP EPS grew by 5%, and on a pension adjusted basis our EPS increased by 8%. Our performance so far in '24 puts us on track to achieve the top end, of our full year guidance range of 9% to 11% pension adjusted EPS growth. We believe this is the best economic measure of our earnings per share, highlighting how our disciplined focus is delivering strong bottom line results. We recognize the need to take on risk to grow, and as you can see from this quarter's results, we are managing our portfolio to enable profitable growth and limit risk to digestible single-digit and low-double-digit millions. We generated over $700 million of free cash flow this quarter, with adjusted free cash flow of $728 million primarily driven by increased operating income, and effective working capital management. And we reduced overall debt by $325 million during the quarter, reducing our net leverage to 3.1 nearing our target. Turning to segment performance, we saw strong growth in CS with revenue up 10%, supported by increased domestic and international demand for resilient communications equipment, and related waveforms as well as higher volumes for night vision devices. At IMS, revenue is up 7% year-over-year. This was driven by increased volume of avionics products, higher aircraft integration volume for international and domestic customers, and increased volume for advanced electronics for space and munitions programs. SAS revenue was about flat, due to the divestiture of the antenna business in Q2, lower F-35 related volumes as TR-3 development ramps down and a few challenges on classified development programs in our space business. This was offset by classified program growth in Intel and cyber, and increased volume supporting FAA mission-critical safety of flight networks. On an organic basis, revenue growth for SAS was 2%. Aerojet Rocketdyne contributed approximately $600 million to our overall revenue this quarter. We are pleased with the segment's performance and have booked significant new business to support future profitable growth as Chris mentioned. All right, turning our attention to margins, CS delivered excellent margins of 26%, a 350 basis point improvement year-over-year, driven by strong performance from higher volumes, favorable high margin, international mix, proprietary waveform license sales and LHX NeXt cost savings. Waveform sales, a focused effort in the last few years are demonstrating our effective transition from hardware centric to software enabled products. IMS also performed well reporting margins of 12.2%, up 30 basis points from the previous year, primarily due to improved program execution driving net positive EAC adjustments in the quarter, as well as LHX NeXt contributions and favorable mix in our commercial aviation solutions business. SAS margins declined to 11.6, largely due to a one-time license sale in the prior year, and the previously mentioned challenges on classified development programs in our space business, partially offset by LHX NeXt savings. Aerojet Rocketdyne delivered margins of 12.6%, which included $11 million of benefit from amortization of off market purchase price adjustments. I'll remind you that these adjustments, were always considered in our guidance. As PPA amortizes off, we continue to expect economic profit of new programs to fill in the gap. Turning to guidance. Given our strong performance so far this year, we are increasing guidance again. We now expect total company revenue of $21.1 million to $21.3 billion, segment operating margin of approximately 15.5%, EPS in the range of $12.95 to $13.15 per share, and we're reiterating free cash flow guidance of $2.2 billion. You can find additional segment guidance details in the earnings release, and presentation on our website. Overall, we're extremely pleased with our strong performance so far this year. Reflecting on the progress the team has made, since I joined L3Harris nearly a year ago. I'm truly impressed, by how we've built on our strengths. Our agility and ability to make fast informed decisions, are clear differentiators and it's this culture of innovation, responsiveness, decisive leadership and being a platform agnostic, honest broker that enables this company to deliver on our customers most mission critical needs, while staying fully aligned with the commitments we've made, to our stakeholders. Looking ahead, I'm more and more confident about L3Harris trajectory. We've established ourselves as the trusted disruptor in the industry, continually pushing to disrupt through innovation, while maintaining a trusted and disciplined focus on operational excellence, and financial performance. The future of L3Harris is bright, and this team will continue to unlock new opportunities to drive sustained value. With that back to you, Chris.\nChristopher Kubasik: I want to reinforce that our mission is clear. We are here to deliver for our customer's mission critical needs, in an increasingly complex global threat environment. We are proud to be at the forefront, helping to build our nation's next arsenal of democracy. Unlike World War II, it's more than just building platforms. It's the convergence of hardware, software and AI. And we're uniquely positioned for the future. Our team's work is vital to helping the warfighter, ensure the safety and security of our nation and its allies. And we remain fully committed, to delivering the technologies and solutions that will protect and defend democracy. Bob, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Certainly, Mr. Kubasik. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first this morning to Sheila Kahyaoglu at Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Chris and Ken. Thank you so much. Maybe, Chris, if we could start big picture. You reiterated the long-term target of $23 billion of revenue, which implies an acceleration of organic growth from '24 levels and '25 to '26. So can you maybe talk about the biggest drivers of the acceleration? What's left to capture? What are opportunities that you're looking at given the strong book-to-bill this quarter?\nChristopher Kubasik: All right, good morning Sheila and thanks for the question. Yes, if you recall in 2023, we had a book-to-bill of 1.21. We're sitting at 1.14 after nine months. And as Ken said, we have a record backlog I believe when I look at our portfolio that we are aligned with the important areas of the U.S. budget, and that will allow us to grow and meet our $23 billion commitment. When I look at CS, we talked about the NATO software-defined radios. There are other opportunities in Europe that we're looking at right now. And just like we talked about last time, we still have a $10 billion international pipeline in CS alone. On the space side, I think there's some well-documented budget pressures here in the near term. But I think given the threat environment. And as the customer continues to move missions from air to space, by 2026, we should be able to see more growth in the out years. In Aerojet Rocketdyne, the operations are improving. We're testing in the supply-chain. We're investing in capacity. That expansion should hit us in 2026, which will enable us to accelerate growth. I mentioned the Glide Phase Interceptor and the next-gen interceptor as well. So, those are large solid rocket motor opportunities that are very, very significant. And then, of course, in IMS, we always have international ISR opportunities, which are a little lumpy. But given our good performance so far in that market, I think that can provide us upside as well.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Myles Walton with Wolfe Research.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping you could touch on the cost reduction effort coming in a year ahead of time. I think in the Investor Day, you talked about when that $1 billion cost reduction efforts was accomplished. You'd have $400 million benefit through the margins. Are you at or near that in '25? And if so, why aren't you knocking on the door of 16% margins in '25?\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. Let me start with that, Myles, good morning. Then I'll let can give a little more detail. But this is the top priority for me, and the entire leadership team. I've talked in the past as to how we did the easy part of integration shortly after the merger, and we were disrupted with the pandemic. And this is really a Phase 2 of the integration, which we've now talking about the transformation of L3Harris. We are looking at every single function, every line of business. We're down to policies, systems, and really just focused on eliminating non-value, or waste in the systems. So we've been very aggressive. We have a dedicated leader and team focused on this 24/7, and you're starting to see the results. I think there was a lot of skepticism. I'm proud of the team. I'm proud of the fact we're ahead of schedule, and it's quite exciting, and we're going to continue to push to achieve that $1 billion next year. And more thereafter, but I'll let Ken talk about the margin impact.\nKenneth Bedingfield: Yes. Thanks, Chris, and thanks for the question, Myles. Good morning. In terms of the margin flow-through, I would say we are absolutely tracking to the target that we set. And I think the team is working aggressively, to try to realize additional margin opportunity out of the savings either through, or through a combination of over delivery of the ultimate target. As well as making sure that we can realize as much of the opportunity, in turning the savings into margins as possible. We'll give more detail on 2025 guidance in January. We mentioned in the remarks that 2026 margin target has moved, from approximately 16% to at least 16%. And as we think about that, it won't necessarily be a linear path, but we certainly see opportunity for margin improvement in '25 as well. Remember, these are run rate savings, so we expect them to recur and certainly have long-term benefit. We're certainly focused on the long-term, but we will see benefit in '25 flow-through. And just as we look at it, again, the program is really performing well. The team is firing on all cylinders, and really feel like it's delivering the results that we need.\nMyles Walton: All right, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Richard Safran at Seaport Research Partners.\nRichard Safran: Chris, Ken, Dan, good morning. I'd like to ask you about Palantir, if I might, the partnership that you talked about. So two things here. First, what's - if you could tell us what's the investment, and profit sharing arrangement between the two of you. And second, could you go into a little bit about the strategic rationale for doing this? I mean you mentioned complementary capabilities. It seems to me maybe you're looking to avoid a huge technology R&D spend here. But that was my view. I thought we'd get your take on it?\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. No, Richard, thanks. There is no upfront investment, or capital for this. This relationship goes back about five years. And before we signed a strategic relationship with another company, we wanted to make sure that the cultures are aligned, our focus on mission was aligned, and there's just a lot of great team work, not only at the top of the two organizations, but throughout the organization. So based on that, we wanted to take it to the next level. This will be both teams looking for opportunities to bid. We have one program where Palantir is the prime Titan. It's a mobile vehicular mobile network, where we're a sub providing the resilient comms, the comms architecture, the comm hardware. There are other programs where we're going to prime, and then there's R&D projects we're working on together. So I would say it's businesses as usual, and it's really putting the two capabilities together. As far as the strategic rationale, I mean, could not have timed to the White House announcement any better that I referenced, if you hadn't had a chance to look at it. I mean they are really putting the pressure on the DoD and the Intel agencies, to use AI more. And I think what our secret sauce is, there's no one company that can do it all. They may think they can, but there really isn't. And our strategy of partnering and working with the best companies in a platform-agnostic manner, I think, is a key differentiator. And to have the AI skills and the algorithms, and the large language models that they have is literally billions of dollars. I don't have billions of dollars in five or 10 years to build it. So, we ought to team and work collaboratively, and could not be more excited about that. Maybe I'll let Ken - and I talked about the customer side, and we also received a few calls from customers as early as yesterday, shortly after the announcement. There's a lot of excitement about this, and couldn't be more proud of the team. But we're also using their products internally as part of LHX NeXt. I don't know, Ken, do you want to give just a couple of examples of how that's helping us.\nKenneth Bedingfield: Sure. Thanks. Yes, we're using a Palantir product. We call it the unified data layer, as I mentioned in my remarks, and enables us to look across all of our systems, whether those are ERP systems, manufacturing systems, engineering, labor, other, even to the point Chris talked about in terms of some of the customer opportunities, looking across the data generated out of our products in order to do some of the advanced targeting, real-time targeting and things like that, that are subject to the strategic partnership. But again, back to some of the internals, we're using that data to make real-time, data-driven decisions to drive cost down. We've seen that as a contributor in identifying not only areas for labor efficiencies, factory efficiencies, process improvements, but it is contributing significantly to the supply-chain effort as well. So really excited about the partnership. I think it's one of these where there's certainly benefit on the customer side, and we are realizing that benefit upfront in our internal operations to really show how it will actually operationalize itself for our customers.\nChristopher Kubasik: And I'll just chime in. We recently rolled out a - for our program managers and their financial analysts, the ability to get data even more timely, real-time. And at the end of the day, Rich, it's all about managing your programs. And the earlier you can get the data, the earlier you can identify opportunities and risks, the easier it is to either realize those opportunities, or mitigate the risks. And it's always been a struggle in this industry to get timely data and it's exciting. Our 800 financial analysts have real-time data, and I think it's going to make a difference in our operations in a positive way.\nRichard Safran: Appreciate all the color. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: We'll go next now to Doug Harned at Bernstein.\nDouglas Harned: Good morning. Thank you.\nChristopher Kubasik: Good morning.\nDouglas Harned: In CS, you had good results with native demand for radios. When you look at the outlook here, and I would say first on the Army and Marines side in the U.S. and then on NATO, I guess since its World Series Day, what inning are we in, in outfitting the Army and Marines in the U.S. with next-gen radios? And then, how do you see that playing out with NATO countries as well?\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. Let me - we'll start with the U.S., where we can't agree whether we're in the bottom of the third or the top of the fourth, but somewhere between those two is where I think we're positioned here with the DoD. There's still a lot of strong demand. I'm proud of the team. We're now upselling our latest waveforms. In addition, to just the software-defined radios, sometimes thought of as hardware, although it's all about the waveforms. That gives us a great, great market opportunity. And every time there's an annual buy. We continue to win. So I'm pretty excited there. I'd say on NATO, it's probably even earlier, or maybe the second inning. And what we're really seeing, is the interoperability absolutely critical within the NATO countries, our resilience, our crypto mods. These are all reasons why NATO countries are selecting us, over their indigenous radio providers, it's a huge, huge opportunity. In fact, we recently won a program with the Netherlands for $1.4 billion over 10 years. That's going through the congressional U.S. Congressional notification process. I think one of the key lessons learned coming out of Ukraine, is the need for this interoperability and the need for resilient comms. And majority of the NATO countries are, in fact, not only signing up, but spending the 2% of GDP that they committed to. We have a couple of opportunities that we won here in Q4, already in Eastern Europe. The pipeline is healthy, and we're real, real excited about the software-defined tactical radio business. And as I said, $10 billion international pipeline. Ken?\nKenneth Bedingfield: Yes, Doug, just to put a couple of numbers on the U.S. side, to your question about Army and Marine Corps, in particular, the DoD has a modernization cycle. We think that's just shy of 500,000 radios in the current cycle. And almost 150,000 of those have been awarded. We have seen about three-quarters of those about 75% coming to L3Harris, that leaves somewhere shy of 300,000 radios to go. So just put a little bit of numbers behind Chris' comments on the U.S. market, I feel really good about that modernization cycle, and how we're doing against the competitive landscape there. You may remember, there's a competitor or two in the handhelds as well as a different set of Manpack and Vehicular.\nDouglas Harned: And if I can, as a follow-on. In CS, on ENVG, this is something where it seems like we're on the edge of funding being stopped like every time we turn around, but then you get a next award. How do you see the outlook for the night vision goggles there?\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. We're optimistic on the night vision goggles. I think they actually put money in the budget for a change. Usually, it's a zero. And then we go to D.C. and try to get the money put back in. This time, the money is actually in there. I think it's ultimately going to be how IVAS and the virtual reality, augmented reality plays out. I think it's pretty well documented that they're behind schedule, and they're struggling. And the ENVG is a superior product for war fighters. So, I think the two are ultimately going to be used, and there's going to be a convergence. But I think it's safe to say we feel a lot better about the night vision goggle business now, than maybe a year or two ago. And again, some of these DoD procurements are split buys, and we've been winning the majority by a fair amount. As we are meeting our commitments, we're delivering and our competitor is behind. So the Army is always going to award the business, to the company that's delivering and performing. That's what we're doing. And we'll watch it closely, but feel pretty good about it, Doug.\nDouglas Harned: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Matt Akers with Wells Fargo.\nMatthew Akers: Yes, hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. Chris, I want to talk about the progress you guys are making on the cost savings. And obviously, that - a lot of that goes to L3, but a lot of it also goes to your customers, and sort of how they're responding to that? Are they taking notice and better competitiveness maybe helping you convert, on some of those orders you got this quarter?\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. Thanks, Matt. As you would imagine, I and my team spend a lot of time in D.C. and with the customers, and it's always flattering when they ask you how things are going and how LHX NeXt is going, or looking at it not only is it cost savings. But a transformation, the use of digital engineering, the ability to make data-driven decisions more timely. I think it gives Ken and I and the team the flexibility as we roll up our new bids. We know what our labor costs are. We know what our materials, we know what our overhead are, and it allows us to either share some of that with the customer, or bid higher-margin programs. We try to split the two. And based on these book-to-bill rates and the win rates, is clearly giving us an advantage, and couldn't be more excited about it. But it's definitely front and center with everybody we meet with.\nMatthew Akers: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll go next now to David Strauss at Barclays.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.\nChristopher Kubasik: Good morning.\nDavid Strauss: Hi Chris, so far, the margin progress we've seen has been pretty ratable across the individual segments. As you progress from here up about 16%, how do you see that kind of playing out? Do you still see a kind of similar margin opportunity across the individual segments?\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. Yes. We do, David. We see it at the segment level. And of course, we see it at the sector level, we have 13 sectors. And the mantra has been everybody has to improve their margins. We have a toolbox on how to do that. As Ken mentioned, the next phase is on supply-chain, both indirect and direct costs. I'm really excited about that. We've had some early progress, and I think the opportunities are great. Again, the hard part is getting all the data. And once we know how much we spend with each supplier, we're able to sit down and negotiate kind of a win-win situation. So, I'm excited about that. 16 is an interesting number. If we look at our 13 sectors, I don't think there's anybody really close to 16, Ken. There's a bunch of people well above 16 and a bunch of people below 16. So the guys making 11 need to get to 11.2, 11.5, 11.8 [ph], and the people making 25 or 30 need to go to 26 and 32. So everybody is going forward, LHX NeXt, an enterprise-wide initiative, the benefits are spread across the company. And I'm excited about the progress. I don't know, Ken, anything you want to add?\nKenneth Bedingfield: Yes. I was just going to say, in terms of the margin progress, LHX NeXt is certainly a big part of that. But I think at the end of the day, it's also the investments we've made in the team, and the tools are performance on our programs, I think one of the big contributors is just solid performance, getting some of the negative impacts out of the system. We talk about bidding discipline, and I don't want that message to come across, as that means we're not bidding new work. We are bidding. We think we have a more effective cost structure than our peers, and that gives us the ability to win and determine what the right amount of margin opportunity is for us, and what the right amount of lower cost is for the customers. So as I look at it, certainly, a piece of it is avoiding some of the lower margin negative program issues, we saw in the past. Certainly, working with the supply-chain, pricing and inflation. We sort of had to deal with some of the inflationary pressures as an industry back during the pandemic, but we're now new programs able to reflect that more appropriate cost. And again, really focusing on kind of bid to win and knowing what our cost is, and I think having a better view that we are more competitive than many of the peers. So it's kind of that combination of all those various pieces that, I think help us drive to the margin upside, and that's what gives us the confidence in saying, we're going to get to at least that 16% in 2026.\nDavid Strauss: Great. That's helpful. And a quick follow-up for you, Ken. I think you talked about a low double-digit free cash flow per share growth out through '26. It would imply a pretty significant pivot back to share repo kind of soon here as you approach your target leverage, as I just wanted to kind of confirm that.\nKenneth Bedingfield: Yes. Thanks, David. That's confirmed. We talked about $500 million in share repurchases in 2025. We have now hit that target year-to-date - I'm sorry, 2024. We have now hit that target year-to-date. In terms of leverage, we're at 3.1, which is near that 3.0 target that we talked about. That should enable us to get back to more value-creating share repurchase levels in '25 and '26. '24, we mentioned we would be at least kind of offsetting dilution from our equity incentive plans, and that sort of thing. So absolutely, I think you're thinking about it right, and we're excited about this as really what we see as one of the contributors, to value creation for our shareholders, that growing free cash flow per share at solid mid-teen double-digit clip.\nDavid Strauss: Sure. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Michael Ciarmoli at Truist.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Ken, just maybe one quick clarification on the margin performance. Any EACs in the quarter? And then, just on the competitive environment, I guess, specifically as it relates to solid rocket motors. There's been some new entrants. It looks like you've got a collaboration going on with GD and Lockheed and maybe that's targeting your GMLRS program. I mean, I guess I'm just trying to get an update on your sense of confidence in maintaining, or even growing some of your share in Aerojet where you've got seemingly, like I said, some new start entrants, some existing players. So just a general update there?\nKenneth Bedingfield: Yes. Great. Thanks, Michael. I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Chris on some of the new entrant question as well. Look, from a margin perspective and the question about EAC adjustments, we are, as I mentioned, delivering on our programs talked about we did realize some program pressures, in particular, in the space area on a couple of classified programs that we bid a number of years ago. These are very important programs to our customers. I think they enable critical missions, and we're proud of the work that our team does in that area, certainly realizing some schedule pressure and working to accelerate, and that's been driving a little bit of cost on us. But I think it also represents the power of our portfolio, where we were able to work on some of our other programs, realize some upside to more than offset that pressure, and still generate 70 basis points of growth in margin rate year-over-year. In terms of the EACs, we were positive in three of the four segments. As I mentioned, IMS was positive this quarter. I take that as a real good sign about the performance on their programs and the stability that, that team is generating on their performance. SAS, as I mentioned, did realize some challenges and ended up in the red for the third quarter. But again, we're happy that the team is working together, all growing in the same direction to offset. Again, what are those manageable pressures that we see in a significant growth area for this company. In terms of the question on Aerojet and new entrants, I would say, look, we recognize what's going on. Chris has talked about the importance of partnering, with new entrants as a part of our trusted disruptor strategy. We certainly are doing that in Aerojet as well. And we've got a few partnerships that we're working to see if there's more upside than risk in terms of the new entrants. To the question on GMLRS specifically, we see that as a significant growth opportunity in terms of the customer need, and there's been discussion of significant increases in capacity needed there. We are working hard at Aerojet to increase our capacity, and as the customer there is looking at how they get there, they're looking at other opportunities. We're figuring out how we maximize our share of that opportunity. And that's a significant growing market for us, more than we ever anticipated at the time of acquisition, and certainly at the time of diligence. And the team is working hard, to make sure we get at least our fair share of that opportunity.\nChristopher Kubasik: I'll just - Mike will give you a little more GMLRS specifically, which I think is with that joint venture teaming arrangement that you mentioned. The Army has recently been talking about a need for 32,000 solid rocket motors a year. We're currently producing based on our capacity, 8,000. We're making investments to ramp to 10,000 to 14,000 call it 12,000 in the midpoint. There's just more demand there, and there is supply. So we welcome the competition. We think we have the best technology. We have the infrastructure. We're building new buildings. We've already bought equipment to ramp up. And just to put it in perspective, just out of our Camden, Arkansas facility, we delivered 100,000 solid rocket motors a year, 100,000 solid rocket motors. So that's just a data point. It takes a long time to develop new rockets, to get them qualified, get them tested. We welcome the competition, but more pleased with the acquisition of Aerojet today, than I was a couple of years ago. The demand is strong and the team is performing, so awesome [ph].\nMichael Ciarmoli: Great color. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: We'll take our next question now from Gautam Khanna TD Cowen.\nGautam Khanna: Hi, thanks and great results.\nChristopher Kubasik: Thank you.\nGautam Khanna: I wanted to ask just if you can give us an update on Tech Refresh 3 where that stands? And then, if you could also just opine on the margin progress you've made at IMS, and getting some of those challenges that were there last year under control? Thanks.\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. On F-35, I know there's been a lot of discussion on TR-3 in the last several days. I just want to clarify that we're under contract with Lockheed Martin through Lot '19. So we are not experiencing any financial headwinds, or impact from their negotiations. But I will say it's a great team effort. We're all working together on this from the prime to the subs and ourselves, to make sure these aircraft get delivered. And field it as soon as possible. Overall, we're meeting our commitments on TR-3, whether you look at the core processor or the memory system or the cockpit display. So it's been a good effort, to get weekly updates on the progress from the team. And I think the customer's end user and the prime are happy, with what we're doing. So pretty good in that regard. Relative to IMS, you've seen the improvement. They are clearly performing well. We're getting new leadership in place a few years ago. We're investing in systems. The customer relationship is improving. And we're seeing pretty good progress. So pleased with the margins on IMS, and they're kind of getting back to where they were just a few years ago, which again, I don't think anyone thought was possible. But - to elaborate on what Ken was saying it's more than LHX NeXt, it's program execution, it's negotiation. It's identifying when the customer wants changes and getting change orders, they don't want it. We don't get paid for it, we don't do it. but that goes across the board. So good progress all the way around.\nGautam Khanna: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Pete Skibitski at Alembic Global.\nPeter Skibitski: Hi, good morning, guys. Nice quarter.\nKenneth Bedingfield: Thank you, Pete.\nPeter Skibitski: Just wondering at CS, you guys, obviously, kind of broke the year out between first half heavy, domestic mix at tactical radios, second half heavy international and we're seeing that playing out with the margins. Can you give us a sense of how 2025 might play out just versus '24? Do you expect a similar mix, domestic international in '25 versus '24? Or will it shift one way or another? Thanks.\nKenneth Bedingfield: Thanks, Pete. In terms of CS and the margin, I would say a couple of things. One, in terms of '24, we did talk about a profile that was a bit more domestic in the first half, international in the second half, and that's planned out as we expected. Some of the first half domestic heavier mix was a catch-up from a number of international deliveries made in late '23. And then I think the team did a great job in responding quickly, to some of the international demand that we saw. And a number of the awards that CS received in the third quarter, were actually not just booked into opportunities, but they were able to ship products to international customers in the same quarter. I should make sure to highlight that waveform strategy is working. And we saw that play through as a driver of the 26% margins at CS, and over 300 basis point increase in margin year-over-year. To 2025, I would say, look, we'll give more guidance for '25 in January. But I don't necessarily expect to see as much of timing delta between domestic and international quarter-to-quarter, first half, second half. We've got growing demand, both domestically and internationally. And as the team has expanded capacity, expanded testing ability, one of the things that they've done that I think is great at CS is invested in some test capability, where they can test multiple radios on single stands, whether those are for domestic customers or international customers that's driving some efficiency. And because that I think we'll be able to see both growing domestic and international in 2025. Again, as we think about that profile, we'll give you more information in January, but it should be, I would think, a bit more stable in the mix as we look forward.\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes, I'll just chime in. Our confidence in '25, which we'll talk about in January is, is probably going to be better than it has the last couple of years on CS and in particular, the software-defined radio business. If you recall, in '21, '22, the supply chain was really a headwind as we talked about and kind of hard to deliver radio, if you don't have all the parts. But Ken and I were going through some things earlier this week, and I know you're going to find this hard to believe. But Pete, we actually are confident today that our supply-chain is in better shape today, than it was before the pandemic. So you talk about looking for a silver lining in the pandemic, we have a much more resilient supply-chain. We have alternate parts. We've entered long-term strategic agreements where it makes sense. And I think that's going to give us confidence in that particular sector that we didn't have, not only during the pandemic, but before the pandemic. So pretty exciting progress. We don't go back to the norm. It's the new norm, and it's much better in supply-chain than it ever was. So, I thought I'd share that insight.\nPeter Skibitski: Yes. No, that's great. I appreciate it. A quick follow-up. So guys, waveforms - are waveforms now even higher margin than international at this point? I don't know if you want to answer that or not, but the way you're talking it almost seems like it is?\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes, they are.\nPeter Skibitski: Okay. Appreciate it. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Seth Seifman at JPMorgan.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning.\nChristopher Kubasik: Good morning.\nSeth Seifman: Definitely appreciate all the investment that you guys made in Aerojet and the demand there. Just looking specifically at the cadence and in the fourth quarter and just kind of, again, to the low end of the range there, requires a pretty big step-up sequentially and year-over-year. I guess, what kind of gives you the confidence in that? And then, to what degree do we think of that as something that's maybe a seasonal impact, versus something that's kind of breaking free in terms of the pace of sales there?\nKenneth Bedingfield: Yes. Thanks, Seth. I appreciate the question. At AR, we are making really good progress, as we mentioned, I think, in really operationalizing for the capacity and to realize the opportunities that we see. In terms of revenue growth, it does take time to get some of that capacity increase in place. We're starting to see some of the investments that we made pay off, and that should start to kick in from a revenue perspective. They have been working hard on integration and their own piece of cost management, whether that's integration or LHX NeXt and driving that cost down, has been a little bit of a headwind on revenue. As well as some of the - just the legacy contracts that were in place at the time of the acquisition, hanging around for a little longer than we expected that's also been a little bit of a headwind. But as we look forward to the fourth quarter, there's some timing of supply-chain cost flow-through and things like that, that we see giving us confidence to the full year AR revenue range, for the 2024 guide. So we're feeling pretty good about both. I think most importantly, the long-term trajectory and the investments that we're making, to drive our ability to realize that, as well as the full year guide on revenue and margin rate at AR.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next now to Peter Arment at Baird.\nPeter Arment: Thanks. Good morning, Chris and Ken. Really nice results. Hi Chris, maybe just get your latest thoughts on just any sort of updated thoughts on portfolio shaping. You've talked about some businesses that maybe you wanted to potentially divest, and just given LHX NeXt all the progress that you're doing there? Just your latest thoughts there. Appreciate it?\nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. Thanks, Peter. No, we continue to process. We have a couple of smaller properties that are in the market. So I don't know if we'll be able to get anything closed in Q4, we might announce something and we have a process that we're following. None of these would really I don't think be viewed materially $50 million here, $100 million there type thing. But no, we're really refining the portfolio and the amount of management oversight. The time and effort with these small entities and the strategic value to us sometimes doesn't align. But these are good businesses in the right hands. It's always who's the best owner, and we have a handful that we think others would be better owners of. And we'll keep you informed, but I think of it in a couple of hundred million here or there range. I hope that helps, Peter.\nPeter Arment: Yes, I appreciate that. And just a quick follow-up, Ken. Just since you've been now at L3 for just about a year, just how you're thinking about the opportunities with working capital, and I know you touched upon the free cash flow growth and - just your latest thoughts there? Have you seen any opportunities without LHX NeXt, et cetera?\nKenneth Bedingfield: Yes. Thanks. From a working capital perspective, we certainly want to be effective managers of the capital required to run the business. That being said, we are working on our plan for profitable growth, and that takes some investment. And at times, that means now kind of investing in the business, whether that's CapEx, or working capital to drive those growth opportunities. And we're willing to make those investments. We look at that and we see it as being a part of this free cash flow growth that we drive, probably with growth in operating income, driven by, again, that profitable growth at the top line flowing through, with increasing margins as the biggest contributor to the free cash flow growth, but then also effective working capital management being a part of that. But I want to be clear, we are not short termists in terms of working capital. We think about the health of this business for the long-term, and we make those important and hard decisions to invest. And that is enabled by LHX NeXt, managing every dollar of cost. And as we've made difficult decisions around our workforce, around our infrastructure, around the tools that we're investing in to drive benefits and supply chain. All of those things enable us to make the investments needed to drive profitable growth. So, we feel really good about it. The team certainly knows how to do effective working capital management. But really, the growth in the income profit is the biggest contributor to that growing working - I'm sorry, growing free cash flow that we see.\nPeter Arment: Appreciate all the color. Thanks guys.\nChristopher Kubasik: Bob, let's take the last question.\nOperator: Certainly, we'll take that question now from Jason Gursky at Citi.\nJeremy Jason: Hi guys. This is Jeremy Jason for Jason Gursky today. Thanks for taking me in. I was just wondering if you could provide an update on the trends going on with TDL, Link 16 and your efforts with the proliferated water fighter space architecture programs. You guys have made some like good strides here, and have been investing in facilities to support them. So I was just kind of curious, if things have been tracking as planned? Or what do you think might be next for the company in this area? Thanks.\nChristopher Kubasik: Okay. Thanks for the question. We actually just reviewed the TDL business case with our Board of Directors. We're actually a little ahead of the business case that we presented. We successfully moved everything into our Salt Lake City facility. As part of that process, we streamlined the flow in the operations, hours are down, supply-chain leverage improving, and we've received significant orders. There's a product called BATS-D, it's a handheld Link 16 sold the first one in a long, long time or actually lots of them in a while. So we're really happy with the progress we've made there, Link 16 demos and space are going well. And I talked earlier about making acquisitions that align with national defense and security, and being aligned with the budget and the customer. And here's a perfect example, resilient communications. You've heard us say it for years. I'm telling you that's the future. We're in the sweet spot. We have the technology. We got the workforce, we've got the capability, and we're starting to see it pay off. So, I think with that, I'll just wrap up before concluding, and take a moment to acknowledge the efforts of the team, their dedication and innovation continue to drive our success, and transform not only our country, but the industry. This quarter, in particular, we faced significant challenges from tornadoes to hurricanes, yet our teams have consistently risen to the occasion. This resilience of overcoming obstacles is a testament to the strength and adaptability of the workforce, could not be prouder of what we've accomplished together. So despite these challenges, we've made tremendous progress. I'm confident that we're well positioned to build on this momentum in the years ahead. And I thank everybody for joining the call, and we'll talk to you again in January.\nOperator: Thank you, Mr. Kubasik. Ladies and gentlemen, again, that does conclude the L3Harris Technologies third quarter earnings call. Again, thanks so much for joining us, everyone, and we wish you all a great day. Goodbye.",

            "name": "Kenneth Bedingfield",
            "content": "Thanks Chris. We're on track to exceed our 2024 run rate cost savings target of $400 million, and now expect to achieve at least $600 million by the end of the year. We are also confident in our ability to reach our $1 billion cost savings target a year early, and our pipeline provides opportunity for additional cost savings, to exceed the $1 billion target. The accelerated savings give us confidence that, we will surpass the segment operating margin target of 16% that we set at our Investor Day, and we now expect to achieve at least 16% in 2026. This performance highlights, our ongoing commitment to transforming the way we work, improving operational efficiency and program management, as well as aggressively managing all costs delivering value to our shareholders. We are realizing the power of real-time data across all of our systems, ERP, manufacturing engineering, to name a few and even our products, for better decision making. Moving into the next phase of LHX NeXt, our primary focus has shifted from workforce optimization to strengthening supply-chain management, and modernizing our digital infrastructure. By leveraging the scale of our enterprise using modern AI-enabled tools from partners like Palantir, we are improving cost, quality and delivery times for our customers. At the same time, this creates demand stability for our suppliers, giving them the opportunity to grow alongside us. Supply-chain management is becoming a competitive differentiator. Back to you Chris. As we look ahead to next year, we anticipate growth across key financial metrics including revenue, segment operating margin, EPS and free cash flow. We're on track to achieve our 2026 framework of $23 billion in revenue, at least 16% segment operating margin and $2.8 billion in free cash flow. We do expect the growth rate in '26 to exceed 2025, given budgetary and political dynamics over the next few months. We'll provide more detailed 2025 guidance in January, but these commitments are a testament to our ongoing focus on disciplined growth and profitability. Our financial framework anticipates mid-single-digit organic revenue growth, continued margin expansion and low-double-digit free cash flow growth, as we achieve our targets. As we reach our near term target debt leverage ratio of 3.0, and deploy excess capital to repurchase shares, our free cash flow per share growth, will accelerate into the mid-double-digits over a 2023 baseline. Let's dive into consolidated results for the third quarter, our fifth straight quarter of strong delivery of financial results versus expectations. We're continuing to see strong demand across the board, with new awards totaling over $7 billion this quarter. This allowed us to achieve an overall company book-to-bill of 1.4 with all four segments delivering book-to-bill of at least one. Our Aerojet Rocketdyne and Communication Systems segments had particularly strong bookings this past quarter, with both recording book-to-bill well above 1.5. Our total backlog has now reached a new record of $34 billion. Turning to the financials, consolidated revenue increased by 8% in the third quarter. Operating margins improved to 15.7%, an impressive 70 basis point increase driven by continuing program execution, and operational performance with strong contributions from LHX NeXt. Non-GAAP EPS grew by 5%, and on a pension adjusted basis our EPS increased by 8%. Our performance so far in '24 puts us on track to achieve the top end, of our full year guidance range of 9% to 11% pension adjusted EPS growth. We believe this is the best economic measure of our earnings per share, highlighting how our disciplined focus is delivering strong bottom line results. We recognize the need to take on risk to grow, and as you can see from this quarter's results, we are managing our portfolio to enable profitable growth and limit risk to digestible single-digit and low-double-digit millions. We generated over $700 million of free cash flow this quarter, with adjusted free cash flow of $728 million primarily driven by increased operating income, and effective working capital management. And we reduced overall debt by $325 million during the quarter, reducing our net leverage to 3.1 nearing our target. Turning to segment performance, we saw strong growth in CS with revenue up 10%, supported by increased domestic and international demand for resilient communications equipment, and related waveforms as well as higher volumes for night vision devices. At IMS, revenue is up 7% year-over-year. This was driven by increased volume of avionics products, higher aircraft integration volume for international and domestic customers, and increased volume for advanced electronics for space and munitions programs. SAS revenue was about flat, due to the divestiture of the antenna business in Q2, lower F-35 related volumes as TR-3 development ramps down and a few challenges on classified development programs in our space business. This was offset by classified program growth in Intel and cyber, and increased volume supporting FAA mission-critical safety of flight networks. On an organic basis, revenue growth for SAS was 2%. Aerojet Rocketdyne contributed approximately $600 million to our overall revenue this quarter. We are pleased with the segment's performance and have booked significant new business to support future profitable growth as Chris mentioned. All right, turning our attention to margins, CS delivered excellent margins of 26%, a 350 basis point improvement year-over-year, driven by strong performance from higher volumes, favorable high margin, international mix, proprietary waveform license sales and LHX NeXt cost savings. Waveform sales, a focused effort in the last few years are demonstrating our effective transition from hardware centric to software enabled products. IMS also performed well reporting margins of 12.2%, up 30 basis points from the previous year, primarily due to improved program execution driving net positive EAC adjustments in the quarter, as well as LHX NeXt contributions and favorable mix in our commercial aviation solutions business. SAS margins declined to 11.6, largely due to a one-time license sale in the prior year, and the previously mentioned challenges on classified development programs in our space business, partially offset by LHX NeXt savings. Aerojet Rocketdyne delivered margins of 12.6%, which included $11 million of benefit from amortization of off market purchase price adjustments. I'll remind you that these adjustments, were always considered in our guidance. As PPA amortizes off, we continue to expect economic profit of new programs to fill in the gap. Turning to guidance. Given our strong performance so far this year, we are increasing guidance again. We now expect total company revenue of $21.1 million to $21.3 billion, segment operating margin of approximately 15.5%, EPS in the range of $12.95 to $13.15 per share, and we're reiterating free cash flow guidance of $2.2 billion. You can find additional segment guidance details in the earnings release, and presentation on our website. Overall, we're extremely pleased with our strong performance so far this year. Reflecting on the progress the team has made, since I joined L3Harris nearly a year ago. I'm truly impressed, by how we've built on our strengths. Our agility and ability to make fast informed decisions, are clear differentiators and it's this culture of innovation, responsiveness, decisive leadership and being a platform agnostic, honest broker that enables this company to deliver on our customers most mission critical needs, while staying fully aligned with the commitments we've made, to our stakeholders. Looking ahead, I'm more and more confident about L3Harris trajectory. We've established ourselves as the trusted disruptor in the industry, continually pushing to disrupt through innovation, while maintaining a trusted and disciplined focus on operational excellence, and financial performance. The future of L3Harris is bright, and this team will continue to unlock new opportunities to drive sustained value. With that back to you, Chris. Yes. Thanks, Chris, and thanks for the question, Myles. Good morning. In terms of the margin flow-through, I would say we are absolutely tracking to the target that we set. And I think the team is working aggressively, to try to realize additional margin opportunity out of the savings either through, or through a combination of over delivery of the ultimate target. As well as making sure that we can realize as much of the opportunity, in turning the savings into margins as possible. We'll give more detail on 2025 guidance in January. We mentioned in the remarks that 2026 margin target has moved, from approximately 16% to at least 16%. And as we think about that, it won't necessarily be a linear path, but we certainly see opportunity for margin improvement in '25 as well. Remember, these are run rate savings, so we expect them to recur and certainly have long-term benefit. We're certainly focused on the long-term, but we will see benefit in '25 flow-through. And just as we look at it, again, the program is really performing well. The team is firing on all cylinders, and really feel like it's delivering the results that we need. Sure. Thanks. Yes, we're using a Palantir product. We call it the unified data layer, as I mentioned in my remarks, and enables us to look across all of our systems, whether those are ERP systems, manufacturing systems, engineering, labor, other, even to the point Chris talked about in terms of some of the customer opportunities, looking across the data generated out of our products in order to do some of the advanced targeting, real-time targeting and things like that, that are subject to the strategic partnership. But again, back to some of the internals, we're using that data to make real-time, data-driven decisions to drive cost down. We've seen that as a contributor in identifying not only areas for labor efficiencies, factory efficiencies, process improvements, but it is contributing significantly to the supply-chain effort as well. So really excited about the partnership. I think it's one of these where there's certainly benefit on the customer side, and we are realizing that benefit upfront in our internal operations to really show how it will actually operationalize itself for our customers. Yes, Doug, just to put a couple of numbers on the U.S. side, to your question about Army and Marine Corps, in particular, the DoD has a modernization cycle. We think that's just shy of 500,000 radios in the current cycle. And almost 150,000 of those have been awarded. We have seen about three-quarters of those about 75% coming to L3Harris, that leaves somewhere shy of 300,000 radios to go. So just put a little bit of numbers behind Chris' comments on the U.S. market, I feel really good about that modernization cycle, and how we're doing against the competitive landscape there. You may remember, there's a competitor or two in the handhelds as well as a different set of Manpack and Vehicular. Yes. I was just going to say, in terms of the margin progress, LHX NeXt is certainly a big part of that. But I think at the end of the day, it's also the investments we've made in the team, and the tools are performance on our programs, I think one of the big contributors is just solid performance, getting some of the negative impacts out of the system. We talk about bidding discipline, and I don't want that message to come across, as that means we're not bidding new work. We are bidding. We think we have a more effective cost structure than our peers, and that gives us the ability to win and determine what the right amount of margin opportunity is for us, and what the right amount of lower cost is for the customers. So as I look at it, certainly, a piece of it is avoiding some of the lower margin negative program issues, we saw in the past. Certainly, working with the supply-chain, pricing and inflation. We sort of had to deal with some of the inflationary pressures as an industry back during the pandemic, but we're now new programs able to reflect that more appropriate cost. And again, really focusing on kind of bid to win and knowing what our cost is, and I think having a better view that we are more competitive than many of the peers. So it's kind of that combination of all those various pieces that, I think help us drive to the margin upside, and that's what gives us the confidence in saying, we're going to get to at least that 16% in 2026. Yes. Thanks, David. That's confirmed. We talked about $500 million in share repurchases in 2025. We have now hit that target year-to-date - I'm sorry, 2024. We have now hit that target year-to-date. In terms of leverage, we're at 3.1, which is near that 3.0 target that we talked about. That should enable us to get back to more value-creating share repurchase levels in '25 and '26. '24, we mentioned we would be at least kind of offsetting dilution from our equity incentive plans, and that sort of thing. So absolutely, I think you're thinking about it right, and we're excited about this as really what we see as one of the contributors, to value creation for our shareholders, that growing free cash flow per share at solid mid-teen double-digit clip. Yes. Great. Thanks, Michael. I'll start and then I'll turn it over to Chris on some of the new entrant question as well. Look, from a margin perspective and the question about EAC adjustments, we are, as I mentioned, delivering on our programs talked about we did realize some program pressures, in particular, in the space area on a couple of classified programs that we bid a number of years ago. These are very important programs to our customers. I think they enable critical missions, and we're proud of the work that our team does in that area, certainly realizing some schedule pressure and working to accelerate, and that's been driving a little bit of cost on us. But I think it also represents the power of our portfolio, where we were able to work on some of our other programs, realize some upside to more than offset that pressure, and still generate 70 basis points of growth in margin rate year-over-year. In terms of the EACs, we were positive in three of the four segments. As I mentioned, IMS was positive this quarter. I take that as a real good sign about the performance on their programs and the stability that, that team is generating on their performance. SAS, as I mentioned, did realize some challenges and ended up in the red for the third quarter. But again, we're happy that the team is working together, all growing in the same direction to offset. Again, what are those manageable pressures that we see in a significant growth area for this company. In terms of the question on Aerojet and new entrants, I would say, look, we recognize what's going on. Chris has talked about the importance of partnering, with new entrants as a part of our trusted disruptor strategy. We certainly are doing that in Aerojet as well. And we've got a few partnerships that we're working to see if there's more upside than risk in terms of the new entrants. To the question on GMLRS specifically, we see that as a significant growth opportunity in terms of the customer need, and there's been discussion of significant increases in capacity needed there. We are working hard at Aerojet to increase our capacity, and as the customer there is looking at how they get there, they're looking at other opportunities. We're figuring out how we maximize our share of that opportunity. And that's a significant growing market for us, more than we ever anticipated at the time of acquisition, and certainly at the time of diligence. And the team is working hard, to make sure we get at least our fair share of that opportunity. Thank you, Pete. Thanks, Pete. In terms of CS and the margin, I would say a couple of things. One, in terms of '24, we did talk about a profile that was a bit more domestic in the first half, international in the second half, and that's planned out as we expected. Some of the first half domestic heavier mix was a catch-up from a number of international deliveries made in late '23. And then I think the team did a great job in responding quickly, to some of the international demand that we saw. And a number of the awards that CS received in the third quarter, were actually not just booked into opportunities, but they were able to ship products to international customers in the same quarter. I should make sure to highlight that waveform strategy is working. And we saw that play through as a driver of the 26% margins at CS, and over 300 basis point increase in margin year-over-year. To 2025, I would say, look, we'll give more guidance for '25 in January. But I don't necessarily expect to see as much of timing delta between domestic and international quarter-to-quarter, first half, second half. We've got growing demand, both domestically and internationally. And as the team has expanded capacity, expanded testing ability, one of the things that they've done that I think is great at CS is invested in some test capability, where they can test multiple radios on single stands, whether those are for domestic customers or international customers that's driving some efficiency. And because that I think we'll be able to see both growing domestic and international in 2025. Again, as we think about that profile, we'll give you more information in January, but it should be, I would think, a bit more stable in the mix as we look forward. Yes. Thanks, Seth. I appreciate the question. At AR, we are making really good progress, as we mentioned, I think, in really operationalizing for the capacity and to realize the opportunities that we see. In terms of revenue growth, it does take time to get some of that capacity increase in place. We're starting to see some of the investments that we made pay off, and that should start to kick in from a revenue perspective. They have been working hard on integration and their own piece of cost management, whether that's integration or LHX NeXt and driving that cost down, has been a little bit of a headwind on revenue. As well as some of the - just the legacy contracts that were in place at the time of the acquisition, hanging around for a little longer than we expected that's also been a little bit of a headwind. But as we look forward to the fourth quarter, there's some timing of supply-chain cost flow-through and things like that, that we see giving us confidence to the full year AR revenue range, for the 2024 guide. So we're feeling pretty good about both. I think most importantly, the long-term trajectory and the investments that we're making, to drive our ability to realize that, as well as the full year guide on revenue and margin rate at AR. Yes. Thanks. From a working capital perspective, we certainly want to be effective managers of the capital required to run the business. That being said, we are working on our plan for profitable growth, and that takes some investment. And at times, that means now kind of investing in the business, whether that's CapEx, or working capital to drive those growth opportunities. And we're willing to make those investments. We look at that and we see it as being a part of this free cash flow growth that we drive, probably with growth in operating income, driven by, again, that profitable growth at the top line flowing through, with increasing margins as the biggest contributor to the free cash flow growth, but then also effective working capital management being a part of that. But I want to be clear, we are not short termists in terms of working capital. We think about the health of this business for the long-term, and we make those important and hard decisions to invest. And that is enabled by LHX NeXt, managing every dollar of cost. And as we've made difficult decisions around our workforce, around our infrastructure, around the tools that we're investing in to drive benefits and supply chain. All of those things enable us to make the investments needed to drive profitable growth. So, we feel really good about it. The team certainly knows how to do effective working capital management. But really, the growth in the income profit is the biggest contributor to that growing working - I'm sorry, growing free cash flow that we see."

            "name": "Christopher Kubasik",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thanks Dan. We had a very strong quarter, and our strategy is delivering results. We achieved record order volume, an impressive book-to-bill, robust segment operating margins and solid free cash flow. We're proud of the progress we've made so far this year, and are confident that we are on track to deliver on the commitments we made to our stakeholders. Our customers tell us that we're agile, fast and fully aligned with their priorities. This empowers us to deliver the right capabilities at the right time, meeting the evolving needs of our nation and its allies. Our business model enables us to operate, as either a prime, a sub or merchant supplier, offering commercial pricing or utilizing the traditional government acquisition approach. This flexibility in our platform agnostic approach, gives us a unique advantage in rapidly adapting to the changing threat environment, and addressing our customers mission critical needs. It also enables us to effectively partner with new entrants, and non-traditional contractors. We've made key acquisitions including Aerojet Rocketdyne and Tactical Data Links, while simultaneously divesting non-core assets. These moves have allowed us to further hone our portfolio, to reinforce our national security focus. Our capabilities in areas like resilient communications, munitions, space, ISR and passive sensing are innovative, allowing us to deliver solutions across all domains, and providing our customers with superiority across the entirety, of the electromagnetic spectrum. Our diversified portfolio limits our reliance on a single program, enabling steady growth with lower variability and a greater ability to manage risk over the long-term. Partnerships are a hallmark of our trusted disruptor strategy. On Wednesday, we announced a strategic partnership with Palantir, working together to deliver advanced solutions to our customers. In fact, yesterday the White House ordered the Pentagon and the Intel agencies to increase the use of AI. So, I feel we're well positioned in this evolving market. We continue to focus on profitable growth. This approach allows us to grow, while delivering sustained margin improvement, which will drive financial outperformance. Growth for growth's sake is not our strategy. We prioritize profitable growth that drives appropriate returns, and cash generation. Our strategy to act as a sub or merchant supplier, also enables us to participate in key strategic programs even when we choose not to Prime. I'm pleased to report that we've made considerable progress on our innovative LHX NeXt program, to transform L3Harris and how we operate. Ken, would you like to elaborate? We had several key wins during the quarter. In our Communications segment, we won a $600 million Next Generation Jammer contract. Following the cost plus development phase, it will enable L3Harris to establish a long-term jamming franchise, worth billions of dollars in high margin production of airborne pods. These types of wins are critical to driving sustained long-term profitable growth, and reinforce the strength and diversity of our technology portfolio. Another highlight this quarter, was securing one of two positions on a $1.2 billion IDIQ contract, with the U.S. Navy to provide support for the P-8A Poseidon fleet. This contract strengthens our relationship with the Navy within the ISR sector. On the international front, we were awarded three contracts for software defined tactical radios, by NATO allies totaling over $400 million. We began deliveries in the quarter again displaying the speed at, which we can provide capabilities to our customers. The international demand for these resilient software defined radios, with our proprietary waveforms highlights our leading capability in low probability of detect, and low probability of INTERCEPT communications. This is driving our allies to choose L3Harris solutions, over indigenous products with increased frequency. Over the last several years, we have strategically invested in a new mission set bringing important capabilities in space-based missile warning, and missile tracking leading to orders for 50 satellites, five of which are in orbit. Our advanced solid rocket motor technology, also plays a critical role in this mission set, demonstrating our leadership in advanced missile and missile defense technology including hypersonics, counter hypersonics and precise attitude control. This is illustrated by our recent win on the Glide Phase Interceptor contract, as part of an industry team where we will provide two critical propulsion systems, including a large solid rocket motor for the first stage, and an advanced motor to power the third stage of the interceptor missile. This interceptor will defense against hypersonic glide vehicles, a real threat in today's environment. The Glide Phase Interceptor Award establishes another long-term propulsion franchise, alongside our next generation interceptor win earlier this year, where we were part of a different industry team. With that, I'd like to turn it back to Ken. I want to reinforce that our mission is clear. We are here to deliver for our customer's mission critical needs, in an increasingly complex global threat environment. We are proud to be at the forefront, helping to build our nation's next arsenal of democracy. Unlike World War II, it's more than just building platforms. It's the convergence of hardware, software and AI. And we're uniquely positioned for the future. Our team's work is vital to helping the warfighter, ensure the safety and security of our nation and its allies. And we remain fully committed, to delivering the technologies and solutions that will protect and defend democracy. Bob, let's open the line for questions. All right, good morning Sheila and thanks for the question. Yes, if you recall in 2023, we had a book-to-bill of 1.21. We're sitting at 1.14 after nine months. And as Ken said, we have a record backlog I believe when I look at our portfolio that we are aligned with the important areas of the U.S. budget, and that will allow us to grow and meet our $23 billion commitment. When I look at CS, we talked about the NATO software-defined radios. There are other opportunities in Europe that we're looking at right now. And just like we talked about last time, we still have a $10 billion international pipeline in CS alone. On the space side, I think there's some well-documented budget pressures here in the near term. But I think given the threat environment. And as the customer continues to move missions from air to space, by 2026, we should be able to see more growth in the out years. In Aerojet Rocketdyne, the operations are improving. We're testing in the supply-chain. We're investing in capacity. That expansion should hit us in 2026, which will enable us to accelerate growth. I mentioned the Glide Phase Interceptor and the next-gen interceptor as well. So, those are large solid rocket motor opportunities that are very, very significant. And then, of course, in IMS, we always have international ISR opportunities, which are a little lumpy. But given our good performance so far in that market, I think that can provide us upside as well. Yes. Let me start with that, Myles, good morning. Then I'll let can give a little more detail. But this is the top priority for me, and the entire leadership team. I've talked in the past as to how we did the easy part of integration shortly after the merger, and we were disrupted with the pandemic. And this is really a Phase 2 of the integration, which we've now talking about the transformation of L3Harris. We are looking at every single function, every line of business. We're down to policies, systems, and really just focused on eliminating non-value, or waste in the systems. So we've been very aggressive. We have a dedicated leader and team focused on this 24/7, and you're starting to see the results. I think there was a lot of skepticism. I'm proud of the team. I'm proud of the fact we're ahead of schedule, and it's quite exciting, and we're going to continue to push to achieve that $1 billion next year. And more thereafter, but I'll let Ken talk about the margin impact. Yes. No, Richard, thanks. There is no upfront investment, or capital for this. This relationship goes back about five years. And before we signed a strategic relationship with another company, we wanted to make sure that the cultures are aligned, our focus on mission was aligned, and there's just a lot of great team work, not only at the top of the two organizations, but throughout the organization. So based on that, we wanted to take it to the next level. This will be both teams looking for opportunities to bid. We have one program where Palantir is the prime Titan. It's a mobile vehicular mobile network, where we're a sub providing the resilient comms, the comms architecture, the comm hardware. There are other programs where we're going to prime, and then there's R&D projects we're working on together. So I would say it's businesses as usual, and it's really putting the two capabilities together. As far as the strategic rationale, I mean, could not have timed to the White House announcement any better that I referenced, if you hadn't had a chance to look at it. I mean they are really putting the pressure on the DoD and the Intel agencies, to use AI more. And I think what our secret sauce is, there's no one company that can do it all. They may think they can, but there really isn't. And our strategy of partnering and working with the best companies in a platform-agnostic manner, I think, is a key differentiator. And to have the AI skills and the algorithms, and the large language models that they have is literally billions of dollars. I don't have billions of dollars in five or 10 years to build it. So, we ought to team and work collaboratively, and could not be more excited about that. Maybe I'll let Ken - and I talked about the customer side, and we also received a few calls from customers as early as yesterday, shortly after the announcement. There's a lot of excitement about this, and couldn't be more proud of the team. But we're also using their products internally as part of LHX NeXt. I don't know, Ken, do you want to give just a couple of examples of how that's helping us. And I'll just chime in. We recently rolled out a - for our program managers and their financial analysts, the ability to get data even more timely, real-time. And at the end of the day, Rich, it's all about managing your programs. And the earlier you can get the data, the earlier you can identify opportunities and risks, the easier it is to either realize those opportunities, or mitigate the risks. And it's always been a struggle in this industry to get timely data and it's exciting. Our 800 financial analysts have real-time data, and I think it's going to make a difference in our operations in a positive way. Good morning. Yes. Let me - we'll start with the U.S., where we can't agree whether we're in the bottom of the third or the top of the fourth, but somewhere between those two is where I think we're positioned here with the DoD. There's still a lot of strong demand. I'm proud of the team. We're now upselling our latest waveforms. In addition, to just the software-defined radios, sometimes thought of as hardware, although it's all about the waveforms. That gives us a great, great market opportunity. And every time there's an annual buy. We continue to win. So I'm pretty excited there. I'd say on NATO, it's probably even earlier, or maybe the second inning. And what we're really seeing, is the interoperability absolutely critical within the NATO countries, our resilience, our crypto mods. These are all reasons why NATO countries are selecting us, over their indigenous radio providers, it's a huge, huge opportunity. In fact, we recently won a program with the Netherlands for $1.4 billion over 10 years. That's going through the congressional U.S. Congressional notification process. I think one of the key lessons learned coming out of Ukraine, is the need for this interoperability and the need for resilient comms. And majority of the NATO countries are, in fact, not only signing up, but spending the 2% of GDP that they committed to. We have a couple of opportunities that we won here in Q4, already in Eastern Europe. The pipeline is healthy, and we're real, real excited about the software-defined tactical radio business. And as I said, $10 billion international pipeline. Ken? Yes. We're optimistic on the night vision goggles. I think they actually put money in the budget for a change. Usually, it's a zero. And then we go to D.C. and try to get the money put back in. This time, the money is actually in there. I think it's ultimately going to be how IVAS and the virtual reality, augmented reality plays out. I think it's pretty well documented that they're behind schedule, and they're struggling. And the ENVG is a superior product for war fighters. So, I think the two are ultimately going to be used, and there's going to be a convergence. But I think it's safe to say we feel a lot better about the night vision goggle business now, than maybe a year or two ago. And again, some of these DoD procurements are split buys, and we've been winning the majority by a fair amount. As we are meeting our commitments, we're delivering and our competitor is behind. So the Army is always going to award the business, to the company that's delivering and performing. That's what we're doing. And we'll watch it closely, but feel pretty good about it, Doug. Yes. Thanks, Matt. As you would imagine, I and my team spend a lot of time in D.C. and with the customers, and it's always flattering when they ask you how things are going and how LHX NeXt is going, or looking at it not only is it cost savings. But a transformation, the use of digital engineering, the ability to make data-driven decisions more timely. I think it gives Ken and I and the team the flexibility as we roll up our new bids. We know what our labor costs are. We know what our materials, we know what our overhead are, and it allows us to either share some of that with the customer, or bid higher-margin programs. We try to split the two. And based on these book-to-bill rates and the win rates, is clearly giving us an advantage, and couldn't be more excited about it. But it's definitely front and center with everybody we meet with. Good morning. Yes. Yes. We do, David. We see it at the segment level. And of course, we see it at the sector level, we have 13 sectors. And the mantra has been everybody has to improve their margins. We have a toolbox on how to do that. As Ken mentioned, the next phase is on supply-chain, both indirect and direct costs. I'm really excited about that. We've had some early progress, and I think the opportunities are great. Again, the hard part is getting all the data. And once we know how much we spend with each supplier, we're able to sit down and negotiate kind of a win-win situation. So, I'm excited about that. 16 is an interesting number. If we look at our 13 sectors, I don't think there's anybody really close to 16, Ken. There's a bunch of people well above 16 and a bunch of people below 16. So the guys making 11 need to get to 11.2, 11.5, 11.8 [ph], and the people making 25 or 30 need to go to 26 and 32. So everybody is going forward, LHX NeXt, an enterprise-wide initiative, the benefits are spread across the company. And I'm excited about the progress. I don't know, Ken, anything you want to add? I'll just - Mike will give you a little more GMLRS specifically, which I think is with that joint venture teaming arrangement that you mentioned. The Army has recently been talking about a need for 32,000 solid rocket motors a year. We're currently producing based on our capacity, 8,000. We're making investments to ramp to 10,000 to 14,000 call it 12,000 in the midpoint. There's just more demand there, and there is supply. So we welcome the competition. We think we have the best technology. We have the infrastructure. We're building new buildings. We've already bought equipment to ramp up. And just to put it in perspective, just out of our Camden, Arkansas facility, we delivered 100,000 solid rocket motors a year, 100,000 solid rocket motors. So that's just a data point. It takes a long time to develop new rockets, to get them qualified, get them tested. We welcome the competition, but more pleased with the acquisition of Aerojet today, than I was a couple of years ago. The demand is strong and the team is performing, so awesome [ph]. Thank you. Yes. On F-35, I know there's been a lot of discussion on TR-3 in the last several days. I just want to clarify that we're under contract with Lockheed Martin through Lot '19. So we are not experiencing any financial headwinds, or impact from their negotiations. But I will say it's a great team effort. We're all working together on this from the prime to the subs and ourselves, to make sure these aircraft get delivered. And field it as soon as possible. Overall, we're meeting our commitments on TR-3, whether you look at the core processor or the memory system or the cockpit display. So it's been a good effort, to get weekly updates on the progress from the team. And I think the customer's end user and the prime are happy, with what we're doing. So pretty good in that regard. Relative to IMS, you've seen the improvement. They are clearly performing well. We're getting new leadership in place a few years ago. We're investing in systems. The customer relationship is improving. And we're seeing pretty good progress. So pleased with the margins on IMS, and they're kind of getting back to where they were just a few years ago, which again, I don't think anyone thought was possible. But - to elaborate on what Ken was saying it's more than LHX NeXt, it's program execution, it's negotiation. It's identifying when the customer wants changes and getting change orders, they don't want it. We don't get paid for it, we don't do it. but that goes across the board. So good progress all the way around. Yes, I'll just chime in. Our confidence in '25, which we'll talk about in January is, is probably going to be better than it has the last couple of years on CS and in particular, the software-defined radio business. If you recall, in '21, '22, the supply chain was really a headwind as we talked about and kind of hard to deliver radio, if you don't have all the parts. But Ken and I were going through some things earlier this week, and I know you're going to find this hard to believe. But Pete, we actually are confident today that our supply-chain is in better shape today, than it was before the pandemic. So you talk about looking for a silver lining in the pandemic, we have a much more resilient supply-chain. We have alternate parts. We've entered long-term strategic agreements where it makes sense. And I think that's going to give us confidence in that particular sector that we didn't have, not only during the pandemic, but before the pandemic. So pretty exciting progress. We don't go back to the norm. It's the new norm, and it's much better in supply-chain than it ever was. So, I thought I'd share that insight. Yes, they are. Good morning. Yes. Thanks, Peter. No, we continue to process. We have a couple of smaller properties that are in the market. So I don't know if we'll be able to get anything closed in Q4, we might announce something and we have a process that we're following. None of these would really I don't think be viewed materially $50 million here, $100 million there type thing. But no, we're really refining the portfolio and the amount of management oversight. The time and effort with these small entities and the strategic value to us sometimes doesn't align. But these are good businesses in the right hands. It's always who's the best owner, and we have a handful that we think others would be better owners of. And we'll keep you informed, but I think of it in a couple of hundred million here or there range. I hope that helps, Peter. Bob, let's take the last question. Okay. Thanks for the question. We actually just reviewed the TDL business case with our Board of Directors. We're actually a little ahead of the business case that we presented. We successfully moved everything into our Salt Lake City facility. As part of that process, we streamlined the flow in the operations, hours are down, supply-chain leverage improving, and we've received significant orders. There's a product called BATS-D, it's a handheld Link 16 sold the first one in a long, long time or actually lots of them in a while. So we're really happy with the progress we've made there, Link 16 demos and space are going well. And I talked earlier about making acquisitions that align with national defense and security, and being aligned with the budget and the customer. And here's a perfect example, resilient communications. You've heard us say it for years. I'm telling you that's the future. We're in the sweet spot. We have the technology. We got the workforce, we've got the capability, and we're starting to see it pay off. So, I think with that, I'll just wrap up before concluding, and take a moment to acknowledge the efforts of the team, their dedication and innovation continue to drive our success, and transform not only our country, but the industry. This quarter, in particular, we faced significant challenges from tornadoes to hurricanes, yet our teams have consistently risen to the occasion. This resilience of overcoming obstacles is a testament to the strength and adaptability of the workforce, could not be prouder of what we've accomplished together. So despite these challenges, we've made tremendous progress. I'm confident that we're well positioned to build on this momentum in the years ahead. And I thank everybody for joining the call, and we'll talk to you again in January."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Danny Gittsovich, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you Dan, you may now begin.\nDaniel Gittsovich: Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to our Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me this morning are Chris Kubasik, our CEO; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. Yesterday we published our second quarter earnings release detailing our financial results and guidance. We have also provided a supplemental earnings presentation on our website. Today's discussion will include certain matters that constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks, assumptions, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please reference our earnings release and SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures which are reconciled to GAAP measures in the earnings release. For those of you I haven\u2019t met yet, I am new in this role and look forward to engaging with you in the near future. I'd now like to turn it over to Chris for some remarks.\nChristopher E. Kubasik: Thanks, Dan and welcome to the IR team and your first earnings call with us. Last month marked the five-year anniversary of the transformative merger between L3 and Harris, and the creation of the industry's trusted disruptor, a proven alternative to both traditional primes and new entrants, focused on relentless innovation to deliver capability with the speed, passion, and determination that our customers demand in executing their most challenging missions. Unlike traditional primes and new commercial entrants, we utilize both commercial and government business models with significant presence in each. We deliver commercial short cycle products, such as software-defined radios. We also execute on critical long-term programs that span the entire life cycle from development to production, including international exports, and ultimately sustainment and support. Our diverse and platform agnostic portfolio enables us to work across the ecosystem as a prime, a sub, or a merchant supplier to deliver the best solutions for our customers and the best returns for our shareholders. Further, as the trusted disruptor, we are actively looking for opportunities to partner with small and large companies where it makes business sense. It was one year ago that we announced the successful addition of Aerojet Rocketdyne to the L3Harris portfolio. This acquisition increases our content on missile platforms and positions us for growth in new markets. A recent example is our role on the missile defense agencies' next-generation interceptor program. This leverages our industry-leading propulsion technology and innovative attitude control systems to defend against long-range ballistic missile threats. We are also integrating legacy L3Harris electronics capabilities. Since closing the acquisition, and as we've discussed on our last two earnings calls, we've made substantial progress in improving the operational performance of the business, and we continue to make investments to increase capacity and drive efficiencies to meet our customers growing demand, including the expansion of key facilities in Arkansas, Alabama, and Virginia. As a result of these combined efforts, we have reduced overdue deliveries by nearly 40% in the past 12 months. Several of you had a chance to visit our inert center of excellence in Huntsville, Alabama, and we know you left with a better understanding of the business and the progress to date. Since the merger, we focused on integrating and shaping the portfolio to align with national security priorities and the future of warfare. We are in the right businesses spanning all domains while earning the highest margins in the industry with further upside potential. Looking forward, we remain committed to meeting the expectations of our customers and creating additional value for shareholders and our second quarter reflects progress towards achieving these commitments. We reported strong financial results for the second quarter, highlighted by segment operating margin of 15.6%, up 80 basis points versus the prior year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.24 up 9%. These results underscore our focus on execution and driving profitable growth. On the demand side, our pipeline of domestic and international opportunities remains robust, and our total backlog stands at $32 billion. In our communication system segment, we ended the quarter with record backlog of over $6 billion from increasing demand for our resilient communication products. This is driven by DOD and international customers needs for seamless, resilient communications across multiple domains as they face increasingly sophisticated near peer threats. We continue to work with these customers to help them avoid the inherent vulnerability that comes from relying upon commercial communication and satellite network providers for their critical missions. Our tactical communications business continues to see growing international demand for European and NATO allies, totaling more than $1 billion in the near term opportunities, and a continued robust pipeline of greater than $10 billion. Overall, we are continuing to see plenty of opportunity for resilient communications, propulsion, and ISR to highlight a few of our capabilities. We continue to make strides in our operational performance, which is reflected in our expanded margins. Programmatically, we're beginning to realize that benefits of our maturing risk management processes and disciplined bid rigor, as well as the initial benefits of our LHX NeXt Program, and that is showing up in our program results. Our first half performance provides confidence for the remainder of the year, leading us to increase our guidance, which Ken will discuss in more detail. I'm pleased with the progress we're making on our LHX NeXt initiative. In the second quarter, our efforts focused on workforce and infrastructure optimization, including the strategic collaboration for managed services, designed to accelerate the modernization and automation of our IT infrastructure, while reducing cost and transforming how we operate as a business. We've made great progress, and we're ahead of schedule. The next phase of LHX NeXt is centered around the supply chain management and leveraging the scale of our enterprise. This will improve cost, quality, and delivery for our customers, while simultaneously offering our suppliers demand stability and an opportunity to grow along with us. And for us, it means supply chain management will be a competitive discriminator. Turning to capital deployment, as promised we are prioritizing debt pay down, continuing to maintain a competitive dividend, and returning excess capital to shareholders. In the quarter, we returned over $300 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and remain on track to meet our stated 2024 target of approximately $500 million in share repurchases, holding outstanding shares flat year-over-year. Aligned with our national security focus, we recently completed the sale of our antennas business, and expect to finalize the pending divestiture of our commercial aviation business later this year, as we satisfy the remaining conditions to close. And finally, I want to thank the four Board Members who served on our Ad Hoc business review committee. Their recommendations were presented to the Board last week, and we are implementing actions in accordance with those recommendations. The focus was on reviewing our strategy and portfolio, program management, disciplined bidding processes, and LHX NeXt plans. The Business Review Committee executed as per its charter, and as such is now dissolved. As recommendations are appreciated, and as I noted, are being executed in a rapid manner to continue to drive value for shareholders and customers. I'll now turn it over to Ken to provide insight on our second quarter results and 2024 guidance.\nKenneth L. Bedingfield: Thanks, Chris. I'll start with consolidated results for the quarter. Demand remains high, and in the second quarter we were awarded over $5 billion in new awards, resulting in a book-to-bill of $1.0, and total backlog of $32 billion. We were awarded a nearly $900 million contract for the delivery of electronic time fuses, which play a crucial role in replenishing our nation's critical ammunitions inventory. We were also awarded a $1 billion IDIQ contract with an initial task order of $123 million to supply the next lot of multi-functional information distribution systems, jitters terminals to the U.S. Navy, leveraging the unique capabilities of the TDL product line that we acquired last year. Consolidated revenue grew 13% or 1% organically. Operating margins continued to be strong, expanding to 15.6%, up 80 basis points, reflecting improved operational and program performance across all segments with LHX NeXt cost savings contributing. Chris highlighted our EPS growth of 9% as a result of strong operational performance. I'd like to add that on a pension-adjusted basis, second quarter EPS was up 13% as profitable growth drops to the bottom line. Free cash flow was 714 million for the second quarter driven by increased operating income and improved working capital performance. In the quarter, we repaid a $350 million note which helped reduce our net leverage to 3.2 times down from 3.5 times in the previous quarter. By segment, organic growth within our communication system segment was over 4% from higher production rates and deliveries of resilient communication products. Space and airborne systems segment revenue was flat with growth in space systems and classified programs offset by lower volumes in our airborne combat systems business as we focus on negotiating appropriate business terms. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was also flat as higher volumes on maritime programs were offset by lower volume in our commercial aviation business. Aerojet Rocketdyne contributed almost 600 million of revenue for the second quarter. Turning to margins, CS reported margins of 24.4%, down slightly over year, reflecting the timing of software sales and higher DOD revenue mix, which is first half-weighted as we've previously discussed. This was partially offset by LHX NeXt cost savings and the favorable net one-time impact of legal settlements. We continue to expect higher international mix and margin opportunity in the second half. In SAS, margin expanded 280 basis points to 12.6% as we continue to see progress on development programs maturing to production and realize the benefits of our LHX NeXt initiatives. IMS continues to make progress on program performance and LHX NeXt resulting in a margin of 11.9%, a 260 basis point increase versus the prior year. Consistent with a plan to rationalize our footprint outlined at Investor Day, we completed the consolidation of three facilities in this segment in the second quarter. Aerojet Rocketdyne reported margins of 12.9%, which included $22 million of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments. With the acquisition now one year behind us, we are wrapping up the purchase accounting period. With respect to the purchase accounting fair value adjustments for loss provisions and off-market contracts, I'll point out these reflect adjustments to baseline contract performance as of the date of acquisition and are not impacted by our subsequent operational improvements, which we expect to see continuing improvement from in our future margin profile. Simply, the adjustments reflect a more informed assessment of the state of legacy contracts as of the date of acquisition close. Finally, turning to guidance. Given our strong first half performance, we are increasing guidance for revenue, margin rate, and EPS, which we've outlined in our earnings release and presentation. We now expect EPS in the range of $12.85 per share to $13.15 per share, and we are reiterating free cash flow guidance of $2.2 billion. The increased guide for revenue, margin, and EPS incorporates solid growth and operational performance in the first half of the year, and a few more months of additional revenue from our commercial aviation business with the pending divestiture now expected to close in the second half. We're pleased with our performance through the first half of the year, highlighted by a year-to-date book-to-bill of 1.03, organic revenue growth of 3%, and sequentially increasing segment operating margin and sequentially increasing segment operating margin and we remain confident in delivering on our commitments to customers and shareholders. Rob, lets open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.\nPeter Arment: Yes, good morning Chris, Ken and Dan, nice results. Ken, maybe just ask on Aerojet, the margin performance in the first half continues to be really strong, but then you compare it to where the guide is for high 11% kind of implies margin step down. Maybe if you could just walk through that or just the thinking there, is it just conservative, or are there other things that maybe you just mentioned that we should understand? Thanks.\nChristopher E. Kubasik: Sure, Peter. I appreciate the question. With respect to Aerojet, I would say, look, the business is performing well halfway through the year. We're happy about the margin performance. There's certainly some aspects of mix in terms of which programs are seeing the volumes at which point through the year as well as we performed in the first half, we were able to see some positive program performance that we've got to go do again in the second half of the year. So we feel good about how Aerojet Rocketdyne is performing. And it's been about a year since we've integrated this business, and we're continuing to learn more. I think you saw that the purchase accounting period ended as well. So we've got that kind of information behind us better informed with the improvements that we're making and how we're driving operational improvements in the business. And we'll work to continue to deliver on that in the second half and see if we can replicate what we did in the first half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nSeth Seifman: Hey, thanks very much and good morning. Wanted to ask, I guess, Ken and maybe, Chris, as well, when you gave the outlook and the targets at Investor Day it was, I think, about 100 basis points of margin improvement in each business. Now that we've seen starting off pretty well here through the first half of 2024, as you look out, if there are any refinements you might make in terms of how you see getting to that 16% margin and the contributions from the various businesses given how they performed so far and what you've been able to get out of the Aerojet\u2019s next program?\nKenneth L. Bedingfield: Yes. Thanks, Seth. I appreciate it. I would say, as we look back at Investor Day and the midterm financial framework that we set out, growing to $23 billion in revenue in 2026, 16% margins and $2.8 billion of free cash flow in that period. I think where we are today gives us more confidence in delivering to that framework. And if you think about the businesses, they have been performing well. I think we've got the programs performing the work we're doing around, program excellence is paying off. I think that if you look at our guide across the segments where we've picked up SAS margin a bit, same with IMS and CS as well. So -- and then if you look at the business, first half of the year, we're at 15.3% growing from, I think it was 14.8% last year. We're making solid progress towards that 16%. I would say that we feel better about it. And we are trying to reflect that in the guidance updates that we're making again, pickups across three segments. And then picking up margin from where we were kicking off 2024 at about 15% to pick it up to a range of 15.2% to 15.4%. So really making good progress towards that framework. I think we're building confidence quarter-by-quarter. And as we progress through the year and then get into 2025, we'll try to provide better clarity around our progress on that. And again, building confidence and maybe it's something that we'll see some acceleration on.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much, good morning.\nChristopher E. Kubasik: Good morning Rob.\nRobert Stallard: Chris, you highlighted that your margins are some of the best in the defense industry, but at least based on the second quarter numbers, your bookings and your revenue growth are a bit behind some of your peers. I was wondering if that reflects this discipline you've had with regard to bidding terms and contracts in that or is it just -- this is not a fair comparison just for this quarter?\nChristopher E. Kubasik: Yes, Rob, it's tough to look at one quarter for a bookings or book-to-bill ratio for year-to-date. We're feeling pretty good as to what we've been able to book, had a great first quarter. So one quarter doesn't make a year. I think our portfolio is well positioned, and we're continuing to be disciplined in what we bid. And I think you're seeing that in the results, especially on the margin front. Some of the prior strategic decisions we made to invest and go after prime positions with SDA for satellites, maybe changing our waveform strategy, what we're doing with counter UAS with VAMPIRE winning billable [ph] watch. All those programs are starting to pay off. And as Ken mentioned, we've really upped our program management and execution with training new tools, hiring experienced hires externally where appropriate. And we talk about bidding discipline. Just making sure we have the right contract type. I think we were one of the first to come out and say, we are not going to bid fixed-price development programs with options at the proposal process. And we're doing a lot better, getting the cost basis and asking for a reasonable fee. So we're taking our time, and we're negotiating. And I would expect the third quarter, we'll see a bump relative to the book-to-bill.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nRonald Epstein: Hey, good morning guys. Chris, maybe just a big picture question. We just had the NATO Summit and the Royal International Air Tattoo about a week ago, Farnborough, it really does seem like spending in Europe is on the rise. We've seen that reflected in some of the defense equities in Europe. What opportunity does that create for L3Harris and maybe new markets or things that the European industrial base just can't do themselves. Can you talk about that a bit?\nChristopher E. Kubasik: Absolutely. I actually was in attendance at the defense summit as part of the NATO Summit in D.C. with the various Ministers of Defense and international customer leadership. And it was a different tone than in the past. And I think you're hitting on an excellent point. I think most U.S. companies don't view Europe as a growth market or even much of a market because of the indigenous capabilities that exist. But the theme at the NATO Summit was all about interoperability and the need for these countries to either bundle acquisitions or have their products work and with the conflict in Ukraine I think everybody sees the benefit of the interoperability, not only amongst the 32 member countries, which includes the U.S., but given the threat profile in Europe. So in our case, we look at our software-defined radios as a perfect example. I think we're uniquely positioned there and there was a lot of interest in that. And back at the envelope, we think this could be 100,000 radio opportunity in the years ahead. So Europe is one of our larger markets that we're now going after for all the reasons you mentioned, Ron. And I think that's a nice upside for 2024 and it should give us some tailwind in the years ahead.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nKristine Liwag: Hey, good morning Chris, Ken and Dan. So maybe wrapping up on the Ad Hoc business review committee, you mentioned that it completed its review. So can you provide any color to the extended recommendations it made and some of the findings. What is now the implementation plan and how is this different from the multiyear outlook you've given at the Investor Day?\nChristopher E. Kubasik: Yes. Thanks for that question, Kristine. I'll just say I thought it was a good review. We all learned from the process, and I'd say all parties, both the members of the Ad Hoc business review committee and management benefited from the discussion and it has no change on our 2026 financial framework. And the ideas, suggestions, and discussions were beneficial, and we're already implementing some recommendations, and we'll continue to do so throughout the year.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. I was hoping to maybe if you could, Chris, drill into the Communication Systems order trends and backlog as you see it sitting here today in the first six months and also from an international perspective, I think it was about flattish growth in the first half and DoD was more driving it and you're expecting, I think, that to shift in the second half. I'm just curious if the order trends are starting to accelerate on that front?\nChristopher E. Kubasik: Yes. Thanks, Myles. As I said, we have about $32 billion in backlog way up from when the company was formed five years ago. I guess I really see three major areas. The DoD modernization we've been talking about for quite some time. And if you go back, there was a basis of issue, what we call BOI to buy 480,000 radios from us and our competitors. To date, we've delivered 180,000. So there's still a 300,000 radio opportunity. And clearly, as these IDIQs have annual task orders we've been rather successful in winning our fair share or more than our fair share. And I expect that to continue. During the pandemic, we actually invested in capacity up in Rochester. We've come up with some new techniques. We have what we call our Smart cell, which is a different way of integrating radios. We've seen our yields improve. We're using a smaller footprint and it's really changing the way that we integrate our radios. We continue to invest in software. We have some new wave forms and I think it's important to remember, these are software-defined radios. So the hardware probably has a 10 to 15-year life. So there'll be a replenishment of that. But more importantly, there's a continuous demand for the software and the upgrade. So the DoD modernization as far as we can see, continues to look good, the budgets will come out and they'll adjust the quantities based on that, but there's clear demand here in the U.S. I mentioned the NATO in an earlier question, again, we see a huge opportunity for NATO with that focus on interoperability, and we continue to have success around the globe with our software-defined radios and the whole focus on resilient comms. I think that's one of the lessons learned. There was a big difference between just being able to communicate and communicate in a resilient, protected fashion in our networks are coming out as world-class in that regard. And I've alluded to our software and waveforms. We're continuing to see demand for our resilient wave forms. And this is one of two markets, it is either an upsell for a new software-defined radio or it's a licensing opportunity for the installed base. So just on CS, we have about a $16 billion pipeline looking out three years. As I mentioned, $10 billion international, the rest domestic. So we feel real good about the business and the growth potential and just to close off, we don't see any supply chain issues or constraints as we have in the prior years, which gives us even further confidence in the outlook.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks, good morning everyone. I wanted to see Chris, Ken, if you could maybe dig in to IMS margins a little bit. We've seen nice improvement here in the first half, but it looks like you're forecasting kind of flat to maybe down a little bit sequentially off Q2 in the second half. From what I remember from the Investor Day, the commentary was around that you would move through some of these fixed-price development programs in the second half of the year and if anything we would start to see the margin improvement in the second half of the year, so if you could just maybe address IMS margins? Thanks.\nKenneth L. Bedingfield: Sure. Thanks, David. Appreciate it. From an IMS perspective, I would say a couple of things. One, we're really happy to see the performance that IMS has had in the first half of the year. I think the programs are performing well, and that's delivering solid margins for us and significant growth over the first half of 2023. In terms of the margin profile between first half and second half, a couple of things. One, we did have some favorable commercial mix in the first half in terms of electro optical, more kind of commercial type of business within IMS. And then we are starting to see the benefits of LHX NeXt cost savings, those should endure as well. But from a first half, second half perspective, I think it's two things. One, just the mix commercial. We are going to see growth in IMS in the second half. We talked a little bit about the first half within IMS, having a little bit of growth headwinds with respect to ISR and some aircraft procurements in the first half of 2023. As that abates we may see some mix that moves a little bit more towards ISR, some of the businesses that aren't as highly profitable as some of the commercial businesses in there. But the fact of the matter is we've got to perform in the second half. I think our guide is solid. At IMS, we picked it up to low to mid 11%. We're sitting at 11.7% year-to-date. So I think building confidence in our IMS team and their ability to perform and biggest impact would be the mix as we look at the second half.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. Good morning Chris and Ken. So maybe if we could talk about SAS on the top line and bottom line, what trends are you seeing in terms of ongoing growth in Space and Intel with the offset in airborne combat systems? And how do you think about the timing of airborne stabilizing and any context you could give us on the return hurdles you're deploying to have this disciplined profit fall through?\nChristopher E. Kubasik: Alright, Sheila, let me start and then maybe I'll have Ken chime in. Starting with space, again, I think that is the example. We keep holding up of what the benefit of the merger was in our trusted disruptor strategy. As I've said before, we're the only company to have been awarded Tranche 1 and 2 for the tracking layer and the RFI for Tranche 3 just came out. So the timing appears to be a little slower than we would have liked, but we're confident in our ability to continue with the SDA. On the transport layer, we've taken the strategy of being a merchant supplier. So we'll have content on the transport layer as well when that is awarded and the classified continues to be a strength. So space and intel and cyber are the growth markets, those are core competencies for us, and that's where the customer demand is. We also have in there our Mission Network FAA work, which is pretty stable, low single-digit growth. And then again, as you mentioned, the airborne continues to have headwinds as a lot of these missions are moving from air to space. And we continue to have great capabilities on mission systems. So to the extent [indiscernible] is awarded, we have opportunities there, CCA, we have opportunities there. And in the interim, we continue to support F-35, F-16, F-18 and the such. So I think it's a story of space and intel growing and airborne continuing to be flat to down based on our customers' strategies and acquisition approaches. Ken?\nKenneth L. Bedingfield: Yes, Sheila, from a margin perspective, I would say as we look at SAS, I think the biggest contributor to margin performance in the first half really has been the implementation of the LHX NeXt program. I think the team there has really embraced the program worked really hard to get their cost structure where it needs to be and think about kind of how we deliver capability as we look forward. Secondly, I would say we did take on, and Chris mentioned a great example of it, which is SDA where we took on some challenging development work. It was a near adjacency moving out of high-resolution weather imagery into missile defense with similar sensors. And as we work through those development programs in 2023 and now we are moving into the production phase, so off of Tranche 0 into Tranche 1, increasing quantities and then starting to see some volume as we move into Tranche 2, I think it's a business model that's really starting to pay off for SAS. So feel good about not just the margin profile but I think importantly, some of the bets that we made, really starting to pay dividends in terms of our ability to perform and I think identifying the right bets to make with our limited resources. So feel good about SAS and in particular, I think, very strategic areas of growth in particular space and the Intel and Cyber business, much of which is classified, but real solid opportunity there, and we see, I think, a solid growing and performing business.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe Chris or Ken, just back to Peter's first question on Aerojet. It looks like second half of the year, the guidance implies, I think, maybe a 14% to 18% growth second half over first half. Ken, can you maybe talk about what the drivers are, is that more of the short-cycle volumes, I know you said you were really catching up on the past dues and then if you could just give us what the Aerojet book-to-bill was in the quarter?\nChristopher E. Kubasik: Yes. Let me Michael, give a little bit of an overview on Aerojet because it's been a year since we closed and 18 months since we announced the deal. So I like to look at this acquisition, as I said, 18 months ago, strategically, operationally and financially. So I'll give some highlights for the first two and then ask Ken to comment on your specific question. I will tell you, we're not going to disclose book-to-bill by segment at this time. So I appreciate the question, but you're not going to get an answer to that one. But strategically, I think as I've said before, and I'd say, again, I feel much better about this acquisition today than I did 12 months or 18 months ago. And it's clear that the demand is well in excess of the supply and you see that by lots of companies wanting to spend hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to enter this new market. So we are well, well positioned. And I think when I look at our portfolio, this is one of the faster-growing opportunities for L3Harris. Operationally, there were some serious challenges that we've talked about. We've upgraded the talent pretty much across the board. We've doubled our on-time deliveries in 12 months, and we literally have thousands of overdue deliveries that we've cut by 40% in 12 months, our project will be 60% reduced by the end of the year. So we have red yellow green programs. We're getting more and more green programs each quarter. The customer relation is great. The technology is a discriminator. I can go on that longer if someone wants to know, but we have two pulse solid rocket motors. We have liquid and solid divert attitude control systems, Hypersonics is a huge opportunity over the long term. And we're continuing to invest. We're breaking ground in Virginia next week on a new building. We've opened a couple in Camden. We have our hovens [ph] in arriving later this month. We have new mixers coming in by the end of the year. So everything is paying off. We're investing our own money. We're using DoD DPA money, we're using prime co-investment money and it's a great market, and we love working for our primes and supporting them in their ultimate missile deliveries. So I just thought I wanted to give that context as to how much progress we've made in 12 months. Ken, do you want to answer the financial questions?\nKenneth L. Bedingfield: Sure. Yes. In terms of the profile, Michael, I would say we've very clearly been focused, and we talked about this on previous calls, I believe, really focused on integrating Aerojet into L3Harris. We've overdelivered, I think, on the integration savings and now the team is really focused on the long-term health of the business, the operational improvements that Chris talked about. And we're really not trying to drive the business for any particular quarter results. I will mention, Aerojet is primarily on the cost-to-cost percentage of completion, basis. And as we look at the second half, we've seen as we're working with the supply chain that we should start to see some deliveries from our suppliers accelerate, which will drive some of the growth in the second half. And as we continue to see that business grow, I think that profile will continue to build for us, not just in the second half of 2024, but into 2025. So I think the business is being positioned very well. And as that work has been done and a great job by the Aerojet team in doing that, I think it really enables us to start to focus on to Chris' point, delivering product, working with the supply base, working on the facilitization, the equipment, the improvements that we're making and using that kind of as a baseline to start to drive the growth and the opportunities that we see in Aerojet. So I feel really good about that. But I would say the biggest thing is just really working with the suppliers and getting the product in the door so that we can get the critical capabilities out to our customers.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Scott Deuschle with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.\nScott Deuschle: Hey, good morning. Chris, I appreciate the earlier comment on not disclosing book-to-bill by segment, but I always found that disclosure to be pretty helpful when I'm trying to do analysis around what future growth would look like. So I guess is that disclosure something you contemplate bringing back at some point or do you just view it as not being relevant anymore? Thank you.\nKenneth L. Bedingfield: Yes, Scott, it's Ken here. I would say from a growth perspective we're providing guidance for the year by segment. I think we've -- in the Investor Day, given a solid midterm financial framework with our growth of $23 billion in sales. And in terms of kind of how we guide, what we guide, and when we provide information, we're comfortable with the process that we're working through and feel like we've given a good set of transparency with the guidance across each of the segments. And book-to-bill itself can be a little bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter. I think it's more relevant to think about on a long-term basis, and that's why we're really focused on providing that in annual disclosure. So we don't kind of get lost in the weeds on any particular quarter scenario. But in terms of the question around book-to-bill at Aerojet, I think we've seen an order or two sliding from the first half into the second half but we're still planning to see a real solid book-to-bill for Aerojet for full year 2024.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jason Gursky with Citigroup. Please proceed with your questions.\nJason Gursky: Great, thanks. One quick clarification question for you, Chris, and then I've got one for Ken. On the clarification, Chris, you mentioned that an RFI or maybe you said RFP, I'm not here on Tranche 3 just hit. Just kind of curious what the volume is going to look like on that compared to Tranche 2, whether it's flat, growing or shrinking? And then, Ken, for you, I was just curious to know whether the success that you're having with the cost take outs end up being a little bit temporal on the margin side of things, meaning that over time, you give some of that back. And I was wondering if you can just kind of help us kind of think through whether these margins expansion that you've seen here is just structurally higher or if we're sticking to the longer-term guidance because you're going to end up giving some of this back, the cost savings that is and I suspect this has an impact on revenue as well, particularly on your cost plus contracts, if there's any way you can kind of quantify the impacts of NeXt on margins temporarily and then what it does to your revenue growth, if anything? Thanks.\nChristopher E. Kubasik: Sure. So two-part question. Let me address the what I think was SDA Tranche 3 question first. And there, I think, is an RFI that hit the street, and we certainly don't want to get ahead of our customer in terms of what that looks like. But we are excited to be the only company that's been successful on Tranches is 0, 1 and 2. We will be analyzing that RFI and providing responses and certainly bidding as that RFP comes out. And it looks like maybe what was potentially a late 2024 might not be a 2025 acquisition from the government for that particular one. And from a quantity perspective, I don't have that precise number in front of me, but I think it's either similar to Tranche 2 or I believe the overall quantity is similar to Tranche 2, I guess the ultimate question is, do they continue with 3 providers or move to 2 type of things. So we'll continue to work through that, but feeling really good about it, and I think we're making good progress on that program. In terms of the second part of the question on LHX margin profile, yes, absolutely we are driving the LHX NeXt program for a couple of reasons, one of which is to enable us to deliver margin opportunity, but also to drive value for our customers as well. And that's not just from a cost perspective but also includes schedule as the trusted disruptor, the ability to listen to our customers, and respond quickly and provide capability at pace. But in terms of the specifics with respect to the cost savings, we have estimated roughly that about 40% of the savings will accrue to the company in terms of additional margin opportunities. So against the $1 billion of savings, we talked about essentially $400 million of opportunity from a margin perspective. And we'll certainly work hard to continue to drive up both the amount of the savings, as I think we're executing well on LHX NeXt and moving towards and gaining confidence towards our $1 billion target. So we'll work to make sure we get at least that amount. And then obviously, working to see if we can maintain as much of that as opportunity for margin improvement benefit at the company as well. You may remember at the time of the merger, we did realize I think, something between 50% and 60% of the integration savings. LHX NeXt is a little bit more of an enduring kind of three-year program versus the quicker integration. And because of that, we're projecting that a little bit more of it will accrue back to the government, which is a good thing. It enables us to be more competitive, win more new business as we look forward. But we'll certainly be working to see if we can find ways to realize margin improvements. And it may not be direct improvements out of the program, but as we return cost savings to the programs, and they can think about how they perform better and are able to turn that into future profitability that we can bank down the road for future program performance, we'll certainly think about that as well. So I think the -- at the end of the day, the story is LHX NeXt, we are performing very well. I think we're ahead of schedule. I think we're building confidence, got more confidence today than we did just a quarter ago, and we will certainly work to drive as much of that into margin opportunity as we can. So thanks, Jason.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Richard Safran, Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your questions.\nRichard Safran: Chris, Ken, Dan, good morning. I dropped off for some reason so if you've answered this, I'll ask something else to ask you. I thought you had some pretty solid free cash flow in 2Q beating expectations. You took up your operational guide but you maintained your $2.2 billion free cash flow guide for the year. Just wondering if you're expecting some working capital headwinds in the second half or maybe baking in some conservatism due to some risk with collections in the second half, so I thought maybe you'd elaborate on that a little more?\nChristopher E. Kubasik: Sure, Rich and I appreciate the question and it hasn't been asked previously so we're good on that front. In terms of free cash flow guide, we're at $2.2 billion for the year. And as I think about halfway through the year, we're roughly 25% to our full year guidance. It's certainly not a profile that we are uncomfortable with. It's kind of about where we are normally this far through the year. We've got a fair amount of cash to generate in the second half, but we're comfortable, absolutely reiterating the guidance at $2.2 billion. And I don't think we're expecting any working capital build necessarily in the second half, but we've got to work with our customers, get the payments coming in the door, work with our suppliers, making sure we're paying the term on those fronts. And the way I would characterize it, similar to Jason's question on LHX NeXt is we're building confidence to our guide and maybe as importantly, we're sticking with our guidance in the 2026 financial framework of $2.2 billion in 2024, $2.4 billion in 2025, and $2.8 billion in 2026. And that's kind of the bigger picture that we're thinking about is how we continue to build confidence into that increasing free cash flow as we grow the business. And quite frankly, as we get the net leverage targets where we need to be, hopefully, by the end of 2024, and we start to deploy capital with more -- a little more of a tilt towards share repurchase, really driving our ability to see some free cash flow per share growth as we look out into 2025 and 2026. So feeling really good about it. I think it's a great profile, and I think it's a really solid part of our story with that midterm financial framework. And again, I think we're just building confidence towards that, and I feel really good about it. So thanks for the question, Rich.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your questions.\nPeter Skibitski: Yeah thanks, good morning guys. Hey Chris, going back years to L3, you guys had done a number of niche acquisitions in the unmanned space, especially unmanned maritime. And I believe all those units came over to L3Harris, but we haven't really heard about the focus on unmanned at L3. I'm just wondering, is that still an interesting area for you, I know that DoD is kind of still experimenting, trying to figure things out but is there anything chunky out there contract-wise that you're looking towards or still early days, just want to get your updated thoughts on that whole area?\nChristopher E. Kubasik: Yes, Peter, great question. The whole undersea and autonomy markets are growth markets for us. I would say on the undersea, what we're seeing more is on the sea beds, the sensors, a lot of classified work, which are not the autonomous ones. We refer to those as grotto and there's a big opportunity coming up almost $1 billion where we're competing. This would be the third opportunity, we won two already. So that could be a real growth engine for maritime. Relative to the autonomy, we still are doing well on the autonomous surface vehicles. I think the Navy is still developing its autonomous strategy and relative to the unmanned undersea, these are relatively inexpensive products. So we continue to invest. We've had great success with our Torpedo launch and recovery using an unmanned undersea vehicle, which is kind of a game changer. But we can highlight it more, but these are literally -- you sell 20, 30, 40 of these. It just doesn't add up to a lot of money, but it's critical to the mission and we should be able to start seeing some export opportunities here in the years ahead. So still part of the portfolio, it is still doing well. Just the price of the products are relatively inexpensive and probably don't roll up to the materiality to talk about them, but we'll try to do more in the future.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nKenneth Herbert: Hey, good morning Chris and Ken. Maybe I wanted to ask Chris on the CS segment, it sounds like there's going to be a nice mix shift for international in the second half. And you called out some pretty substantial opportunities as we think about tactical radios and other aspects of that market. But maybe can you just talk about the competitive landscape and to what extent you're seeing incremental price pressure there on the tactical communications side, in particular, and how you might be thinking about the opportunity to maybe take share, especially in international markets?\nChristopher E. Kubasik: Yes, Ken. Good to hear from you. Domestically, they tend to split the buys, as we've talked about before, 60-40, 70-30 and such, and we're usually the winner of the majority share. But internationally, it is a winner-take-all environment. And generally, we've had great success. And again, these are relatively inexpensive compared to other weapon systems or products out there. So the price is not really that much of a differentiator and pricing strategy, we have a price target. We have -- we know what the costs are and as you know, we get reasonably good margins in this business. So we don't plan on lowering the prices and the customers see the benefit of our technology and again, the interoperability. So we try to cut a fair business deal. But I feel real good about what we're doing. And we've been able to take cost out through our LHX NeXt initiatives. We're getting dual source suppliers. So we don't have single points of failures across the company, but especially in CF and feel real good about this portfolio and the market opportunities. So I think we're going to be in good shape. I'm not going to mention any specific countries, but there's a lot of big opportunities here in Europe that are going through the FMS process and we should have a good second half of the year.\nDaniel Gittsovich: Rob, let\u2019s take our last question.\nOperator: So the last question will be from Gavin Parsons with UBS.\nGavin Parsons: Thanks, good morning.\nChristopher E. Kubasik: Good morning.\nGavin Parsons: Guys, I just wanted to go back to the supplemental if you could give a little additional color. I think you'd said maybe there was going to be some additional radio revenue in there. Is that upside potential through the end of the year or into next year, is that more of a derisking factor for the guide?\nChristopher E. Kubasik: Yes. It's built into the guide. And again, it's always hard to predict the actual quantity and timing and the congressional approval process. But a lot of that money for a variety of countries flows our way, either directly in the radios, a little bit on night vision goggles, and then indirectly through the solid rocket motors supporting the primes for the ammunitions. So I think that gives us confidence and stability in our guide. And as you suggest, some of this should roll into 2025 as we make the deliveries in the next 12 to 18 months. So with that, before we sign off, I always like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication. We believe we're truly changing the industry, and I'm proud of what they've accomplished and we've accomplished in the last five years. We're very optimistic about the future, and we look forward to talking to everybody in the months ahead. So thanks for joining the call today. Have a good weekend.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Kenneth L. Bedingfield",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. I'll start with consolidated results for the quarter. Demand remains high, and in the second quarter we were awarded over $5 billion in new awards, resulting in a book-to-bill of $1.0, and total backlog of $32 billion. We were awarded a nearly $900 million contract for the delivery of electronic time fuses, which play a crucial role in replenishing our nation's critical ammunitions inventory. We were also awarded a $1 billion IDIQ contract with an initial task order of $123 million to supply the next lot of multi-functional information distribution systems, jitters terminals to the U.S. Navy, leveraging the unique capabilities of the TDL product line that we acquired last year. Consolidated revenue grew 13% or 1% organically. Operating margins continued to be strong, expanding to 15.6%, up 80 basis points, reflecting improved operational and program performance across all segments with LHX NeXt cost savings contributing. Chris highlighted our EPS growth of 9% as a result of strong operational performance. I'd like to add that on a pension-adjusted basis, second quarter EPS was up 13% as profitable growth drops to the bottom line. Free cash flow was 714 million for the second quarter driven by increased operating income and improved working capital performance. In the quarter, we repaid a $350 million note which helped reduce our net leverage to 3.2 times down from 3.5 times in the previous quarter. By segment, organic growth within our communication system segment was over 4% from higher production rates and deliveries of resilient communication products. Space and airborne systems segment revenue was flat with growth in space systems and classified programs offset by lower volumes in our airborne combat systems business as we focus on negotiating appropriate business terms. Integrated Mission Systems revenue was also flat as higher volumes on maritime programs were offset by lower volume in our commercial aviation business. Aerojet Rocketdyne contributed almost 600 million of revenue for the second quarter. Turning to margins, CS reported margins of 24.4%, down slightly over year, reflecting the timing of software sales and higher DOD revenue mix, which is first half-weighted as we've previously discussed. This was partially offset by LHX NeXt cost savings and the favorable net one-time impact of legal settlements. We continue to expect higher international mix and margin opportunity in the second half. In SAS, margin expanded 280 basis points to 12.6% as we continue to see progress on development programs maturing to production and realize the benefits of our LHX NeXt initiatives. IMS continues to make progress on program performance and LHX NeXt resulting in a margin of 11.9%, a 260 basis point increase versus the prior year. Consistent with a plan to rationalize our footprint outlined at Investor Day, we completed the consolidation of three facilities in this segment in the second quarter. Aerojet Rocketdyne reported margins of 12.9%, which included $22 million of amortization of purchase accounting adjustments. With the acquisition now one year behind us, we are wrapping up the purchase accounting period. With respect to the purchase accounting fair value adjustments for loss provisions and off-market contracts, I'll point out these reflect adjustments to baseline contract performance as of the date of acquisition and are not impacted by our subsequent operational improvements, which we expect to see continuing improvement from in our future margin profile. Simply, the adjustments reflect a more informed assessment of the state of legacy contracts as of the date of acquisition close. Finally, turning to guidance. Given our strong first half performance, we are increasing guidance for revenue, margin rate, and EPS, which we've outlined in our earnings release and presentation. We now expect EPS in the range of $12.85 per share to $13.15 per share, and we are reiterating free cash flow guidance of $2.2 billion. The increased guide for revenue, margin, and EPS incorporates solid growth and operational performance in the first half of the year, and a few more months of additional revenue from our commercial aviation business with the pending divestiture now expected to close in the second half. We're pleased with our performance through the first half of the year, highlighted by a year-to-date book-to-bill of 1.03, organic revenue growth of 3%, and sequentially increasing segment operating margin and sequentially increasing segment operating margin and we remain confident in delivering on our commitments to customers and shareholders. Rob, lets open the line for questions. Yes. Thanks, Seth. I appreciate it. I would say, as we look back at Investor Day and the midterm financial framework that we set out, growing to $23 billion in revenue in 2026, 16% margins and $2.8 billion of free cash flow in that period. I think where we are today gives us more confidence in delivering to that framework. And if you think about the businesses, they have been performing well. I think we've got the programs performing the work we're doing around, program excellence is paying off. I think that if you look at our guide across the segments where we've picked up SAS margin a bit, same with IMS and CS as well. So -- and then if you look at the business, first half of the year, we're at 15.3% growing from, I think it was 14.8% last year. We're making solid progress towards that 16%. I would say that we feel better about it. And we are trying to reflect that in the guidance updates that we're making again, pickups across three segments. And then picking up margin from where we were kicking off 2024 at about 15% to pick it up to a range of 15.2% to 15.4%. So really making good progress towards that framework. I think we're building confidence quarter-by-quarter. And as we progress through the year and then get into 2025, we'll try to provide better clarity around our progress on that. And again, building confidence and maybe it's something that we'll see some acceleration on. Sure. Thanks, David. Appreciate it. From an IMS perspective, I would say a couple of things. One, we're really happy to see the performance that IMS has had in the first half of the year. I think the programs are performing well, and that's delivering solid margins for us and significant growth over the first half of 2023. In terms of the margin profile between first half and second half, a couple of things. One, we did have some favorable commercial mix in the first half in terms of electro optical, more kind of commercial type of business within IMS. And then we are starting to see the benefits of LHX NeXt cost savings, those should endure as well. But from a first half, second half perspective, I think it's two things. One, just the mix commercial. We are going to see growth in IMS in the second half. We talked a little bit about the first half within IMS, having a little bit of growth headwinds with respect to ISR and some aircraft procurements in the first half of 2023. As that abates we may see some mix that moves a little bit more towards ISR, some of the businesses that aren't as highly profitable as some of the commercial businesses in there. But the fact of the matter is we've got to perform in the second half. I think our guide is solid. At IMS, we picked it up to low to mid 11%. We're sitting at 11.7% year-to-date. So I think building confidence in our IMS team and their ability to perform and biggest impact would be the mix as we look at the second half. Yes, Sheila, from a margin perspective, I would say as we look at SAS, I think the biggest contributor to margin performance in the first half really has been the implementation of the LHX NeXt program. I think the team there has really embraced the program worked really hard to get their cost structure where it needs to be and think about kind of how we deliver capability as we look forward. Secondly, I would say we did take on, and Chris mentioned a great example of it, which is SDA where we took on some challenging development work. It was a near adjacency moving out of high-resolution weather imagery into missile defense with similar sensors. And as we work through those development programs in 2023 and now we are moving into the production phase, so off of Tranche 0 into Tranche 1, increasing quantities and then starting to see some volume as we move into Tranche 2, I think it's a business model that's really starting to pay off for SAS. So feel good about not just the margin profile but I think importantly, some of the bets that we made, really starting to pay dividends in terms of our ability to perform and I think identifying the right bets to make with our limited resources. So feel good about SAS and in particular, I think, very strategic areas of growth in particular space and the Intel and Cyber business, much of which is classified, but real solid opportunity there, and we see, I think, a solid growing and performing business. Sure. Yes. In terms of the profile, Michael, I would say we've very clearly been focused, and we talked about this on previous calls, I believe, really focused on integrating Aerojet into L3Harris. We've overdelivered, I think, on the integration savings and now the team is really focused on the long-term health of the business, the operational improvements that Chris talked about. And we're really not trying to drive the business for any particular quarter results. I will mention, Aerojet is primarily on the cost-to-cost percentage of completion, basis. And as we look at the second half, we've seen as we're working with the supply chain that we should start to see some deliveries from our suppliers accelerate, which will drive some of the growth in the second half. And as we continue to see that business grow, I think that profile will continue to build for us, not just in the second half of 2024, but into 2025. So I think the business is being positioned very well. And as that work has been done and a great job by the Aerojet team in doing that, I think it really enables us to start to focus on to Chris' point, delivering product, working with the supply base, working on the facilitization, the equipment, the improvements that we're making and using that kind of as a baseline to start to drive the growth and the opportunities that we see in Aerojet. So I feel really good about that. But I would say the biggest thing is just really working with the suppliers and getting the product in the door so that we can get the critical capabilities out to our customers. Yes, Scott, it's Ken here. I would say from a growth perspective we're providing guidance for the year by segment. I think we've -- in the Investor Day, given a solid midterm financial framework with our growth of $23 billion in sales. And in terms of kind of how we guide, what we guide, and when we provide information, we're comfortable with the process that we're working through and feel like we've given a good set of transparency with the guidance across each of the segments. And book-to-bill itself can be a little bit lumpy quarter-to-quarter. I think it's more relevant to think about on a long-term basis, and that's why we're really focused on providing that in annual disclosure. So we don't kind of get lost in the weeds on any particular quarter scenario. But in terms of the question around book-to-bill at Aerojet, I think we've seen an order or two sliding from the first half into the second half but we're still planning to see a real solid book-to-bill for Aerojet for full year 2024."

            "name": "Christopher E. Kubasik",
            "content": "Thanks, Dan and welcome to the IR team and your first earnings call with us. Last month marked the five-year anniversary of the transformative merger between L3 and Harris, and the creation of the industry's trusted disruptor, a proven alternative to both traditional primes and new entrants, focused on relentless innovation to deliver capability with the speed, passion, and determination that our customers demand in executing their most challenging missions. Unlike traditional primes and new commercial entrants, we utilize both commercial and government business models with significant presence in each. We deliver commercial short cycle products, such as software-defined radios. We also execute on critical long-term programs that span the entire life cycle from development to production, including international exports, and ultimately sustainment and support. Our diverse and platform agnostic portfolio enables us to work across the ecosystem as a prime, a sub, or a merchant supplier to deliver the best solutions for our customers and the best returns for our shareholders. Further, as the trusted disruptor, we are actively looking for opportunities to partner with small and large companies where it makes business sense. It was one year ago that we announced the successful addition of Aerojet Rocketdyne to the L3Harris portfolio. This acquisition increases our content on missile platforms and positions us for growth in new markets. A recent example is our role on the missile defense agencies' next-generation interceptor program. This leverages our industry-leading propulsion technology and innovative attitude control systems to defend against long-range ballistic missile threats. We are also integrating legacy L3Harris electronics capabilities. Since closing the acquisition, and as we've discussed on our last two earnings calls, we've made substantial progress in improving the operational performance of the business, and we continue to make investments to increase capacity and drive efficiencies to meet our customers growing demand, including the expansion of key facilities in Arkansas, Alabama, and Virginia. As a result of these combined efforts, we have reduced overdue deliveries by nearly 40% in the past 12 months. Several of you had a chance to visit our inert center of excellence in Huntsville, Alabama, and we know you left with a better understanding of the business and the progress to date. Since the merger, we focused on integrating and shaping the portfolio to align with national security priorities and the future of warfare. We are in the right businesses spanning all domains while earning the highest margins in the industry with further upside potential. Looking forward, we remain committed to meeting the expectations of our customers and creating additional value for shareholders and our second quarter reflects progress towards achieving these commitments. We reported strong financial results for the second quarter, highlighted by segment operating margin of 15.6%, up 80 basis points versus the prior year, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.24 up 9%. These results underscore our focus on execution and driving profitable growth. On the demand side, our pipeline of domestic and international opportunities remains robust, and our total backlog stands at $32 billion. In our communication system segment, we ended the quarter with record backlog of over $6 billion from increasing demand for our resilient communication products. This is driven by DOD and international customers needs for seamless, resilient communications across multiple domains as they face increasingly sophisticated near peer threats. We continue to work with these customers to help them avoid the inherent vulnerability that comes from relying upon commercial communication and satellite network providers for their critical missions. Our tactical communications business continues to see growing international demand for European and NATO allies, totaling more than $1 billion in the near term opportunities, and a continued robust pipeline of greater than $10 billion. Overall, we are continuing to see plenty of opportunity for resilient communications, propulsion, and ISR to highlight a few of our capabilities. We continue to make strides in our operational performance, which is reflected in our expanded margins. Programmatically, we're beginning to realize that benefits of our maturing risk management processes and disciplined bid rigor, as well as the initial benefits of our LHX NeXt Program, and that is showing up in our program results. Our first half performance provides confidence for the remainder of the year, leading us to increase our guidance, which Ken will discuss in more detail. I'm pleased with the progress we're making on our LHX NeXt initiative. In the second quarter, our efforts focused on workforce and infrastructure optimization, including the strategic collaboration for managed services, designed to accelerate the modernization and automation of our IT infrastructure, while reducing cost and transforming how we operate as a business. We've made great progress, and we're ahead of schedule. The next phase of LHX NeXt is centered around the supply chain management and leveraging the scale of our enterprise. This will improve cost, quality, and delivery for our customers, while simultaneously offering our suppliers demand stability and an opportunity to grow along with us. And for us, it means supply chain management will be a competitive discriminator. Turning to capital deployment, as promised we are prioritizing debt pay down, continuing to maintain a competitive dividend, and returning excess capital to shareholders. In the quarter, we returned over $300 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and remain on track to meet our stated 2024 target of approximately $500 million in share repurchases, holding outstanding shares flat year-over-year. Aligned with our national security focus, we recently completed the sale of our antennas business, and expect to finalize the pending divestiture of our commercial aviation business later this year, as we satisfy the remaining conditions to close. And finally, I want to thank the four Board Members who served on our Ad Hoc business review committee. Their recommendations were presented to the Board last week, and we are implementing actions in accordance with those recommendations. The focus was on reviewing our strategy and portfolio, program management, disciplined bidding processes, and LHX NeXt plans. The Business Review Committee executed as per its charter, and as such is now dissolved. As recommendations are appreciated, and as I noted, are being executed in a rapid manner to continue to drive value for shareholders and customers. I'll now turn it over to Ken to provide insight on our second quarter results and 2024 guidance. Sure, Peter. I appreciate the question. With respect to Aerojet, I would say, look, the business is performing well halfway through the year. We're happy about the margin performance. There's certainly some aspects of mix in terms of which programs are seeing the volumes at which point through the year as well as we performed in the first half, we were able to see some positive program performance that we've got to go do again in the second half of the year. So we feel good about how Aerojet Rocketdyne is performing. And it's been about a year since we've integrated this business, and we're continuing to learn more. I think you saw that the purchase accounting period ended as well. So we've got that kind of information behind us better informed with the improvements that we're making and how we're driving operational improvements in the business. And we'll work to continue to deliver on that in the second half and see if we can replicate what we did in the first half of the year. Good morning Rob. Yes, Rob, it's tough to look at one quarter for a bookings or book-to-bill ratio for year-to-date. We're feeling pretty good as to what we've been able to book, had a great first quarter. So one quarter doesn't make a year. I think our portfolio is well positioned, and we're continuing to be disciplined in what we bid. And I think you're seeing that in the results, especially on the margin front. Some of the prior strategic decisions we made to invest and go after prime positions with SDA for satellites, maybe changing our waveform strategy, what we're doing with counter UAS with VAMPIRE winning billable [ph] watch. All those programs are starting to pay off. And as Ken mentioned, we've really upped our program management and execution with training new tools, hiring experienced hires externally where appropriate. And we talk about bidding discipline. Just making sure we have the right contract type. I think we were one of the first to come out and say, we are not going to bid fixed-price development programs with options at the proposal process. And we're doing a lot better, getting the cost basis and asking for a reasonable fee. So we're taking our time, and we're negotiating. And I would expect the third quarter, we'll see a bump relative to the book-to-bill. Absolutely. I actually was in attendance at the defense summit as part of the NATO Summit in D.C. with the various Ministers of Defense and international customer leadership. And it was a different tone than in the past. And I think you're hitting on an excellent point. I think most U.S. companies don't view Europe as a growth market or even much of a market because of the indigenous capabilities that exist. But the theme at the NATO Summit was all about interoperability and the need for these countries to either bundle acquisitions or have their products work and with the conflict in Ukraine I think everybody sees the benefit of the interoperability, not only amongst the 32 member countries, which includes the U.S., but given the threat profile in Europe. So in our case, we look at our software-defined radios as a perfect example. I think we're uniquely positioned there and there was a lot of interest in that. And back at the envelope, we think this could be 100,000 radio opportunity in the years ahead. So Europe is one of our larger markets that we're now going after for all the reasons you mentioned, Ron. And I think that's a nice upside for 2024 and it should give us some tailwind in the years ahead. Yes. Thanks for that question, Kristine. I'll just say I thought it was a good review. We all learned from the process, and I'd say all parties, both the members of the Ad Hoc business review committee and management benefited from the discussion and it has no change on our 2026 financial framework. And the ideas, suggestions, and discussions were beneficial, and we're already implementing some recommendations, and we'll continue to do so throughout the year. Yes. Thanks, Myles. As I said, we have about $32 billion in backlog way up from when the company was formed five years ago. I guess I really see three major areas. The DoD modernization we've been talking about for quite some time. And if you go back, there was a basis of issue, what we call BOI to buy 480,000 radios from us and our competitors. To date, we've delivered 180,000. So there's still a 300,000 radio opportunity. And clearly, as these IDIQs have annual task orders we've been rather successful in winning our fair share or more than our fair share. And I expect that to continue. During the pandemic, we actually invested in capacity up in Rochester. We've come up with some new techniques. We have what we call our Smart cell, which is a different way of integrating radios. We've seen our yields improve. We're using a smaller footprint and it's really changing the way that we integrate our radios. We continue to invest in software. We have some new wave forms and I think it's important to remember, these are software-defined radios. So the hardware probably has a 10 to 15-year life. So there'll be a replenishment of that. But more importantly, there's a continuous demand for the software and the upgrade. So the DoD modernization as far as we can see, continues to look good, the budgets will come out and they'll adjust the quantities based on that, but there's clear demand here in the U.S. I mentioned the NATO in an earlier question, again, we see a huge opportunity for NATO with that focus on interoperability, and we continue to have success around the globe with our software-defined radios and the whole focus on resilient comms. I think that's one of the lessons learned. There was a big difference between just being able to communicate and communicate in a resilient, protected fashion in our networks are coming out as world-class in that regard. And I've alluded to our software and waveforms. We're continuing to see demand for our resilient wave forms. And this is one of two markets, it is either an upsell for a new software-defined radio or it's a licensing opportunity for the installed base. So just on CS, we have about a $16 billion pipeline looking out three years. As I mentioned, $10 billion international, the rest domestic. So we feel real good about the business and the growth potential and just to close off, we don't see any supply chain issues or constraints as we have in the prior years, which gives us even further confidence in the outlook. Alright, Sheila, let me start and then maybe I'll have Ken chime in. Starting with space, again, I think that is the example. We keep holding up of what the benefit of the merger was in our trusted disruptor strategy. As I've said before, we're the only company to have been awarded Tranche 1 and 2 for the tracking layer and the RFI for Tranche 3 just came out. So the timing appears to be a little slower than we would have liked, but we're confident in our ability to continue with the SDA. On the transport layer, we've taken the strategy of being a merchant supplier. So we'll have content on the transport layer as well when that is awarded and the classified continues to be a strength. So space and intel and cyber are the growth markets, those are core competencies for us, and that's where the customer demand is. We also have in there our Mission Network FAA work, which is pretty stable, low single-digit growth. And then again, as you mentioned, the airborne continues to have headwinds as a lot of these missions are moving from air to space. And we continue to have great capabilities on mission systems. So to the extent [indiscernible] is awarded, we have opportunities there, CCA, we have opportunities there. And in the interim, we continue to support F-35, F-16, F-18 and the such. So I think it's a story of space and intel growing and airborne continuing to be flat to down based on our customers' strategies and acquisition approaches. Ken? Yes. Let me Michael, give a little bit of an overview on Aerojet because it's been a year since we closed and 18 months since we announced the deal. So I like to look at this acquisition, as I said, 18 months ago, strategically, operationally and financially. So I'll give some highlights for the first two and then ask Ken to comment on your specific question. I will tell you, we're not going to disclose book-to-bill by segment at this time. So I appreciate the question, but you're not going to get an answer to that one. But strategically, I think as I've said before, and I'd say, again, I feel much better about this acquisition today than I did 12 months or 18 months ago. And it's clear that the demand is well in excess of the supply and you see that by lots of companies wanting to spend hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to enter this new market. So we are well, well positioned. And I think when I look at our portfolio, this is one of the faster-growing opportunities for L3Harris. Operationally, there were some serious challenges that we've talked about. We've upgraded the talent pretty much across the board. We've doubled our on-time deliveries in 12 months, and we literally have thousands of overdue deliveries that we've cut by 40% in 12 months, our project will be 60% reduced by the end of the year. So we have red yellow green programs. We're getting more and more green programs each quarter. The customer relation is great. The technology is a discriminator. I can go on that longer if someone wants to know, but we have two pulse solid rocket motors. We have liquid and solid divert attitude control systems, Hypersonics is a huge opportunity over the long term. And we're continuing to invest. We're breaking ground in Virginia next week on a new building. We've opened a couple in Camden. We have our hovens [ph] in arriving later this month. We have new mixers coming in by the end of the year. So everything is paying off. We're investing our own money. We're using DoD DPA money, we're using prime co-investment money and it's a great market, and we love working for our primes and supporting them in their ultimate missile deliveries. So I just thought I wanted to give that context as to how much progress we've made in 12 months. Ken, do you want to answer the financial questions? Sure. So two-part question. Let me address the what I think was SDA Tranche 3 question first. And there, I think, is an RFI that hit the street, and we certainly don't want to get ahead of our customer in terms of what that looks like. But we are excited to be the only company that's been successful on Tranches is 0, 1 and 2. We will be analyzing that RFI and providing responses and certainly bidding as that RFP comes out. And it looks like maybe what was potentially a late 2024 might not be a 2025 acquisition from the government for that particular one. And from a quantity perspective, I don't have that precise number in front of me, but I think it's either similar to Tranche 2 or I believe the overall quantity is similar to Tranche 2, I guess the ultimate question is, do they continue with 3 providers or move to 2 type of things. So we'll continue to work through that, but feeling really good about it, and I think we're making good progress on that program. In terms of the second part of the question on LHX margin profile, yes, absolutely we are driving the LHX NeXt program for a couple of reasons, one of which is to enable us to deliver margin opportunity, but also to drive value for our customers as well. And that's not just from a cost perspective but also includes schedule as the trusted disruptor, the ability to listen to our customers, and respond quickly and provide capability at pace. But in terms of the specifics with respect to the cost savings, we have estimated roughly that about 40% of the savings will accrue to the company in terms of additional margin opportunities. So against the $1 billion of savings, we talked about essentially $400 million of opportunity from a margin perspective. And we'll certainly work hard to continue to drive up both the amount of the savings, as I think we're executing well on LHX NeXt and moving towards and gaining confidence towards our $1 billion target. So we'll work to make sure we get at least that amount. And then obviously, working to see if we can maintain as much of that as opportunity for margin improvement benefit at the company as well. You may remember at the time of the merger, we did realize I think, something between 50% and 60% of the integration savings. LHX NeXt is a little bit more of an enduring kind of three-year program versus the quicker integration. And because of that, we're projecting that a little bit more of it will accrue back to the government, which is a good thing. It enables us to be more competitive, win more new business as we look forward. But we'll certainly be working to see if we can find ways to realize margin improvements. And it may not be direct improvements out of the program, but as we return cost savings to the programs, and they can think about how they perform better and are able to turn that into future profitability that we can bank down the road for future program performance, we'll certainly think about that as well. So I think the -- at the end of the day, the story is LHX NeXt, we are performing very well. I think we're ahead of schedule. I think we're building confidence, got more confidence today than we did just a quarter ago, and we will certainly work to drive as much of that into margin opportunity as we can. So thanks, Jason. Sure, Rich and I appreciate the question and it hasn't been asked previously so we're good on that front. In terms of free cash flow guide, we're at $2.2 billion for the year. And as I think about halfway through the year, we're roughly 25% to our full year guidance. It's certainly not a profile that we are uncomfortable with. It's kind of about where we are normally this far through the year. We've got a fair amount of cash to generate in the second half, but we're comfortable, absolutely reiterating the guidance at $2.2 billion. And I don't think we're expecting any working capital build necessarily in the second half, but we've got to work with our customers, get the payments coming in the door, work with our suppliers, making sure we're paying the term on those fronts. And the way I would characterize it, similar to Jason's question on LHX NeXt is we're building confidence to our guide and maybe as importantly, we're sticking with our guidance in the 2026 financial framework of $2.2 billion in 2024, $2.4 billion in 2025, and $2.8 billion in 2026. And that's kind of the bigger picture that we're thinking about is how we continue to build confidence into that increasing free cash flow as we grow the business. And quite frankly, as we get the net leverage targets where we need to be, hopefully, by the end of 2024, and we start to deploy capital with more -- a little more of a tilt towards share repurchase, really driving our ability to see some free cash flow per share growth as we look out into 2025 and 2026. So feeling really good about it. I think it's a great profile, and I think it's a really solid part of our story with that midterm financial framework. And again, I think we're just building confidence towards that, and I feel really good about it. So thanks for the question, Rich. Yes, Peter, great question. The whole undersea and autonomy markets are growth markets for us. I would say on the undersea, what we're seeing more is on the sea beds, the sensors, a lot of classified work, which are not the autonomous ones. We refer to those as grotto and there's a big opportunity coming up almost $1 billion where we're competing. This would be the third opportunity, we won two already. So that could be a real growth engine for maritime. Relative to the autonomy, we still are doing well on the autonomous surface vehicles. I think the Navy is still developing its autonomous strategy and relative to the unmanned undersea, these are relatively inexpensive products. So we continue to invest. We've had great success with our Torpedo launch and recovery using an unmanned undersea vehicle, which is kind of a game changer. But we can highlight it more, but these are literally -- you sell 20, 30, 40 of these. It just doesn't add up to a lot of money, but it's critical to the mission and we should be able to start seeing some export opportunities here in the years ahead. So still part of the portfolio, it is still doing well. Just the price of the products are relatively inexpensive and probably don't roll up to the materiality to talk about them, but we'll try to do more in the future. Yes, Ken. Good to hear from you. Domestically, they tend to split the buys, as we've talked about before, 60-40, 70-30 and such, and we're usually the winner of the majority share. But internationally, it is a winner-take-all environment. And generally, we've had great success. And again, these are relatively inexpensive compared to other weapon systems or products out there. So the price is not really that much of a differentiator and pricing strategy, we have a price target. We have -- we know what the costs are and as you know, we get reasonably good margins in this business. So we don't plan on lowering the prices and the customers see the benefit of our technology and again, the interoperability. So we try to cut a fair business deal. But I feel real good about what we're doing. And we've been able to take cost out through our LHX NeXt initiatives. We're getting dual source suppliers. So we don't have single points of failures across the company, but especially in CF and feel real good about this portfolio and the market opportunities. So I think we're going to be in good shape. I'm not going to mention any specific countries, but there's a lot of big opportunities here in Europe that are going through the FMS process and we should have a good second half of the year. Good morning. Yes. It's built into the guide. And again, it's always hard to predict the actual quantity and timing and the congressional approval process. But a lot of that money for a variety of countries flows our way, either directly in the radios, a little bit on night vision goggles, and then indirectly through the solid rocket motors supporting the primes for the ammunitions. So I think that gives us confidence and stability in our guide. And as you suggest, some of this should roll into 2025 as we make the deliveries in the next 12 to 18 months. So with that, before we sign off, I always like to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication. We believe we're truly changing the industry, and I'm proud of what they've accomplished and we've accomplished in the last five years. We're very optimistic about the future, and we look forward to talking to everybody in the months ahead. So thanks for joining the call today. Have a good weekend."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. \n It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mark Kratz, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may now begin, Mr. Kratz. \nMark Kratz: Thank you, Rob. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me this morning are Chris Kubasik, our CEO; and Ken Bedingfield, our CFO. Yesterday, we published our first quarter earnings release detailing our financial results and guidance. We also provided a supplemental earnings presentation on our website. \n As a reminder, today's discussion will include certain constitute forward-looking statements. These statements involve risks, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For more information, please reference our earnings release and our SEC filings. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to GAAP measures in the earnings release. \n I'd now like to turn it over to Chris. \nChristopher Kubasik: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Since the merger of L3 and Harris 5 years ago and after strategic acquisitions and targeted divestitures, we have built a company with a national security focus. We have critical technologies in all domains that align to national security priorities and the global threat environment. Responsive space, resilient communications and rocket motors are critical for the future fight. The trusted disruptor strategy and our portfolio are setting the stage for L3Harris to differentiate ourselves with top line growth while simultaneously increasing our industry-leading margins. \n The global security environment continues to be one with heightened tensions and regional conflict. Domestically, Congress recently passed the 2024 Appropriations Bill, which included $844 billion for defense. Our programs are well funded, and we are positioned for profitable growth across much of the enterprise. Demand remains strong for our products and solutions as we started off the year with a 1.06x book-to-bill ratio.\n Internationally, we continue to see a strong and geographically diverse pipeline of opportunities. As an example, we were recently awarded a $150 million program to provide secure networking to Taiwan, displacing a long-time incumbent. This win is an integral part of our interoperability and supports the CJADC2 mission. \n Turning to tactical radios. We maintain a robust international pipeline of over $10 billion, including several FMS cases, primarily for Europe, totaling more than $1 billion. These opportunities, along with the continued strong backlog, give us confidence in an international tactical radio ramp in the second half of the year. Other international opportunities are supported by the DoD's supplemental funding, particularly in Ukraine. \n Earlier this week, the President signed a foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan that includes $67 billion in funding for key defense programs. L3Harris has been a key supplier in Ukraine since the start of the conflict, and the need for this equipment remains strong. \n Our products are being used in theater and exceeding expectations. The supplemental bill will provide our allies access to needed capabilities while at the same time support the U.S. defense industrial base, including small and midsized businesses. With the bill just recently passed, we will give you more information during the next earnings call on the incremental opportunities that it provides. Our workforce is proud to support our country and its allies around the globe. \n Turning to 2024. Our strong first quarter results reflect improvement across our diverse set of programs and products. We're executing on our contracts and improving cost and schedule performance, which helped drive net positive EACs for the second consecutive quarter. In our product businesses, we are improving quality and driving higher on-time deliveries. \n Turning to programs. I see development risk abating. This is not to say that we're out of the woods on all of our development programs, but the business is performing well and the disciplined bidding focus and programmatic rigor is starting to pay off. LHX NeXt cost savings are also starting to contribute, and we see that benefit accelerating in 2024 and 2025. \n Ken will cover the financials in more detail, but I wanted to highlight that revenue was up double-digit year-over-year and operating income was up $150 million, resulting in margins expanding 80 basis points to 15.1%. Given the strong start to the year, we are raising our 2024 margin EPS and revenue guidance while reaffirming our free cash flow commitments. \n At our Investor Day, we committed to $1 billion in LHX NeXt gross cost savings by 2026, focused on optimizing our workforce infrastructure and supply chain. The initiative will enable us to maintain our industry-leading margins while investing in technologies, tools and systems to support our customers and employees. We are accelerating our LHX NeXt activity in 2024. And earlier this month, we implemented a workforce reduction that will result in about 5% fewer people than when we began the year. With these reductions, we are focused on eliminating noncore processes, streamlining our organizational structure to maximize efficiency and rightsizing our physical footprint. \n To summarize. Our actions to date have put us ahead of our gross run rate savings target of $400 million by the end of the year. There's more work to do, and I am confident in our LHX NeXt leadership team and know that our collective efforts will yield the $1 billion savings target, as previously committed. \n Operationally, we continue to make progress within our Aerojet Rocketdyne segment. Since closing the acquisition, we've implemented processes and tools, which have helped reduce late deliveries by 20%. We've returned multiple programs back to green, and we continue to work with our customers and the DoD to accelerate and improve deliveries of these critical products and to support future growth. \n Aligned with that growth, it was recently announced that we were selected to be the primary propulsion provider for the Missile Defense Agency's next-generation interceptor. We anticipate this to be a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the life of the program. \n Outside of operations, our finance team saw an opportunity to refinance some variable rate debt and replace it with fixed rate notes, saving 150 basis points. On capital deployment. We increased our dividend for the 23rd consecutive year, and we were able to get back into the share repurchase market in Q1, executing about half of the 2024 share repurchase target. We expect about $1 billion in gross proceeds from the previously announced divestitures, which will largely be used to reduce our leverage below our 3.0 target ratio. \n We remain focused on achieving the financial framework we laid out at Investor Day, and our first quarter results are a solid step forward towards delivering on our commitments. \n I'll now turn it over to Ken to provide additional perspective. \nKenneth Bedingfield: Thanks, Chris. Let's start with consolidated results for the quarter. We reported solid gains of $5.5 billion, including over $900 million for SDA tracking Tranche 2, nearly $150 million for U.S. Marine Corps and SOCOM handheld tactical radios, and an international award for a NATO country for missionized business jets that leverages our domestic ISR capabilities. \n Backlog remains at over $32 billion and supports margin expansion opportunity as we move forward given operational improvements and recent bidding discipline. Revenue grew 17% and 5% organically with growth in 3 of our 4 segments. Revenue at IMS reflects aircraft procurements in Q1 '23, resulting in lower sales in Q1 2024. As Chris mentioned, operating margins expanded to 15.1%, up 80 basis points from improved operational and program performance while also starting to see the benefits of LHX NeXt. \n EPS grew 7% to $3.06 per share primarily from segment operating margin performance, partially offset by higher interest expense and lower pension income. On a pension-adjusted basis, first quarter EPS was up over 10%. Free cash was an outflow of $156 million as first quarter cash flows are typically the lowest of the year. As you will recall, we derisked 2024 cash taxes at the end of '23, and we remain confident in delivering free cash flow growth this year to $2.2 billion. \n I'd now like to turn to some segment details for the quarter. I highlighted earlier that revenue grew 17% from the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne and organic growth in our SAS and CS segments as we continue to see strong demand for Space Systems and Tactical Communications businesses. \n On margins. We drove operational improvements throughout each of our 4 segments. In SAS, we are making progress on development programs, including the recent launch of 5 L3Harris missile-tracking satellites as part of the SDA tracking Tranche 0 and HBTSS programs. With these space investments and risk largely behind us, we are beginning to realize the benefits of the new growth areas and maturing processes as we move forward. These efficiencies were a contributing factor in expanding SAS margins by 100 basis points in the quarter. \n We made progress on program performance, resulting in a $75 million improvement in net EACs versus the first quarter of 2023. These were driven by improvements in all segments as our focus on operational rigor continues to pay dividends. This was most prominent in our CS segment, where the Integrated Vision System sector saw stronger results. The Tactical Data Link business continues to perform well as we realize synergy benefits of a consolidated business within our broadband communications sector. And in Tactical Communications, which drove solid results with an increased level of lower-margin DoD deliveries, we anticipate it will continue through the first half of the year. \n On capital allocation. Our plan remains the same. We will continue to focus on deleveraging the balance sheet before we look at opportunities to accelerate share repurchase beyond offsetting dilution. During the first quarter, we returned over $450 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. \n Moving on to 2024 guidance. We are tightening our revenue range of $20.8 billion to $21.3 billion, while we reaffirm our free cash flow commitment of $2.2 billion. We are increasing total company margin guidance for the year to greater than 15% versus prior guidance of approximately 15%. This increase is most notable in SAS, where we now expect margins of approximately 12%, up from prior guidance of mid- to high 11%. Outside of operations, we are also updating our guidance for pension income. At the end of last year, we combined the acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne pension assets with our own. Our actuarial update is more positive than our new outlook, so we have updated those figures accordingly. \n Lastly on guidance. We are increasing our earnings guidance to a range of $12.70 to $13.05 per share, up from prior guidance of $12.40 to $12.80. From a modeling perspective, I would continue to point out that our CS segment will have a heavier DoD tactical mix in the first half that has less margin opportunity than international programs. Interest expense will also remain elevated in the second quarter. Both trends should reverse as we make our way into the second half of the year, along with a second half-weighted free cash flow profile. Overall, a good start to 2024, and we remain focused on executing to deliver on commitments to our customers and our shareholders. \n With that, let's open the line for questions. Rob? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. \nNoah Poponak: Chris, I wanted to ask, you have the trusted disruptor strategy, and you've talked about you've been trying to prime more and kind of growing the profile and the size in the sector and that's been working to a degree. Now that we're seeing, I think, some new entrants in the space, try the same thing and maybe have a little more success than they've had in the past, how do you think about that? I mean does that crowd that effort for you? Or is the pie big enough for multiple companies to do that? And then, Ken, just one clarification on the LHX NeXt. Will you -- will all of that be adjusted out of earnings? And is all of that cash or some of that noncash? \nChristopher Kubasik: All right. Noah, thanks for the question. Yes, I think our strategy is working, as I said, and the portfolio is well aligned. Relative to the pie between the supplemental and the fiscal year '24 budget, we're well over $900 billion. So I think there's plenty of DoD funding. \n Relative to the new entrants, which sometimes I like to think of us as one since we're 5 years old, but I know where you're going with your question. We've taken the approach to team and work collaboratively with these new entrants at the highest level. So a lot of the new entrants tend to be a little more software-focused. I think the traditional, including ourselves, are a little more hardware-focused. So we're working collaboratively. \n There's been some recent awards in Q1 where we are actually a subcontractor to a new entrant that want a significant program. And sometimes, they work under us. So I would say we're embracing them and working collaboratively with them. And of course, I've talked about our Shield investments in the past and working with those venture capital companies who are much smaller but also have great technology. So I think it's working, and that's been our approach. Ken? \nKenneth Bedingfield: Yes. No, from an LHX NeXt perspective, we are adjusting out the implementation costs of the program and certainly then trying to leverage the benefits of LHX NeXt in the businesses. We talked about what that target looked like for 2024, and the businesses are off working hard to operationalize that and reflect that benefit in their performance. And I think you're starting to see that here in the first quarter. And then from a cash perspective, we're primarily just adjusting out the cash severance costs related to the program. And you'll see all that reflected in the schedules to the earnings release. \nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. Look, we've gotten the feedback relative to our disclosures. So under Ken's leadership, we're trying to cut back on these onetime non-GAAP adjustments and be much more transparent. So I think it will be all laid out clear for you to analyze. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. \nPeter Skibitski: Chris, how does the win on NGI with your partner, how does that impact your outlook for Aerojet? And also considering as you mentioned, the fiscal '24 supplementals, do you get more bullish about your ability to hit that $26 billion target -- $23 billion, I should say? \nChristopher Kubasik: $23 billion and $26 billion? Yes, absolutely. No, NGI, which is designed to protect the U.S. against evolving long-range ballistic missile threats, is a huge win for the OEM. We were a merchant supplier, as I've talked about before, on both teams. So this definitely gives us a tailwind.\n When we looked -- I went back and looked at our deal model, this really was not factored in when we made the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne. So from that perspective, it's going to be accretive, at least, to our own internal goals. Aerojet Rocketdyne is a great technology, especially with the large solid rocket motors. But the quantities are still to be determined. It's going to start as a development program.\n We're in discussions, obviously, with the Prime. We haven't actually been awarded and signed a contract yet. But as you saw in the media, we were selected as a propulsion provider. So it's very exciting. And again, I think it will be a slower ramp as you would imagine. But '25-'26 time frame, I think we'll start to see the revenue hit our financials. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. \nKristine Liwag: Since you formed a new Business Review Committee back in December, can you give us any color on how progress has been? What are the key areas that have come under focus? And how this compares to your LHX NeXt pipe initiatives as well?  Do they overlap? \nChristopher Kubasik: Yes, Kristine, it's Chris. We did set up the ad hoc Business Review Committee of the Board comprised of 4 Board members, as you saw. We've been meeting a couple of times a month for a few hours each. And we brought through a variety of topics that have been laid out in the charter that we filed in the 8-K.\n I would say from anything from operations, we've looked at the programs, they've reviewed the program review process, the bidding process, the LHX NeXt strategy and goals. They've reviewed the portfolio, our capital deployment strategy. And we're just kind of checking through the items in the charter. Some topics are one meeting, some topics are 2 meetings. I feel like we're about halfway through the process, maybe a little more.\n And then probably middle of the year or so, the BRC will report out to our Board of Directors with observations and recommendations and findings. So I'd say it's been a very collaborative process. I think it's been good for the company, and it's a good way to orient some new Board members quickly about the company and what we're trying to accomplish. So I'd say all is going well to this point. So more to come. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Gavin Parsons with UBS. \nGavin Parsons: Wanted to ask on the nearly 100 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. If there's a way to parse that out between the drivers? I know a lot of them go hand in hand, but how much of that is NeXt versus EACs, repricing for inflation, mix and so on? Just if there's a way to think about what the drivers were in buckets. \nKenneth Bedingfield: Yes. Gavin, it's Ken. I would say that we're seeing improvement in the kind of the high-level buckets across the board. I would say we're seeing some mix benefits in terms of, as Chris mentioned, kind of moving out of some of the development phase of contracts and into some of the more mature phase.\n From a mix perspective, we are seeing some of the areas of the business that are a higher mix of cost-plus growing. So as an example, space within SAS was a strong grower and has a bit of a higher cost-plus mix. So that kind of works the other way a little bit.\n But we are seeing some of the disciplined bidding start to come through in terms of confidence in our ability to perform as well as price discipline and then just performing on our programs and certainly LHX NeXt contributing. And I wouldn't want to put numbers on each of the individual buckets. But largely, as we think about kind of how you bridge from last year to this year for the most part, each of those major buckets are contributing. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. \nPeter Arment: Chris and Ken, you've made a lot of progress already on -- starting on LHX NeXt. And I think about 1/3 of it is tied to your gross saving targets, is tied to labor reductions. You recently made an announcement there. If you could just give us a little more color on how you think things will evolve on what's optimal for LHX and then in related to all the actions that you've been taking. Also on portfolio shaping, just in terms of any future kind of thoughts that you've had on further shaping the portfolio. \nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. No. Thanks, Peter. So yes, the workforce is probably the quick hitter for what we need to do for LHX NeXt. And as you said, that got us about 1/3 of the way there. The next part is going to be a little more timely and a little more complicated. And the facilities, I think, are going to be a key part of it.\n Looking at the infrastructure. We have a goal of getting from 275 facilities down to 200. We have about 7 or 8 that we've identified that we'll start the process here in the second quarter. So that will have a little bit of cost to move and relocate and consolidate, but these would be smaller entities that the business case is better to consolidate into a larger facility.\n We're continuing to reduce our ERP systems. We've invested in some technology called the unified data layer to get us access by laying on top of all of our systems to be able to get data more quickly. And then, of course, we talked about the initiatives in IT. Ultimately getting, believe it or not, from 98 data centers -- I'm sorry, 85 data centers down to 2. So that's the infrastructure. That's going to take some time, and that's why it's going to lead into 2025 and 2026.\n We've already kicked off with the indirect procurement. We've effectively outsourced that, taking advantage of the buying power of that enterprise. So that's both a combination of price and quantity. So we're tracking to that. And then ultimately, we called it the supply chain, but it's really beyond the supply chain. It's the integration of all the functions that are critical to our products with the overall goal of reducing the cost of our products. So there's an engineering component, there's clearly a supply chain component, contracting and such. So that process is ongoing, but that's where we're going to get the next $600 million or so of savings.\n To your question on portfolio shaping. As you know, we have 2 that are in process. I'll just give you an update there. The antenna business, which we announced, a couple of hundred million dollars that's tracking to close the middle of this year, second quarter to be specific. And then our commercial aviation is going to be more in the second half of the year. That'll give us the $1 billion of proceeds.\n Relative to the rest of the portfolio, we're just taking a hard look at that. We're going to be able to hit our leverage ratio based on these 2. And to the extent we can get a good price for what we've identified as noncore, we'll do it. But too many of the offers are coming in low, and people think we're desperate to sell, and I can assure you, we're not. So we need to get better valuations before we proceed on other transactions. Otherwise, we'll keep and run the business and go forward from there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citigroup. \nJason Gursky: Chris, would you spend a few minutes kind of walking around the Communications business? And maybe give us some updated thoughts since you last reported out on the funding environment. We've had fiscal '24 that got passed; '25, they got introduced. We've had some supplementals as well. And just kind of give us your take on how this plays out over the next couple of years and maybe offer up some comments on Link 16 and the expected refresh of all that hardware and when that kind of hits. Just what have we learned here over the last couple of 3 months on the Communications business? \nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. Thanks, Jason. So let me start with Link 16. Again, we have a footprint on 20,000 platforms, and then there's variations of Link 16 and other data links that we've developed that are going to be able to go into those platforms or footprint. So I think we're starting to see that. Our ultimate goal was to get Link 16 into space.\n I can tell you for the SDA transport opportunities that are coming up, our team is going to be a merchant supplier. And as of now, it looks like we're going to be on all the teams providing Link 16-type capability and space. So we're excited about that.\n Relative to the Communication Systems, I want to reiterate the opportunity that we won in Taiwan, $150 million for networking, which was a cross-company win led by our Communications segment. So that's a big deal for us. And as I mentioned, it really supports the CJADC2 initiative that our country has been talking about for quite some time.\n Relative to the radios, I mean, this is just absolute good news. I know we've been talking about modernization, not only here in the U.S. but globally. And as I mentioned, we have 6 FMS cases that are currently going through the process, through the system in Europe. The backlog is going to be record backlog. Even in Q1, we were able to get the marine and the SOCOM radio orders booked.\n And there's a certain capacity and ability to deliver out of our Rochester facility, And it really comes, to be honest, how quickly we can get these supplemental funds under contract and approved and delivered. And with our trusted disruptor strategy, our business model actually allows us to potentially deliver radios within a week of getting the contract, depending on the configuration in the country.\n So the way I look at it, we have high confidence in the guidance we've given. We clearly have the second half ramp up. But which countries will get which radios will really be a factor of when the funding turns into a contract. And those that don't get signed and delivered in 2024 will clearly be 2025. So just feel better about the business in a huge way. And again, the products, our in-theater being tested daily, and they're working and exceeding expectation. And the whole focus on resilient communications is paying off. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. \nKenneth Herbert: Chris and Ken, maybe just a 2-part question. First, on the Communications segment. You, obviously, did 24% margins in the first quarter. The guidance implies some slight ramp in the second half, but it clearly sounds like with international mix and maybe a little bit of a depressed second quarter, there could be some upside to that. Can you just talk about if there's anything onetime in the segment in the first quarter? And any puts and takes there we should think about as we think about the second quarter? \n And then just -- or the second half of the year. And then just at a higher level, obviously, international seems to be a growing business, maybe faster than the U.S. Can you just talk about longer term, the margin impact of the international opportunity within the CS segment but then more broadly? \nKenneth Bedingfield: Sure. I'll take that one. So the first part of the question on CS margins. We delivered 24% margin in the first quarter, which I think was great performance by the CS team. And that does reflect a higher domestic mix than we saw late in '23 as well as a higher domestic mix than we expect to see in the second half of '24.\n We did guide low to mid 24% margin for CS for '24. And I think what we're trying to communicate is that we expect the domestic mix to be kind of consistent in the second quarter with the first quarter. Solid performance could yield similar results. But in driving that margin up to the low to mid 24% for the full year, we are looking at some international opportunities to realize some additional margin benefit as we think about that kind of full year impact. And I think -- so that's what we're trying to communicate on CS margins from a Q1 and full year '24 perspective.\n And then from the international side. Clearly, as Chris talked about in his prepared remarks and in response to Jason's question, a lot of international opportunity at certainly the CS segment. But as we look beyond that as well, we see international opportunity, in particular at IMS and certainly, the other segments have international components to their business. We don't necessarily track some of the ultimate end customer quite as closely in some of those. But the international margins tend to be stronger across the board.\n In my remarks, I talked about an ISR program by a NATO country. We would expect that would have strong margins as we, again, think about how we make those deliveries to our international allies and our country's partners, and recognizing the different risks and channels that come with those programs that should you perform, and we expect to be able to perform, will generate higher margins for the business. So we do see that continuing to move into the business.\n I will comment, CS clearly is the kind of the quickest-turn segment, the shorter-cycle segment in terms of ability to take international orders and turn it into sales. So just an example, that ISR program we talked about will be a multiyear program, and we'll see that kind of move into the revenue over a bit more time. But with that, I'll turn it to Chris for a few more comments. \nChristopher Kubasik: Yes, Ken. Just as a reminder, we're in the low 20% of our revenue comes from international customers, and part of our margin improvement strategy is to grow our international business. And just as a reminder, about half of that is foreign military sales, which has margins consistent with the DoD work for the most part, and the other half is direct commercial sale. And that's where we tend to have the higher margins. But as Ken said, more international is synonymous with higher margins, and that's where our focus is. These supplementals are a big step in the right direction. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Gautam Khanna with TD Cowen. \nGautam Khanna: Can you hear me, guys? \nChristopher Kubasik: Yes, we can. \nGautam Khanna: Terrific. I just had 2 quick questions. First, I was wondering if you could give us more granularity on the RF tactical backlog book-to-build trends. You mentioned something on SOCOM. And if you could just talk a little bit about overall mix this year and perhaps next in that business? And then I had a question on IMS EACs and if those have turned positive? And if not, what sort of still holding that segment back with respect to kind of the profit accruals? \nKenneth Bedingfield: Yes. From a tactical radio perspective, I would say we're -- had a solid bookings order in the quarter. We've got a very solid backlog for that business at this point in time, looking at a multibillion dollar backlog in that business. And for a pretty quick turn, our shortest-cycle business, that is a very robust backlog at this point in time. So we're excited about the opportunities.\n I would say the Marine Corps and SOCOM opportunity is a great one as we continue to expand that partnership with that very important customer for the business. We were also down-selected for the Air Force Next Gen Survival Radio, which is a great opportunity for that business to expand into a new market as well.\n And then clearly, the supplemental as Chris mentioned, and the international opportunities, so I think a huge opportunity in terms of really strong backlog at the Tactical Communications business. And as Chris mentioned, a great business model that enables them to kind of turn that factory pretty quick to deliver the radios to appropriate customers as needed based on critical demand and critical needs on the battlefield.\n At IMS, in terms of -- I think the question was about EACs. And I would say that as we talked about in the prepared remarks, every segment performed better from a net EAC perspective. IMS was a part of that, significantly better performance than Q1 '23. IMS is our longest-cycle business, and it takes a while to kind of turn those programs and the operations and get everything working through the system. I think IMS had great performance in the first quarter at 11.4%, working towards the guidance that we put out there for IMS for full year '24.\n And strong performance on their programs, I think really starting to stabilize both the operations in terms of rates, realizing some of the benefits of LHX NeXt as well as all the hard work that the sectors within IMS segment are doing to deliver on their programs. So we're really excited about kind of the stabilization and the continued strong performance as we look out into the remaining quarters of '24. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Research Partners. \nRichard Safran: Chris, Ken, Mark, I wanted to ask 2 things about Stand-in Attack. It was an opportunity for to be prime. And correct me if I'm wrong, I think you decided to no bid. We're hearing a lot more about too much risk being pushed to industry. One of your competitors just talked about adjusting for that in their bids. So I was curious about what your thinking is about bidding going forward. And what's the next opportunity for you to be prime? \nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. Thanks, Richard. I think I've been pretty consistent on the -- on our bidding strategy. We talked about the bidding discipline. It's been referenced a few times. There's 2 things going on there. A lot of people in this industry sending an inordinate amount of time and money trying to focus on a price-to-win strategy and hiring outside consultants. And we kind of find that interesting but irrelevant, so we've taken a different approach. \n What is our labor? What is our supply chain? What is overhead? And what's a reasonable fee? We add that up, and that's the bid we put in. And if it's deemed too high, we move on. And if it's appropriate based on our past performance and capabilities, we book the order. So that's a little bit of a change here over the last year or so.\n But more importantly is bidding the right types of contracts. And I think in Stand-in Attack weapon, it was a fixed-price contract for development, again, with fixed priced options. And we will not bid any programs where we are asked to give a fixed price on an option for a product that's yet to be developed. It's just plain and simple common sense. I think there are some people in the department that agree with me, and maybe there are others that don't. But you see what happens. In most of these negative EACs across the industry, when you do a root cause corrective action, more times than not, it's a bad contracting vehicle. Nobody is perfect, and there are performance issues, but you cannot perform of a bad contract. And that's what we're trying to do, I guess, on next opportunities to prime.\n I mean we have -- and again, we take an approach where is the best approach, either be a merchant supplier or a subcontractor or a prime based on our capabilities and what the customer needs.\n There was an Armed Overwatch. We've been successful there. We just got the delivery order 3. So we're up to 25 aircraft already. HADES, which is a big opportunity for the Army. It's the High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System. It's basically up to 14 aircraft. We're bidding a global 6,500. This aligns clearly with our ISR and other capabilities. So that would be a big win for us. We have some maritime, undersea ranges where we've primed, and there's some follow-on opportunities, a bunch in classified space. I usually get a space question for now, but I'll just plug that we had no satellites in orbit at the date of merger. \n We launched 6 in the quarter, and we've been awarded 60 SATS as prime, and there's more in the pipeline. So those come to mind just off the top of my head. And of course, we have a lot of opportunities at Aerojet Rocketdyne. And those are follow-on, but those are not prime programs. So I guess, SDA. I was thinking SDA Tranche 3 for tracking. As you know, we're the only company to have been awarded Tranche 0, 1 and 2 for a total of 38 satellites. We should get an RFP in the fourth quarter for Tranche 3, and that could be another 18 satellites. So hope that helps, Richard. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. \nDavid Strauss: I wanted to ask about the performance in the quarter. I think well above your full year guidance. So how are you thinking about that? And then if you could just touch on 2 programs out there in the press a lot where you're a supplier, F-35 Tier 3. And then how you're [indiscernible] those. \nKenneth Bedingfield: Yes. Thanks for the question, David. Appreciate it. I think you were breaking up a little bit, but I believe the question was about SAS performance in the quarter. And solid performance by the SAS team in the first quarter, 12.3% margin rate. And they are performing well on their programs. We talked a little bit about some of the drivers there, including maturing some of the development programs. And we also talked a little bit about the mix. And as space continues to grow, that's a little more cost-plus mix. That could temper a little bit of the margins in the last 3 quarters of the year.\n But we did update guidance for SAS to approximately 12% on the margin rate. They were 12.3% in the first quarter, some upside from EAC adjustments. And as we saw strong program performance, you've got to kind of book that in the quarter.\n You do -- it does result in a higher booking rate as you move forward, but you do pick up some cume catch adjustment that flows through in that 90-day period versus the full year impact where that gets tempered a little bit. But we're very confident in the team at SAS, and we're confident in the guide that we put out there for approximately 12%. And I know the SAS team is out there working hard as we speak to try to figure out how to drive that up from there. \nChristopher Kubasik: And I think second part of your question was F-35. Our production deliveries are tracking. We have a ramp coming up in production here starting next month. So we continue to have good relations with Lockheed. In fact, I was just talking to them yesterday. They'll be starting to deliver aircraft, as you know. They'll comment on that themselves. But as they start delivering aircraft, we're going to have to ramp up even further and quicker. And that's our plan. We've made the investments in most of the infrastructure we need. So continued improvement month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter. And it's all about the core processor, and that's where the focus of the team is. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. \nMatthew Akers: Chris, I wonder if you could comment on the international pipeline at IMS in particular. You mentioned the award in the quarter, but just curious if orders are kind of starting to move there. \nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. Thanks, Matt. I mean at IMS, we did get the NATO Electronic Attack Aircraft. And this -- we were thinking back on this not that long ago. I mean this is something about 8 years ago, 9 years ago. We talked about disrupting the market, and I always give the space example. But it feels like we pretty much invented and created this biz jet ISR market. We have over 50 biz jet orders in the last 8 or 9 years on 5 different platforms.\n So we have this one opportunity that I mentioned in Europe, NATO country. There's some longer-term opportunities kind of in the Mid East. These things take a year or 2 to get booked. So the biz jet market for electronic attack, ISR, whatever capabilities, are still out there. There's a huge opportunity in the Far East that we're on our third bid relative to being down-selected. So that could be a couple of billion dollars in 2025. So very excited about that.\n Armed Overwatch, we're starting to get interest from international customers. Once we start making deliveries later this year or early next year, I think that market is going to pick up from the aircraft side. And we still have some C130 capabilities that I believe have some international opportunities.\n Maritime, we're doing a lot of work with Australia. So we continue to see opportunities there as well. Viper Shield is actually out of SAS, but great capability on F-16 EW. So I see that growing as well. And then, of course, WESCAM with the turrets, that's just a high-growth market with opportunities pretty much all over the globe. \nKenneth Bedingfield: Yes. Chris, maybe I'll just add real quick on to that in terms of Armed Overwatch, so beyond biz jets at IMS. We did get a delivery order 3 on that program for 9 aircraft, I think, bringing the total order to 25. And to your comments, I think as that program matures, gives us greater confidence in the international opportunities for that aircraft. So looking to the building confidence on that one. \nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. \nSheila  Kahyaoglu: In the past, you guys have talked about revenue synergies with a lot of discussion today focused on LHX NeXt, which is clearly great because your profit was up over 20%. So Chris, you mentioned Taiwan, and you won a bid over a 20-year incumbent. Maybe is there any way to think about potential share gains and investment? What it means for the revenue top line outlook over the next few years? I know you laid out mid-single-digit targets, but how do we think about your revenue growth and market share gains? \nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. Thanks, Sheila. We're being selective in where we invest and bid. And if I look at the different domains, I think space is a perfect example where we are absolutely taking a market share. And as I said earlier, we've been awarded 60 satellites as a prime just since the merger, including 38 for SDA tracking alone.\n And there's -- it's a hot market. But every couple of weeks or months, you can pick up a paper and see there's one less company in this market, a lot of [ SPACs ]. A lot of companies are withdrawing from that market. And we take that as a sign of our success. We're making money and we've disrupted the market. So I feel really good about what we've done in space.\n The airborne domain, I think it's really going to be more with -- what I referenced with the business jets. Maybe Armed Overwatch, to a lesser degree, where again, we're filling in gaps and replacing long-term incumbents are giving them different platforms, with better capability for the missions that they want.\n Our maritime work on the undersea ranges is world-class. Again, you go back 6 years, we had no work in that regard, and we found an opportunity to unseat a long-term 40-year incumbent and came up with a different solution. And it's been well received around the globe, as an example.\n We've talked historically about our torpedo launch and recovery system using unmanned undersea vehicles. That market is a hot market, in my opinion. We just have to get out there and get a couple of customers, and I think that could be a real game changer for our undersea business.\n On the radios. We talk about the radios, a lot of good work there. An exciting one that we haven't really talked much about is for the Air Force, which is the Next Gen Survival Radio. So we're 1 of 2 companies competing on that. And in a couple of years, we could be down-selected a new market. And another example, dislodging a long-term incumbent.\n And then, of course, innovation in cyber. There's something going on there every day, and you kind of have to innovate daily to stay ahead of the threat. And we're doing that and seeing good growth and good performance in that domain as well. So I hope that answers your question. \nOperator: Our last question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. \nDouglas Harned: Chris, when -- I mean, right now, you're looking at Aerojet Rocketdyne, and demand in that market is just getting better and better. And you talked a little bit about the NGI win earlier. But when you look at the demand there, and I think back to -- I remember a year ago talking with you about the situation at Aerojet Rocketdyne, Camden, for example, and how serious the bottlenecks were in trying to get production up?\n So when you look at the business now, can you see the potential to ramp up? Can you talk about what kind of growth you could potentially get from that business? And then where you stand in the process of being able to get those bottlenecks out and really move production higher? \nChristopher Kubasik: Yes. Doug, great, great question. And yes, it was about 16 months ago when we announced this acquisition. And I think I agree with you. When I look at where we are now, the business case gets better and better. The demand, there was no conflict in Israel. People thought Ukraine would be done. Nobody anticipated a $900 billion of defense spending for 2024.\n So the tactical missiles, the nuclear deterrent, NGI, just tons of opportunities on SRMs. Over the long term, call it 5, 7 years, double-digit growth on the top line does not seem unreasonable to me. We have to, of course, invest in the capacity. The bottlenecks, some of them are based on low yields and performance and supply chain. I think we've made good progress in that regard, investing in our suppliers, getting additional suppliers.\n I continue to think the more money the government can give to the supply chain, the better off we are. I continue to believe we don't need an additional solid rocket motor prime. What we need is someone working on the igniters, the nozzles and the cases. And I think that would help unlock the potential.\n We've ordered equipment to continue to expand, whether it's mixers, ovens. They, unfortunately, tend to have a 50-, 60-week lead time, but we've placed those orders. And once we get that in, I think it's going to be -- help with the ramp. We have DPA money to build some buildings, take existing facilities and modify them. So the consolidation and [ piece ] dividend and Budget Control Act for a decade kind of stifle the ability for companies to invest and grow and inconsistent demand signals.\n But right now, I think everything is a potential tailwind. And we'll have the factories digitized by the end of this year, and we're making the investments and fixing the processes. So pretty excited about it. And 2024 is kind of catch up and continue to burn down the delinquent backlog and simultaneously invest and put in processes. But I think by the time we get to 2026, 2027, if all stays as is, it's going to really turn out to be a great acquisition.\n So I appreciate the question, Doug. And let me just wrap it up. And first of all, thank the workforce and the leadership team for a great first quarter. Obviously, thank you all for joining the call today. And Ken, Mark, myself and the team will be engaging with many of you in person in the months to come. \n So thank you all, and have a great weekend. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kenneth Bedingfield",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. Let's start with consolidated results for the quarter. We reported solid gains of $5.5 billion, including over $900 million for SDA tracking Tranche 2, nearly $150 million for U.S. Marine Corps and SOCOM handheld tactical radios, and an international award for a NATO country for missionized business jets that leverages our domestic ISR capabilities. \n Backlog remains at over $32 billion and supports margin expansion opportunity as we move forward given operational improvements and recent bidding discipline. Revenue grew 17% and 5% organically with growth in 3 of our 4 segments. Revenue at IMS reflects aircraft procurements in Q1 '23, resulting in lower sales in Q1 2024. As Chris mentioned, operating margins expanded to 15.1%, up 80 basis points from improved operational and program performance while also starting to see the benefits of LHX NeXt. \n EPS grew 7% to $3.06 per share primarily from segment operating margin performance, partially offset by higher interest expense and lower pension income. On a pension-adjusted basis, first quarter EPS was up over 10%. Free cash was an outflow of $156 million as first quarter cash flows are typically the lowest of the year. As you will recall, we derisked 2024 cash taxes at the end of '23, and we remain confident in delivering free cash flow growth this year to $2.2 billion. \n I'd now like to turn to some segment details for the quarter. I highlighted earlier that revenue grew 17% from the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne and organic growth in our SAS and CS segments as we continue to see strong demand for Space Systems and Tactical Communications businesses. \n On margins. We drove operational improvements throughout each of our 4 segments. In SAS, we are making progress on development programs, including the recent launch of 5 L3Harris missile-tracking satellites as part of the SDA tracking Tranche 0 and HBTSS programs. With these space investments and risk largely behind us, we are beginning to realize the benefits of the new growth areas and maturing processes as we move forward. These efficiencies were a contributing factor in expanding SAS margins by 100 basis points in the quarter. \n We made progress on program performance, resulting in a $75 million improvement in net EACs versus the first quarter of 2023. These were driven by improvements in all segments as our focus on operational rigor continues to pay dividends. This was most prominent in our CS segment, where the Integrated Vision System sector saw stronger results. The Tactical Data Link business continues to perform well as we realize synergy benefits of a consolidated business within our broadband communications sector. And in Tactical Communications, which drove solid results with an increased level of lower-margin DoD deliveries, we anticipate it will continue through the first half of the year. \n On capital allocation. Our plan remains the same. We will continue to focus on deleveraging the balance sheet before we look at opportunities to accelerate share repurchase beyond offsetting dilution. During the first quarter, we returned over $450 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. \n Moving on to 2024 guidance. We are tightening our revenue range of $20.8 billion to $21.3 billion, while we reaffirm our free cash flow commitment of $2.2 billion. We are increasing total company margin guidance for the year to greater than 15% versus prior guidance of approximately 15%. This increase is most notable in SAS, where we now expect margins of approximately 12%, up from prior guidance of mid- to high 11%. Outside of operations, we are also updating our guidance for pension income. At the end of last year, we combined the acquired Aerojet Rocketdyne pension assets with our own. Our actuarial update is more positive than our new outlook, so we have updated those figures accordingly. \n Lastly on guidance. We are increasing our earnings guidance to a range of $12.70 to $13.05 per share, up from prior guidance of $12.40 to $12.80. From a modeling perspective, I would continue to point out that our CS segment will have a heavier DoD tactical mix in the first half that has less margin opportunity than international programs. Interest expense will also remain elevated in the second quarter. Both trends should reverse as we make our way into the second half of the year, along with a second half-weighted free cash flow profile. Overall, a good start to 2024, and we remain focused on executing to deliver on commitments to our customers and our shareholders. \n With that, let's open the line for questions. Rob? Yes. No, from an LHX NeXt perspective, we are adjusting out the implementation costs of the program and certainly then trying to leverage the benefits of LHX NeXt in the businesses. We talked about what that target looked like for 2024, and the businesses are off working hard to operationalize that and reflect that benefit in their performance. And I think you're starting to see that here in the first quarter. And then from a cash perspective, we're primarily just adjusting out the cash severance costs related to the program. And you'll see all that reflected in the schedules to the earnings release. Yes. Gavin, it's Ken. I would say that we're seeing improvement in the kind of the high-level buckets across the board. I would say we're seeing some mix benefits in terms of, as Chris mentioned, kind of moving out of some of the development phase of contracts and into some of the more mature phase.\n From a mix perspective, we are seeing some of the areas of the business that are a higher mix of cost-plus growing. So as an example, space within SAS was a strong grower and has a bit of a higher cost-plus mix. So that kind of works the other way a little bit.\n But we are seeing some of the disciplined bidding start to come through in terms of confidence in our ability to perform as well as price discipline and then just performing on our programs and certainly LHX NeXt contributing. And I wouldn't want to put numbers on each of the individual buckets. But largely, as we think about kind of how you bridge from last year to this year for the most part, each of those major buckets are contributing. Sure. I'll take that one. So the first part of the question on CS margins. We delivered 24% margin in the first quarter, which I think was great performance by the CS team. And that does reflect a higher domestic mix than we saw late in '23 as well as a higher domestic mix than we expect to see in the second half of '24.\n We did guide low to mid 24% margin for CS for '24. And I think what we're trying to communicate is that we expect the domestic mix to be kind of consistent in the second quarter with the first quarter. Solid performance could yield similar results. But in driving that margin up to the low to mid 24% for the full year, we are looking at some international opportunities to realize some additional margin benefit as we think about that kind of full year impact. And I think -- so that's what we're trying to communicate on CS margins from a Q1 and full year '24 perspective.\n And then from the international side. Clearly, as Chris talked about in his prepared remarks and in response to Jason's question, a lot of international opportunity at certainly the CS segment. But as we look beyond that as well, we see international opportunity, in particular at IMS and certainly, the other segments have international components to their business. We don't necessarily track some of the ultimate end customer quite as closely in some of those. But the international margins tend to be stronger across the board.\n In my remarks, I talked about an ISR program by a NATO country. We would expect that would have strong margins as we, again, think about how we make those deliveries to our international allies and our country's partners, and recognizing the different risks and channels that come with those programs that should you perform, and we expect to be able to perform, will generate higher margins for the business. So we do see that continuing to move into the business.\n I will comment, CS clearly is the kind of the quickest-turn segment, the shorter-cycle segment in terms of ability to take international orders and turn it into sales. So just an example, that ISR program we talked about will be a multiyear program, and we'll see that kind of move into the revenue over a bit more time. But with that, I'll turn it to Chris for a few more comments. Yes. From a tactical radio perspective, I would say we're -- had a solid bookings order in the quarter. We've got a very solid backlog for that business at this point in time, looking at a multibillion dollar backlog in that business. And for a pretty quick turn, our shortest-cycle business, that is a very robust backlog at this point in time. So we're excited about the opportunities.\n I would say the Marine Corps and SOCOM opportunity is a great one as we continue to expand that partnership with that very important customer for the business. We were also down-selected for the Air Force Next Gen Survival Radio, which is a great opportunity for that business to expand into a new market as well.\n And then clearly, the supplemental as Chris mentioned, and the international opportunities, so I think a huge opportunity in terms of really strong backlog at the Tactical Communications business. And as Chris mentioned, a great business model that enables them to kind of turn that factory pretty quick to deliver the radios to appropriate customers as needed based on critical demand and critical needs on the battlefield.\n At IMS, in terms of -- I think the question was about EACs. And I would say that as we talked about in the prepared remarks, every segment performed better from a net EAC perspective. IMS was a part of that, significantly better performance than Q1 '23. IMS is our longest-cycle business, and it takes a while to kind of turn those programs and the operations and get everything working through the system. I think IMS had great performance in the first quarter at 11.4%, working towards the guidance that we put out there for IMS for full year '24.\n And strong performance on their programs, I think really starting to stabilize both the operations in terms of rates, realizing some of the benefits of LHX NeXt as well as all the hard work that the sectors within IMS segment are doing to deliver on their programs. So we're really excited about kind of the stabilization and the continued strong performance as we look out into the remaining quarters of '24. Yes. Thanks for the question, David. Appreciate it. I think you were breaking up a little bit, but I believe the question was about SAS performance in the quarter. And solid performance by the SAS team in the first quarter, 12.3% margin rate. And they are performing well on their programs. We talked a little bit about some of the drivers there, including maturing some of the development programs. And we also talked a little bit about the mix. And as space continues to grow, that's a little more cost-plus mix. That could temper a little bit of the margins in the last 3 quarters of the year.\n But we did update guidance for SAS to approximately 12% on the margin rate. They were 12.3% in the first quarter, some upside from EAC adjustments. And as we saw strong program performance, you've got to kind of book that in the quarter.\n You do -- it does result in a higher booking rate as you move forward, but you do pick up some cume catch adjustment that flows through in that 90-day period versus the full year impact where that gets tempered a little bit. But we're very confident in the team at SAS, and we're confident in the guide that we put out there for approximately 12%. And I know the SAS team is out there working hard as we speak to try to figure out how to drive that up from there. Yes. Chris, maybe I'll just add real quick on to that in terms of Armed Overwatch, so beyond biz jets at IMS. We did get a delivery order 3 on that program for 9 aircraft, I think, bringing the total order to 25. And to your comments, I think as that program matures, gives us greater confidence in the international opportunities for that aircraft. So looking to the building confidence on that one."

            "name": "Christopher Kubasik",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Since the merger of L3 and Harris 5 years ago and after strategic acquisitions and targeted divestitures, we have built a company with a national security focus. We have critical technologies in all domains that align to national security priorities and the global threat environment. Responsive space, resilient communications and rocket motors are critical for the future fight. The trusted disruptor strategy and our portfolio are setting the stage for L3Harris to differentiate ourselves with top line growth while simultaneously increasing our industry-leading margins. \n The global security environment continues to be one with heightened tensions and regional conflict. Domestically, Congress recently passed the 2024 Appropriations Bill, which included $844 billion for defense. Our programs are well funded, and we are positioned for profitable growth across much of the enterprise. Demand remains strong for our products and solutions as we started off the year with a 1.06x book-to-bill ratio.\n Internationally, we continue to see a strong and geographically diverse pipeline of opportunities. As an example, we were recently awarded a $150 million program to provide secure networking to Taiwan, displacing a long-time incumbent. This win is an integral part of our interoperability and supports the CJADC2 mission. \n Turning to tactical radios. We maintain a robust international pipeline of over $10 billion, including several FMS cases, primarily for Europe, totaling more than $1 billion. These opportunities, along with the continued strong backlog, give us confidence in an international tactical radio ramp in the second half of the year. Other international opportunities are supported by the DoD's supplemental funding, particularly in Ukraine. \n Earlier this week, the President signed a foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan that includes $67 billion in funding for key defense programs. L3Harris has been a key supplier in Ukraine since the start of the conflict, and the need for this equipment remains strong. \n Our products are being used in theater and exceeding expectations. The supplemental bill will provide our allies access to needed capabilities while at the same time support the U.S. defense industrial base, including small and midsized businesses. With the bill just recently passed, we will give you more information during the next earnings call on the incremental opportunities that it provides. Our workforce is proud to support our country and its allies around the globe. \n Turning to 2024. Our strong first quarter results reflect improvement across our diverse set of programs and products. We're executing on our contracts and improving cost and schedule performance, which helped drive net positive EACs for the second consecutive quarter. In our product businesses, we are improving quality and driving higher on-time deliveries. \n Turning to programs. I see development risk abating. This is not to say that we're out of the woods on all of our development programs, but the business is performing well and the disciplined bidding focus and programmatic rigor is starting to pay off. LHX NeXt cost savings are also starting to contribute, and we see that benefit accelerating in 2024 and 2025. \n Ken will cover the financials in more detail, but I wanted to highlight that revenue was up double-digit year-over-year and operating income was up $150 million, resulting in margins expanding 80 basis points to 15.1%. Given the strong start to the year, we are raising our 2024 margin EPS and revenue guidance while reaffirming our free cash flow commitments. \n At our Investor Day, we committed to $1 billion in LHX NeXt gross cost savings by 2026, focused on optimizing our workforce infrastructure and supply chain. The initiative will enable us to maintain our industry-leading margins while investing in technologies, tools and systems to support our customers and employees. We are accelerating our LHX NeXt activity in 2024. And earlier this month, we implemented a workforce reduction that will result in about 5% fewer people than when we began the year. With these reductions, we are focused on eliminating noncore processes, streamlining our organizational structure to maximize efficiency and rightsizing our physical footprint. \n To summarize. Our actions to date have put us ahead of our gross run rate savings target of $400 million by the end of the year. There's more work to do, and I am confident in our LHX NeXt leadership team and know that our collective efforts will yield the $1 billion savings target, as previously committed. \n Operationally, we continue to make progress within our Aerojet Rocketdyne segment. Since closing the acquisition, we've implemented processes and tools, which have helped reduce late deliveries by 20%. We've returned multiple programs back to green, and we continue to work with our customers and the DoD to accelerate and improve deliveries of these critical products and to support future growth. \n Aligned with that growth, it was recently announced that we were selected to be the primary propulsion provider for the Missile Defense Agency's next-generation interceptor. We anticipate this to be a multibillion-dollar opportunity over the life of the program. \n Outside of operations, our finance team saw an opportunity to refinance some variable rate debt and replace it with fixed rate notes, saving 150 basis points. On capital deployment. We increased our dividend for the 23rd consecutive year, and we were able to get back into the share repurchase market in Q1, executing about half of the 2024 share repurchase target. We expect about $1 billion in gross proceeds from the previously announced divestitures, which will largely be used to reduce our leverage below our 3.0 target ratio. \n We remain focused on achieving the financial framework we laid out at Investor Day, and our first quarter results are a solid step forward towards delivering on our commitments. \n I'll now turn it over to Ken to provide additional perspective. All right. Noah, thanks for the question. Yes, I think our strategy is working, as I said, and the portfolio is well aligned. Relative to the pie between the supplemental and the fiscal year '24 budget, we're well over $900 billion. So I think there's plenty of DoD funding. \n Relative to the new entrants, which sometimes I like to think of us as one since we're 5 years old, but I know where you're going with your question. We've taken the approach to team and work collaboratively with these new entrants at the highest level. So a lot of the new entrants tend to be a little more software-focused. I think the traditional, including ourselves, are a little more hardware-focused. So we're working collaboratively. \n There's been some recent awards in Q1 where we are actually a subcontractor to a new entrant that want a significant program. And sometimes, they work under us. So I would say we're embracing them and working collaboratively with them. And of course, I've talked about our Shield investments in the past and working with those venture capital companies who are much smaller but also have great technology. So I think it's working, and that's been our approach. Ken? Yes. Look, we've gotten the feedback relative to our disclosures. So under Ken's leadership, we're trying to cut back on these onetime non-GAAP adjustments and be much more transparent. So I think it will be all laid out clear for you to analyze. $23 billion and $26 billion? Yes, absolutely. No, NGI, which is designed to protect the U.S. against evolving long-range ballistic missile threats, is a huge win for the OEM. We were a merchant supplier, as I've talked about before, on both teams. So this definitely gives us a tailwind.\n When we looked -- I went back and looked at our deal model, this really was not factored in when we made the acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne. So from that perspective, it's going to be accretive, at least, to our own internal goals. Aerojet Rocketdyne is a great technology, especially with the large solid rocket motors. But the quantities are still to be determined. It's going to start as a development program.\n We're in discussions, obviously, with the Prime. We haven't actually been awarded and signed a contract yet. But as you saw in the media, we were selected as a propulsion provider. So it's very exciting. And again, I think it will be a slower ramp as you would imagine. But '25-'26 time frame, I think we'll start to see the revenue hit our financials. Yes, Kristine, it's Chris. We did set up the ad hoc Business Review Committee of the Board comprised of 4 Board members, as you saw. We've been meeting a couple of times a month for a few hours each. And we brought through a variety of topics that have been laid out in the charter that we filed in the 8-K.\n I would say from anything from operations, we've looked at the programs, they've reviewed the program review process, the bidding process, the LHX NeXt strategy and goals. They've reviewed the portfolio, our capital deployment strategy. And we're just kind of checking through the items in the charter. Some topics are one meeting, some topics are 2 meetings. I feel like we're about halfway through the process, maybe a little more.\n And then probably middle of the year or so, the BRC will report out to our Board of Directors with observations and recommendations and findings. So I'd say it's been a very collaborative process. I think it's been good for the company, and it's a good way to orient some new Board members quickly about the company and what we're trying to accomplish. So I'd say all is going well to this point. So more to come. Yes. No. Thanks, Peter. So yes, the workforce is probably the quick hitter for what we need to do for LHX NeXt. And as you said, that got us about 1/3 of the way there. The next part is going to be a little more timely and a little more complicated. And the facilities, I think, are going to be a key part of it.\n Looking at the infrastructure. We have a goal of getting from 275 facilities down to 200. We have about 7 or 8 that we've identified that we'll start the process here in the second quarter. So that will have a little bit of cost to move and relocate and consolidate, but these would be smaller entities that the business case is better to consolidate into a larger facility.\n We're continuing to reduce our ERP systems. We've invested in some technology called the unified data layer to get us access by laying on top of all of our systems to be able to get data more quickly. And then, of course, we talked about the initiatives in IT. Ultimately getting, believe it or not, from 98 data centers -- I'm sorry, 85 data centers down to 2. So that's the infrastructure. That's going to take some time, and that's why it's going to lead into 2025 and 2026.\n We've already kicked off with the indirect procurement. We've effectively outsourced that, taking advantage of the buying power of that enterprise. So that's both a combination of price and quantity. So we're tracking to that. And then ultimately, we called it the supply chain, but it's really beyond the supply chain. It's the integration of all the functions that are critical to our products with the overall goal of reducing the cost of our products. So there's an engineering component, there's clearly a supply chain component, contracting and such. So that process is ongoing, but that's where we're going to get the next $600 million or so of savings.\n To your question on portfolio shaping. As you know, we have 2 that are in process. I'll just give you an update there. The antenna business, which we announced, a couple of hundred million dollars that's tracking to close the middle of this year, second quarter to be specific. And then our commercial aviation is going to be more in the second half of the year. That'll give us the $1 billion of proceeds.\n Relative to the rest of the portfolio, we're just taking a hard look at that. We're going to be able to hit our leverage ratio based on these 2. And to the extent we can get a good price for what we've identified as noncore, we'll do it. But too many of the offers are coming in low, and people think we're desperate to sell, and I can assure you, we're not. So we need to get better valuations before we proceed on other transactions. Otherwise, we'll keep and run the business and go forward from there. Yes. Thanks, Jason. So let me start with Link 16. Again, we have a footprint on 20,000 platforms, and then there's variations of Link 16 and other data links that we've developed that are going to be able to go into those platforms or footprint. So I think we're starting to see that. Our ultimate goal was to get Link 16 into space.\n I can tell you for the SDA transport opportunities that are coming up, our team is going to be a merchant supplier. And as of now, it looks like we're going to be on all the teams providing Link 16-type capability and space. So we're excited about that.\n Relative to the Communication Systems, I want to reiterate the opportunity that we won in Taiwan, $150 million for networking, which was a cross-company win led by our Communications segment. So that's a big deal for us. And as I mentioned, it really supports the CJADC2 initiative that our country has been talking about for quite some time.\n Relative to the radios, I mean, this is just absolute good news. I know we've been talking about modernization, not only here in the U.S. but globally. And as I mentioned, we have 6 FMS cases that are currently going through the process, through the system in Europe. The backlog is going to be record backlog. Even in Q1, we were able to get the marine and the SOCOM radio orders booked.\n And there's a certain capacity and ability to deliver out of our Rochester facility, And it really comes, to be honest, how quickly we can get these supplemental funds under contract and approved and delivered. And with our trusted disruptor strategy, our business model actually allows us to potentially deliver radios within a week of getting the contract, depending on the configuration in the country.\n So the way I look at it, we have high confidence in the guidance we've given. We clearly have the second half ramp up. But which countries will get which radios will really be a factor of when the funding turns into a contract. And those that don't get signed and delivered in 2024 will clearly be 2025. So just feel better about the business in a huge way. And again, the products, our in-theater being tested daily, and they're working and exceeding expectation. And the whole focus on resilient communications is paying off. Yes, Ken. Just as a reminder, we're in the low 20% of our revenue comes from international customers, and part of our margin improvement strategy is to grow our international business. And just as a reminder, about half of that is foreign military sales, which has margins consistent with the DoD work for the most part, and the other half is direct commercial sale. And that's where we tend to have the higher margins. But as Ken said, more international is synonymous with higher margins, and that's where our focus is. These supplementals are a big step in the right direction. Yes, we can. Yes. Thanks, Richard. I think I've been pretty consistent on the -- on our bidding strategy. We talked about the bidding discipline. It's been referenced a few times. There's 2 things going on there. A lot of people in this industry sending an inordinate amount of time and money trying to focus on a price-to-win strategy and hiring outside consultants. And we kind of find that interesting but irrelevant, so we've taken a different approach. \n What is our labor? What is our supply chain? What is overhead? And what's a reasonable fee? We add that up, and that's the bid we put in. And if it's deemed too high, we move on. And if it's appropriate based on our past performance and capabilities, we book the order. So that's a little bit of a change here over the last year or so.\n But more importantly is bidding the right types of contracts. And I think in Stand-in Attack weapon, it was a fixed-price contract for development, again, with fixed priced options. And we will not bid any programs where we are asked to give a fixed price on an option for a product that's yet to be developed. It's just plain and simple common sense. I think there are some people in the department that agree with me, and maybe there are others that don't. But you see what happens. In most of these negative EACs across the industry, when you do a root cause corrective action, more times than not, it's a bad contracting vehicle. Nobody is perfect, and there are performance issues, but you cannot perform of a bad contract. And that's what we're trying to do, I guess, on next opportunities to prime.\n I mean we have -- and again, we take an approach where is the best approach, either be a merchant supplier or a subcontractor or a prime based on our capabilities and what the customer needs.\n There was an Armed Overwatch. We've been successful there. We just got the delivery order 3. So we're up to 25 aircraft already. HADES, which is a big opportunity for the Army. It's the High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System. It's basically up to 14 aircraft. We're bidding a global 6,500. This aligns clearly with our ISR and other capabilities. So that would be a big win for us. We have some maritime, undersea ranges where we've primed, and there's some follow-on opportunities, a bunch in classified space. I usually get a space question for now, but I'll just plug that we had no satellites in orbit at the date of merger. \n We launched 6 in the quarter, and we've been awarded 60 SATS as prime, and there's more in the pipeline. So those come to mind just off the top of my head. And of course, we have a lot of opportunities at Aerojet Rocketdyne. And those are follow-on, but those are not prime programs. So I guess, SDA. I was thinking SDA Tranche 3 for tracking. As you know, we're the only company to have been awarded Tranche 0, 1 and 2 for a total of 38 satellites. We should get an RFP in the fourth quarter for Tranche 3, and that could be another 18 satellites. So hope that helps, Richard. And I think second part of your question was F-35. Our production deliveries are tracking. We have a ramp coming up in production here starting next month. So we continue to have good relations with Lockheed. In fact, I was just talking to them yesterday. They'll be starting to deliver aircraft, as you know. They'll comment on that themselves. But as they start delivering aircraft, we're going to have to ramp up even further and quicker. And that's our plan. We've made the investments in most of the infrastructure we need. So continued improvement month-over-month, quarter-over-quarter. And it's all about the core processor, and that's where the focus of the team is. Yes. Thanks, Matt. I mean at IMS, we did get the NATO Electronic Attack Aircraft. And this -- we were thinking back on this not that long ago. I mean this is something about 8 years ago, 9 years ago. We talked about disrupting the market, and I always give the space example. But it feels like we pretty much invented and created this biz jet ISR market. We have over 50 biz jet orders in the last 8 or 9 years on 5 different platforms.\n So we have this one opportunity that I mentioned in Europe, NATO country. There's some longer-term opportunities kind of in the Mid East. These things take a year or 2 to get booked. So the biz jet market for electronic attack, ISR, whatever capabilities, are still out there. There's a huge opportunity in the Far East that we're on our third bid relative to being down-selected. So that could be a couple of billion dollars in 2025. So very excited about that.\n Armed Overwatch, we're starting to get interest from international customers. Once we start making deliveries later this year or early next year, I think that market is going to pick up from the aircraft side. And we still have some C130 capabilities that I believe have some international opportunities.\n Maritime, we're doing a lot of work with Australia. So we continue to see opportunities there as well. Viper Shield is actually out of SAS, but great capability on F-16 EW. So I see that growing as well. And then, of course, WESCAM with the turrets, that's just a high-growth market with opportunities pretty much all over the globe. Yes. Thanks, Sheila. We're being selective in where we invest and bid. And if I look at the different domains, I think space is a perfect example where we are absolutely taking a market share. And as I said earlier, we've been awarded 60 satellites as a prime just since the merger, including 38 for SDA tracking alone.\n And there's -- it's a hot market. But every couple of weeks or months, you can pick up a paper and see there's one less company in this market, a lot of [ SPACs ]. A lot of companies are withdrawing from that market. And we take that as a sign of our success. We're making money and we've disrupted the market. So I feel really good about what we've done in space.\n The airborne domain, I think it's really going to be more with -- what I referenced with the business jets. Maybe Armed Overwatch, to a lesser degree, where again, we're filling in gaps and replacing long-term incumbents are giving them different platforms, with better capability for the missions that they want.\n Our maritime work on the undersea ranges is world-class. Again, you go back 6 years, we had no work in that regard, and we found an opportunity to unseat a long-term 40-year incumbent and came up with a different solution. And it's been well received around the globe, as an example.\n We've talked historically about our torpedo launch and recovery system using unmanned undersea vehicles. That market is a hot market, in my opinion. We just have to get out there and get a couple of customers, and I think that could be a real game changer for our undersea business.\n On the radios. We talk about the radios, a lot of good work there. An exciting one that we haven't really talked much about is for the Air Force, which is the Next Gen Survival Radio. So we're 1 of 2 companies competing on that. And in a couple of years, we could be down-selected a new market. And another example, dislodging a long-term incumbent.\n And then, of course, innovation in cyber. There's something going on there every day, and you kind of have to innovate daily to stay ahead of the threat. And we're doing that and seeing good growth and good performance in that domain as well. So I hope that answers your question. Yes. Doug, great, great question. And yes, it was about 16 months ago when we announced this acquisition. And I think I agree with you. When I look at where we are now, the business case gets better and better. The demand, there was no conflict in Israel. People thought Ukraine would be done. Nobody anticipated a $900 billion of defense spending for 2024.\n So the tactical missiles, the nuclear deterrent, NGI, just tons of opportunities on SRMs. Over the long term, call it 5, 7 years, double-digit growth on the top line does not seem unreasonable to me. We have to, of course, invest in the capacity. The bottlenecks, some of them are based on low yields and performance and supply chain. I think we've made good progress in that regard, investing in our suppliers, getting additional suppliers.\n I continue to think the more money the government can give to the supply chain, the better off we are. I continue to believe we don't need an additional solid rocket motor prime. What we need is someone working on the igniters, the nozzles and the cases. And I think that would help unlock the potential.\n We've ordered equipment to continue to expand, whether it's mixers, ovens. They, unfortunately, tend to have a 50-, 60-week lead time, but we've placed those orders. And once we get that in, I think it's going to be -- help with the ramp. We have DPA money to build some buildings, take existing facilities and modify them. So the consolidation and [ piece ] dividend and Budget Control Act for a decade kind of stifle the ability for companies to invest and grow and inconsistent demand signals.\n But right now, I think everything is a potential tailwind. And we'll have the factories digitized by the end of this year, and we're making the investments and fixing the processes. So pretty excited about it. And 2024 is kind of catch up and continue to burn down the delinquent backlog and simultaneously invest and put in processes. But I think by the time we get to 2026, 2027, if all stays as is, it's going to really turn out to be a great acquisition.\n So I appreciate the question, Doug. And let me just wrap it up. And first of all, thank the workforce and the leadership team for a great first quarter. Obviously, thank you all for joining the call today. And Ken, Mark, myself and the team will be engaging with many of you in person in the months to come. \n So thank you all, and have a great weekend."
