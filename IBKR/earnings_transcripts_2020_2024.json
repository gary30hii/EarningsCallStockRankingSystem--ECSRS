At this time, all participants' lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Nancy Stuebe, Director of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us for our year-end 2020 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call and will handle the Q&A, but asked me to present the rest of his comments. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which, by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports, filed with the SEC. 2020 was a year of unprecedented worldwide investor engagement with the markets, and Interactive Brokers capturing a large piece of it. We ended the year with a record 1,073,000 accounts, up 56% over last year. In 2020, we opened over 383,000 net new accounts, three times that of our previous record. Client equity grew 66% to $289 billion. Trading activity continued strong all year, with active customer trading levels. Total DARTs began to increase last January and doubled over the course of the year to 2.1 million per day. Per account, DARTs rose from 266 last year to 459 this year. Growth came from a broad range of geographies and customer types, from our geographically diverse sales team and from strong word of mouth. In many countries, we have now grown to a large enough size in terms of accounts that word of mouth leads to meaningful growth from the clients who use and recommend us to their friends and colleagues. As more people want to participate in the markets, invest globally and diversify their holdings, they look to their more experienced friends who have found at Interactive Brokers the access and variety of securities they are looking for. They then see what we offer and sign up. In many regions, this global access can often be found nowhere else or, if it can be found, comes only at an unreasonably high price. While accounts in the United States have doubled since 2015, outside the U.S., they are up more than four times, meaning we are less dependent on the U.S. or in any one country for our future. The U.S. now accounts for 26% of our total accounts, down from nearly half five years ago. Challenges met this year, include the impact of the COVID pandemic on our clients and staff, the impact of a cash settled contract closing at a negative price, the effect of Brexit on our European business and the conclusion of our ongoing conversations with regulators. Regarding COVID, while it has led to a resurgence of interest in the market, as people at home look for something constructive to do, it has also meant the majority of our staff works from home. As a technology company, we are uniquely well positioned to handle this and have not seen interruptions or issues in our business because of it. I'm happy to say, that thanks to tremendous effort on the part of regulators and our team in Europe, we received our approvals before the Brexit deadline, and have been able to migrate accounts to our new operations in Luxembourg, Hungary and Ireland. We are looking forward to working in these countries and expanding our European business further. On WTI, we have spoken about it on previous calls. We are completing programming for negative prices in all product categories in case this or similar first ever event occurs again. We have spent a great deal of time and effort coordinating with multiple regulators, including the CFTC, SEC, and FINRA and working with consultants to make sure our solutions and protocols are satisfactory. We have hired the necessary people and put most of these changes into place as we work on the last remaining items. The costs associated with this, which were spread over several quarters, should now start to ease, while the cost of compliance with regulatory regimes in Hong Kong, Australia, Canada, and the EU are now picking up. Our commissions were up 71% in the fourth quarter and up 58% for the year to $1.1 billion. Despite zero interest rates around the globe and the introduction of zero commissions in late 2019, our total net revenues for the fourth quarter were up 20% and for the year, up 15% to $2.2 billion. Our pretax margins were also strong at 65% for the fourth quarter and 57% for the year. Excluding non-core items, pretax margins were 65% for the fourth quarter and 61% for the year. There is no other broker we know of who comes close to our levels of profitability and we achieved these margins while offering state-of-the-art technology and global access. Now, I will go over our five client segments. Individual customers were the clear stars in 2020, posting the strongest account growth of all our client segments, up 77%, with 71% growth in client equity and 69% growth in annual commissions. Individuals now make up 57% of our accounts, 36% of our client equity and 54% of our annual commissions. All geographic regions in this segment experienced significant growth, particularly in Europe and Asia. We continue to see investor demand for global access and wide product choice with the global pandemic and more time at home, acting as tailwinds, encouraging investors large and small, that this is an opportune moment to enter the markets. While we call this segment individual, it incorporates a wide range of clients from new smaller investors buying their first stocks to larger and more sophisticated ones, trading equities and derivatives multiple times a day in several countries. Our platform can serve all of them and help them to achieve better returns by minimizing their costs. Introducing brokers was our next fastest-growing segment, with account growth of 42% and client equity growth of 115% and 12-month commission growth of 121%, introducing brokers are now 29% of our accounts, 30% of our client equity, and 13% of our commissions. As with Individuals, introducing brokers were strong in all geographic areas, particularly in Europe and especially in Asia, with similar tailwinds to individuals, the desire by investors to open accounts, especially internationally, and to participate in the market. These accounts are basically also individual accounts with a broker between IBKR and the individual account holder. In exchange for a smaller commission, we can pass on to the broker, the direct communication with the customer and of course, it is the broker who recruits the customer. Small, mid-sized, and start-up brokers continue to find it difficult to build and maintain complex technology involved in offering the global access and product offerings their customers want. So, they come to us to white brand our state-of-the-art technology and capitalize on our low cost. As competitive pressures increased and as agencies in various countries increase their compliance oversight of the financial services industry, complexity rises over time, encouraging more brokers to come to or to start up with us. Hedge funds constitute 1% of our account, 7% of client equity, and 7% of our annual commissions. In 2020, we saw a growth from hedge funds of 2% in accounts, 34% in client equity, and 21% in 12-month commissions. We achieved this growth despite the hedge fund industry overall experiencing a third consecutive year of fund outflows. Hedge funds remain a large multi-trillion dollar global market, and we continue to have room to grow in this area. Proprietary trading firms are 2% of our accounts, 9% of client equity, and 14% of yearly commissions. For the year, this group grew 28% in accounts, 44% in client equity, and 43% in commissions. Despite already being well-penetrated in this segment, our continued growth here means that our platform demonstrates value and appeal for sophisticated traders and their larger accounts. Finally, we have financial advisers. They are 12% of our accounts, 17% of our customer equity, and 12% of annual commissions. Accounts in this group grew by 17%, client equity by 28%, and commissions by 18%. Several factors will continue to drive this business. Our Greenwich Compliance Group, which provides registration and compliance assistance for new and existing RIAs, continues to sign up RIAs who want to open their own businesses or move from an existing clearing firm. Going independent means RIAs can keep all the fees they earn. As more advisors look to become independent, our low commission and financing rates, wide variety of mutual fund families offered and the availability of Greenwich Compliance's service contribute to growth in this segment. Second, with consolidation among our competitors, many advisors do not want to compete for clients with their clearing firm or be subject to the hidden fees that always seem to pop-up. We welcome all of them with transparent pricing, no competing products or in-house advisors, free portfolio performance reporting, a free CRM and global market access. Although, we do not yet feel in growing numbers of advisors, our sales force is getting a large number of inquiries from advisors looking for a new platform and from advisors hoping to become independent in the near future. There is a great deal that we are looking forward to in 2021. We have recently rolled out and will continue to broaden our impact dashboard. The dashboard allows our clients to select the ESG criteria most important to them, so they can identify and invest in those companies that share their values. It also analyzes clients' portfolios and calculate an overall score to see how well their portfolios align with the values most important to them. We are also excited about our mutual fund marketplace, which offers 37,000 funds, all with no custody fee to our clients around the world. Because we do not offer our own funds, we do not compete against our clients. To close, when we started our brokerage business in 1993, we thought a good goal to have, one that would motivate us, but seem like a distant target far in the future would be to achieve 100,000 accounts on our platform. We reached that in 2008, 15 years later. We thought again about what an achievable but distant goal would be and came up with one million accounts. I'm happy to say we achieved that goal in October, 12 years later. Our goal now is 80 million accounts or 1% of world population. How long will that take? We are not sure, but think 10 to 15 years. It is encouraging that there is one country today, which I'm not going to name, where we have accounts from over 1% of its population. This is a high target. Similar to our earlier goal, it is a ways away, but can be achieved. If we continue to automate and attract customers by giving them the tools, low pricing and global product access they need to succeed.  With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul?\nPaul Brody: Thank you, Nancy. Thanks everybody for joining the call. As usual, I'll review our fourth quarter and then the full year results main factors that drove those numbers and then we'll open it up for questions. On the whole for the year, the pandemic and actions by the Federal Reserve, which stirred up the markets and reduced U.S. interest rates near zero, produced a substantial shift in the components of our revenue. Strong gains in commissions bolstered by a flood of new customer accounts more than made up for the drop in net interest income. Comparing the fourth quarter to the prior year, the contributions to net revenues of commissions and net interest income changed from 34% and 57% to 48% and 38%. The combination together with other revenue streams produced a 20% year-over-year increase in quarterly net revenues and record annual pre-tax income.  Turning to operating data. Trading volumes and customer account openings continued at the high levels we've seen throughout the year, leading to strong growth in accounts, client equity, client credit balances, margin lending and securities lending. Total accounts grew to about $1.1 million, up 56% year-over-year, contributing to client equity growth of 66%. We saw growth in all customer segments and in particular, in individuals and introducing brokers. Market volatility though higher than last year was the lowest this quarter for 2020. As measured by the average mix, volatility rose to 25.7% in the fourth quarter, up 83% year-over-year, but down from its second quarter 2020 peak of nearly 35%. However, the band between this quarter's low and high vex of 20% and 40% was wider than in the third quarter and wider than any quarter last year. This contributed to strong trading volumes and a 71% increase in commissions.  Despite continued low or negative interest rates worldwide, our net interest income fell only 22% versus the fourth quarter of '19, thanks to strength in customer cash balances, margin lending and securities lending. 56% account growth provided a tailwind due to strong volumes in all product categories. Customer contract and share volumes in options, futures and stocks grew 76%, 22% and 215% respectively for the fourth quarter and 67%, 30% and 97% respectively for the year.  Our volumes outpaced overall industry volumes in the U. S., which were up in nearly all categories and FX dollar volumes rose as well. DARTs reached a record of $2.1 million more than 2.5 times to $797,000 of the fourth quarter last year. Our average cleared commission for DART was down 32% to $2.46 for several reasons: First, more trading and equities relative to derivatives. Derivatives are more expensive, though not necessarily more profitable due to relatively high exchange fees. Second, higher volumes of IBKR orders that added liquidity were routed to exchanges, generating more rebates from the exchanges. These are passed on in a form of reduced commissions to customers choosing tiered commission. And third, smaller average trade side. Results for the full year reflected the continued momentum and operational leverage of our core brokerage business. Full year commissions rose 58% on high volatility in volumes. Net interest income fell 19% with the impact of near zero interest rates, partially offset by higher customer cash and margin loan balances, as well as strong securities lending. Higher volumes were seen in all product categories, surpassing general overall industry volume trends. For the full year, total DARTs rose 115% and average commission per DART fell 24% for the reasons I pointed to earlier. The net interest margin table shows that our net interest margin tightened in the fourth quarter to 1.04%, down from 1.70% in the year ago period. For the year, net interest margin was 1.07%, down from 1.70% last year, despite the drop in U.S. benchmark rates to near zero, higher-margin loan balances, a strong securities lending performance and some positive contribution to customer credit balanced interest from those currencies with negative rate kept the NIM from falling further. The Federal Reserve lowered rates to a target range of 0 to 25 basis points in the first quarter and has kept them there since. Internationally, rates are near zero or negative in nearly every country in which we do business. During the year, we kept a relatively short duration on our U.S. treasury portfolio. In the low rate environment, we recorded a mark-to-market loss of $4.5 million for the year, including a nominal loss in the fourth quarter. As always, we plan to hold these securities to maturities, so these gains and losses are temporary. But as brokers unlike banks, GAAP rules require us to mark these securities to market in our financial reporting. This is one of our non-GAAP items that we consider to be non-core. Outside the U.S., interest rates were predominantly zero to negative. We recorded positive interest on certain customer cash balances, where we pass through negative rate costs on these currents. For rate increases that may occur in the future, note that about 25% of our customer credit balances are not in U.S. dollars. So changes in U.S rates will not impact all of these balances. Despite higher customer cash balances, segregated cash interest income fell due to the collapse in rates and a persistently flat yield curve. Average margin loan balances rose 19% and finished the year 26% over the year ago quarter, as investors displayed an increased appetite for risk. Our growth reflects our ability to fulfill the needs of larger customers as opportunities arise. So despite our narrow spread over benchmark rates on margin loans, we continue to experience some spread compression in this low rate environment. We consider our low-margin rates, a significant factor in attracting investors to interact with brokers. Securities lending interest income was up 44% this quarter and 33% for the full year. Our automation allows us to optimize the availability of customer positions to lend hard to borrow high rate securities and customer short stock value, which rose 6% from the prior year end is largely covered by customer margin stocks, reducing our need to borrow from external counterparties. Now, for our estimates of the impact of the next 25 basis point increase in rates, when calculating the impact of rate changes, we understand that as the possibility of a future rate increase becomes more certain, this expectation is typically already reflected in the yields of the instruments in which we invest. Therefore, we attempt to isolate the impact of an unexpected rise or fall in rates, separate from the impact of rate hikes or cuts that have already been baked into the prices of these instruments. With that assumption, we would expect the next 25 basis point on anticipated rise in rates to produce an additional $98 million in net interest income over the next four quarters and $103 million as the yearly run rate based on our current balance sheet. These numbers are highly sensitive to benchmark rate changes due to the impact of low rates on the spread between what we earn on our segregated cash and what we pay to our customers. When U.S. rates fell below 50 basis points, our spread compressed as we're able to earn less when investing our segregated cash. However, the converse is also true that as rates move back up towards 50 basis points, our spread expands significantly. The yearly run rate includes the reinvestment of all of our present holdings at the new assumed rate, but does not take into account any change in how we manage our segregated cash. If we're successful in continuing to grow our customer assets, higher cash and margin lending balances will offset some of the loss of net interest income from low benchmark rates. Turning to our income statement, as a reminder, one year ago, we began reporting our consolidated numbers only and we no longer report segment. We define non-core items as those not part of our fundamental operating results. Non-core items included four items this quarter. First, our currency diversification strategy produced a loss of $13 million versus a $12 million gain last year. Second, the nominal mark-to-market loss on U.S. government securities of $300,000 versus $1 million in the prior year. Third, a gain on our investments of $33 million versus a loss of $15 million last year; and fourth, tax and related adjustments netting to a $10 million addition to net income at public company level. The net effect of these adjustments raised net income by $11 million this quarter versus decreasing it by $600,000 last year. Net revenues were reported $599 million for the quarter, up 20% versus last year's fourth quarter. And excluding non-core items, net revenues were $582 million, up 16% versus last year. Commission revenue rose 71% to $288 million on significantly higher trade volumes in all product categories. Net interest income fell 22% to $225 million, though it was up sequentially. The decline was predominantly due to the drop in global interest rates to near zero and below. Other fees and services revenues rose 44% to $52 million. These include market data, exposure and account activity fees as well as fees generated from facilitating customers' participation in IPO. Other income, a more variable category that includes gains and losses on our investments and currency strategy as well as principal transactions was $34 million versus $9 million in the fourth quarter last year. Ex non-core items, other income increased to $17 million from $12 million a year ago. Non-interest expenses were $207 million for the quarter, up 10% from last year due primarily to higher execution and clearing costs on stronger trade volumes and higher employee compensation and benefits costs. Execution and clearing expense did not grow as rapidly as trade volume for several reasons, including the mix of products traded as well as the higher amount of rebates paid by exchanges when IBKR orders routed there at liquidity. Note that these rebates partially offset commission revenues, which reduces the average commission per DART. Employee compensation and benefits costs rose 15% and occupancy and communications expenses both grew $1 million as we expanded our presence in Europe. At quarter end, our total headcount stood at 2,033, a 24% increase over last year as we expanded to service significantly more customers, staff our new European offices and further strengthen our compliance functions. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of our employees worldwide have been working remotely. After a brief pause in the first quarter, we hired throughout the remainder of 2020, primarily in client services, appliance and systems development. Fixed expenses, which are non-interest expenses less the variable cost of execution and clearing fees were $141 million, up 8%, driven by higher compensation and benefits as well as some increase in occupancy and communications. G&A expenses were down 6% on the year ago quarter and 19% sequentially, primarily due to the non-recurrence of legal and related costs. The sequential decrease reflects the drop in expenses associated with the development of our enhanced global compliance program, which while still elevated, began to roll-off. Customer bad debt expense was immaterial this quarter. For the year, this expense was $13 million, well within our typical $0 million to $5 million per quarter range. Reported pretax income was $392 million, up 26%, despite a $62 million drop in net interest income for a 65% margin. Excluding non-core items, pre-tax income was $375 million, up 19% for a 64% margin. Diluted earnings per share were $0.81 for the quarter versus $0.57 in the year ago quarter. In ex non-core items, diluted earnings per share were $0.69 versus $0.58 for 2019. And for the full year, diluted earnings per share were $2.42 versus $2.10 last year and $2.49 versus $2.27 last year as adjusted. To help investors better understand how our earnings and taxes are split between public shareholders and non-controlling interest, the fourth quarter numbers are as follow; starting with our unadjusted pre-tax income of $392 million, we add back $4 million of standalone net expense at the public company to get the operating company's pre-tax income. We then deduct $4 million for income taxes paid by our operating company, which are mostly for intact. This leaves $392 million, of which 79.1% or that $309 million reported on our income statement is attributable to non-controlling interest. The remaining 20.9% or $83 million is available for the public company shareholders. As this is a non-GAAP measure, it is not reported on our income statement. After we deduct the $4 million public company standalone net expense and after expensing remaining taxes of $8 million owed on that $83 million, the public company's net income available for common stockholders is the $71 million you see reported on our income statement. Income tax expense line of $12 million consists of this $8 million plus the $4 million of taxes paid by the operating company. And one additional note on income tax, the current quarter's tax includes about $11 million in prior period adjustment benefits that are not expected to be recurring, including an approximately $8 million net benefit related to the revaluation of our deferred tax asset, which is included in our non-GAAP results. Turning to the balance sheet with $9 billion in consolidated equity at December 31, 2020, we are well capitalized from a regulatory standpoint. We deploy our strong capital base toward opportunities to grow our business and investing opportunities worldwide as well as to emphasize the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners. Our capital is deployed across 14 registered broker-dealer type entities around the world, supporting regulatory capital requirements, liquidity needs, margin lending and other financing opportunities in our growing brokerage business. And we continue to carry no long-term debt. With that, I will turn the call back over to the moderator, and we'll be happy to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nRich Repetto: Hey, good evening, Thomas and good evening, Paul, congrats on the strong quarter. And I'm just trying to see whether, on expenses, when you look to the forward year to 2021, are we still going to invest -- I think the guidelines has been somewhere around 15%. What's your view on expenses for the coming year, I guess, Thomas and Paul?\nThomas Peterffy: We probably increase expenses at least by 15% as we're trying to build out the new entities and of course, continue to build our customer service, our compliance departments and our ability to create new software. It's all about growing the company.\nRich Repetto: I understand. Another -- your margin balances went up pretty robustly in December and that's sort of a seasonal pattern. But irregardless you rebounded the margins -- rebounded dramatically from March when it hit $19 billion. But I guess it's still -- when you look at the average margin balance per account or margin balances as a percentage of overall client equity, there's still at relatively lows. And I'm just trying to see, Thomas, whether you are -- how optimistic that you think that these new -- all the new accounts will ultimately lever up and have similar margin balances that you've experienced in the years past? Because all the other metrics as far as trading, client equity, they're in line. It's not like you get a different account, it doesn't appear.\nThomas Peterffy: That's why I'm\u2026\nRich Repetto: But it\u2019s just\u2026\nThomas Peterffy: That's why I'm tearing my hair out. I'm mystified by the margin that is not increasing. What else can we do, but being by far the lowest offering, by far the lowest margin rate. And it's not that our current customers don't borrow more. I'm questioning why people who are out there at all these other brokers paying 3%, 4%, 5%, why they don't come over. So -- \nRich Repetto: You got me on that.\nThomas Peterffy: Yes.\nRich Repetto: Okay. Sorry.\nThomas Peterffy: I don't know the answer.\nRich Repetto: Okay. One last quick one, the diluted share count went up quarter by, I think, almost 10 million or so. And I know that's more than just you selling. I know there's no economic impact, but could you give us some color on what's happening there?\nThomas Peterffy: Some of our other internal shareholders have sold shares, unfortunately, too early.\nRich Repetto: Yes. Exactly.\nThomas Peterffy: Yes. Right.\nRich Repetto: Okay. Thank you very much, Thomas.\nThomas Peterffy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good evening, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I just want to learn how your three brokers in the European Union were running, including the new entity in Hungary and the recently approved broker in Ireland? And I wanted to see if they were now handling all the trades for EU clients that were able to be transitioned from the London broker?\nThomas Peterffy: So, that we are in the midst of transitioning these accounts. They have not all been transitioned, but most of them have been. And, yes, so that is the plan. By the end of the month that will be completed. And the plan is to, yes, handle all the EU clients from Ireland, Luxembourg and Budapest.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Got it. And then how much capacity is there for future growth in the EU, because I think your Luxembourg entity may be somewhat constrained, but I think there's actually probably a lot of upside for growth in the Irish entity?\nThomas Peterffy: There's a lot of upside in Ireland and in Central Europe, and that's exactly why we put in those two entities. We don't see anything.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Okay, great.\nThomas Peterffy: Okay.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Got it. Thomas, thank you for taking my questions.\nThomas Peterffy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of from the line of Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nWill Nance: Hi, guys. Good afternoon. I think most of my questions have already been asked. I did have one or two. Just a quick housekeeping one on the same cash yields. I think you hit 6 basis points this quarter, is that a fairly decent run rate, kind of, fully re-priced for the current rate environment. And then related to that, you mentioned keeping the duration short, I know there's been some steepening of the curve, although, I wouldn't exactly call it compelling and I think shorter-dated treasuries are still fairly flat. So, when we think about the ability to kind of extend the duration on the segregated cash portfolio like how much steepening do you kind of need to see for that to actually become worth the time and duration?\nThomas Peterffy: I would be much too scared to extend the duration, because I think inflation must be lurking in the bushes. I guess I can't understand how we can issue trillions of dollars of new money every other month and not feel the inflation. I don't understand what goes on. It can\u2019t go on like this forever.\nWill Nance: Got it. Okay. And then just maybe a follow-up on Rich's question on the margin balances. Just you guys do typically see a bit more year-end seasonality on margin balances than I think others. And some of the industry data points are pointing to really strong numbers in January and kind of retail trading continuing to be very robust. Just are you seeing that to kind of continue to flow through on margin balances month-to-date? And any color on whether you've seen the same sort of trends in trading activity?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, you have to excuse us. We do not talk about events past the year end.\nWill Nance: Got it. No worries. I thought I'd try.\nThomas Peterffy: Right.\nWill Nance: Thank you for taking my questions.\nThomas Peterffy: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is now open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi. Good evening. Thomas, trading activity was up 160% year-on-year in the fourth quarter. Just wondering if you could help frame how much of that increase is being driven by clients that were acquired in 2020 versus clients that were already on the platform previously. Just trying to get a sense of how much of that activity is really driven by these new clients that have recently joined?\nThomas Peterffy: So, the new clients trade a little bit less, but not by much. That's the answer. So, a new client -- \nKyle Voigt: Okay.\nThomas Peterffy: \u2026the new clients probably trade around 80% to 85% as much as the old ones.\nKyle Voigt: Okay, that's helpful. And you mentioned really strong growth in Europe and Asia, any more color on which countries you're seeing especially strong trends within that?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, surprisingly, Canada is one of the strongest. But in Europe, it's mostly Eastern Europe and Asia; it's the same old, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the surrounding countries.\nKyle Voigt: That's helpful. Thank you.\nThomas Peterffy: It's substantially diminished from China, probably because of the difficulty of getting money out.\nKyle Voigt: Got it. Right. And then also just a question on, I think, IBKR notes launched in the quarter for credited investors. Just wondering if you could just describe that program in more detail? I'm just wondering what you're earning on cash that's -- on client cash that's invested into that program? Is there a fee or security taking on that?\nThomas Peterffy: Paul, could you address this question?\nPaul Brody: Yes. Sure. For us, it's opportunistic when we get opportunities to place money at higher rates we do. The notes program gives us some flexibility after using what is otherwise house capital. It's a relatively short-term, relatively high rate to the investor. It started at 50 basis points, and then we ratcheted up to 1%. And they can roll over, in other words, we can redeem them at any time if we feel that the opportunities are no longer there or temporarily no longer there. So, it seems to be a very good program for us so far, and it got some pretty good take up from the start.\nKyle Voigt: Any way to quantify that at all, Paul, sorry?\nPaul Brody: The note\u2026\nKyle Voigt: No, sorry, in terms of the take-up thus far?\nPaul Brody: I think we were at $90-something million by the end of the year.\nKyle Voigt: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is now open.\nChris Allen: Good evening, everyone. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just wonder if maybe you could give us some color on other fees and services, saw a very nice year-over-year growth, sequential growth, whether that's being driven by market data, payment for order flow or other factors?\nThomas Peterffy: So, it's mostly market data. It's exposure fees that we charge to customers who's basically P&L profile can violate certain limits that we like to put on, because we basically -- we're not looking to expand -- we're not looking to collect on the exposure fees, but our real purpose is to try to get the client to rain in the risk in their position. But, nevertheless, it contributes to our income. But on the long run, we feel that we will pay that out in losses that the customers will not be able to make good. What other item is there, Paul? The payment for order flow comes from the IBKR Lite accounts, right, where we -- yeah.\nPaul Brody: No. The payments for that go into other fees and services are actually the exchange mandated programs and options exchanges where they rebate part of the liquidity producing orders. To the extent to the payment for order flow on the IBKR Lite actually nets into the commission. That's accounting convention, but it's clear how that comes out. And I was going to mention that in market data, although it's the largest item in that category, it's primarily a pass-through, right? We pay for market data, and then we collect on market data and we make a small spread on.\nChris Allen: Got it. And then, any material change in terms of how many accounts and trades IBKR might account for this quarter versus in the prior quarters?\nThomas Peterffy: Can you say that again?\nChris Allen: I'm just wondering, IBKR Lite percentage of trades and accounts, I think, it was running about 5% of accounts, and cash on the trade in the prior quarter?\nThomas Peterffy: It's fairly stable around those numbers. Although not that we are integrating with the folio customers, some 60,000 customers that are coming over, we're putting them all into IBKR Lite, so -- and leave it up to them if they want to switch to Pro. So you will see the proportion of live customers shut up by the end of the month.\nChris Allen: Got it. Thank you. That\u2019s it for me.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I would now turn the call back to Nancy Stuebe for closing remarks.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you everyone for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website and we'll be putting up a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again and we will talk to you next quarter end.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us for our year-end 2020 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call and will handle the Q&A, but asked me to present the rest of his comments. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which, by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports, filed with the SEC. 2020 was a year of unprecedented worldwide investor engagement with the markets, and Interactive Brokers capturing a large piece of it. We ended the year with a record 1,073,000 accounts, up 56% over last year. In 2020, we opened over 383,000 net new accounts, three times that of our previous record. Client equity grew 66% to $289 billion. Trading activity continued strong all year, with active customer trading levels. Total DARTs began to increase last January and doubled over the course of the year to 2.1 million per day. Per account, DARTs rose from 266 last year to 459 this year. Growth came from a broad range of geographies and customer types, from our geographically diverse sales team and from strong word of mouth. In many countries, we have now grown to a large enough size in terms of accounts that word of mouth leads to meaningful growth from the clients who use and recommend us to their friends and colleagues. As more people want to participate in the markets, invest globally and diversify their holdings, they look to their more experienced friends who have found at Interactive Brokers the access and variety of securities they are looking for. They then see what we offer and sign up. In many regions, this global access can often be found nowhere else or, if it can be found, comes only at an unreasonably high price. While accounts in the United States have doubled since 2015, outside the U.S., they are up more than four times, meaning we are less dependent on the U.S. or in any one country for our future. The U.S. now accounts for 26% of our total accounts, down from nearly half five years ago. Challenges met this year, include the impact of the COVID pandemic on our clients and staff, the impact of a cash settled contract closing at a negative price, the effect of Brexit on our European business and the conclusion of our ongoing conversations with regulators. Regarding COVID, while it has led to a resurgence of interest in the market, as people at home look for something constructive to do, it has also meant the majority of our staff works from home. As a technology company, we are uniquely well positioned to handle this and have not seen interruptions or issues in our business because of it. I'm happy to say, that thanks to tremendous effort on the part of regulators and our team in Europe, we received our approvals before the Brexit deadline, and have been able to migrate accounts to our new operations in Luxembourg, Hungary and Ireland. We are looking forward to working in these countries and expanding our European business further. On WTI, we have spoken about it on previous calls. We are completing programming for negative prices in all product categories in case this or similar first ever event occurs again. We have spent a great deal of time and effort coordinating with multiple regulators, including the CFTC, SEC, and FINRA and working with consultants to make sure our solutions and protocols are satisfactory. We have hired the necessary people and put most of these changes into place as we work on the last remaining items. The costs associated with this, which were spread over several quarters, should now start to ease, while the cost of compliance with regulatory regimes in Hong Kong, Australia, Canada, and the EU are now picking up. Our commissions were up 71% in the fourth quarter and up 58% for the year to $1.1 billion. Despite zero interest rates around the globe and the introduction of zero commissions in late 2019, our total net revenues for the fourth quarter were up 20% and for the year, up 15% to $2.2 billion. Our pretax margins were also strong at 65% for the fourth quarter and 57% for the year. Excluding non-core items, pretax margins were 65% for the fourth quarter and 61% for the year. There is no other broker we know of who comes close to our levels of profitability and we achieved these margins while offering state-of-the-art technology and global access. Now, I will go over our five client segments. Individual customers were the clear stars in 2020, posting the strongest account growth of all our client segments, up 77%, with 71% growth in client equity and 69% growth in annual commissions. Individuals now make up 57% of our accounts, 36% of our client equity and 54% of our annual commissions. All geographic regions in this segment experienced significant growth, particularly in Europe and Asia. We continue to see investor demand for global access and wide product choice with the global pandemic and more time at home, acting as tailwinds, encouraging investors large and small, that this is an opportune moment to enter the markets. While we call this segment individual, it incorporates a wide range of clients from new smaller investors buying their first stocks to larger and more sophisticated ones, trading equities and derivatives multiple times a day in several countries. Our platform can serve all of them and help them to achieve better returns by minimizing their costs. Introducing brokers was our next fastest-growing segment, with account growth of 42% and client equity growth of 115% and 12-month commission growth of 121%, introducing brokers are now 29% of our accounts, 30% of our client equity, and 13% of our commissions. As with Individuals, introducing brokers were strong in all geographic areas, particularly in Europe and especially in Asia, with similar tailwinds to individuals, the desire by investors to open accounts, especially internationally, and to participate in the market. These accounts are basically also individual accounts with a broker between IBKR and the individual account holder. In exchange for a smaller commission, we can pass on to the broker, the direct communication with the customer and of course, it is the broker who recruits the customer. Small, mid-sized, and start-up brokers continue to find it difficult to build and maintain complex technology involved in offering the global access and product offerings their customers want. So, they come to us to white brand our state-of-the-art technology and capitalize on our low cost. As competitive pressures increased and as agencies in various countries increase their compliance oversight of the financial services industry, complexity rises over time, encouraging more brokers to come to or to start up with us. Hedge funds constitute 1% of our account, 7% of client equity, and 7% of our annual commissions. In 2020, we saw a growth from hedge funds of 2% in accounts, 34% in client equity, and 21% in 12-month commissions. We achieved this growth despite the hedge fund industry overall experiencing a third consecutive year of fund outflows. Hedge funds remain a large multi-trillion dollar global market, and we continue to have room to grow in this area. Proprietary trading firms are 2% of our accounts, 9% of client equity, and 14% of yearly commissions. For the year, this group grew 28% in accounts, 44% in client equity, and 43% in commissions. Despite already being well-penetrated in this segment, our continued growth here means that our platform demonstrates value and appeal for sophisticated traders and their larger accounts. Finally, we have financial advisers. They are 12% of our accounts, 17% of our customer equity, and 12% of annual commissions. Accounts in this group grew by 17%, client equity by 28%, and commissions by 18%. Several factors will continue to drive this business. Our Greenwich Compliance Group, which provides registration and compliance assistance for new and existing RIAs, continues to sign up RIAs who want to open their own businesses or move from an existing clearing firm. Going independent means RIAs can keep all the fees they earn. As more advisors look to become independent, our low commission and financing rates, wide variety of mutual fund families offered and the availability of Greenwich Compliance's service contribute to growth in this segment. Second, with consolidation among our competitors, many advisors do not want to compete for clients with their clearing firm or be subject to the hidden fees that always seem to pop-up. We welcome all of them with transparent pricing, no competing products or in-house advisors, free portfolio performance reporting, a free CRM and global market access. Although, we do not yet feel in growing numbers of advisors, our sales force is getting a large number of inquiries from advisors looking for a new platform and from advisors hoping to become independent in the near future. There is a great deal that we are looking forward to in 2021. We have recently rolled out and will continue to broaden our impact dashboard. The dashboard allows our clients to select the ESG criteria most important to them, so they can identify and invest in those companies that share their values. It also analyzes clients' portfolios and calculate an overall score to see how well their portfolios align with the values most important to them. We are also excited about our mutual fund marketplace, which offers 37,000 funds, all with no custody fee to our clients around the world. Because we do not offer our own funds, we do not compete against our clients. To close, when we started our brokerage business in 1993, we thought a good goal to have, one that would motivate us, but seem like a distant target far in the future would be to achieve 100,000 accounts on our platform. We reached that in 2008, 15 years later. We thought again about what an achievable but distant goal would be and came up with one million accounts. I'm happy to say we achieved that goal in October, 12 years later. Our goal now is 80 million accounts or 1% of world population. How long will that take? We are not sure, but think 10 to 15 years. It is encouraging that there is one country today, which I'm not going to name, where we have accounts from over 1% of its population. This is a high target. Similar to our earlier goal, it is a ways away, but can be achieved. If we continue to automate and attract customers by giving them the tools, low pricing and global product access they need to succeed.  With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul? Thank you everyone for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website and we'll be putting up a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again and we will talk to you next quarter end."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Paul Brody",
            "content": "Thank you, Nancy. Thanks everybody for joining the call. As usual, I'll review our fourth quarter and then the full year results main factors that drove those numbers and then we'll open it up for questions. On the whole for the year, the pandemic and actions by the Federal Reserve, which stirred up the markets and reduced U.S. interest rates near zero, produced a substantial shift in the components of our revenue. Strong gains in commissions bolstered by a flood of new customer accounts more than made up for the drop in net interest income. Comparing the fourth quarter to the prior year, the contributions to net revenues of commissions and net interest income changed from 34% and 57% to 48% and 38%. The combination together with other revenue streams produced a 20% year-over-year increase in quarterly net revenues and record annual pre-tax income.  Turning to operating data. Trading volumes and customer account openings continued at the high levels we've seen throughout the year, leading to strong growth in accounts, client equity, client credit balances, margin lending and securities lending. Total accounts grew to about $1.1 million, up 56% year-over-year, contributing to client equity growth of 66%. We saw growth in all customer segments and in particular, in individuals and introducing brokers. Market volatility though higher than last year was the lowest this quarter for 2020. As measured by the average mix, volatility rose to 25.7% in the fourth quarter, up 83% year-over-year, but down from its second quarter 2020 peak of nearly 35%. However, the band between this quarter's low and high vex of 20% and 40% was wider than in the third quarter and wider than any quarter last year. This contributed to strong trading volumes and a 71% increase in commissions.  Despite continued low or negative interest rates worldwide, our net interest income fell only 22% versus the fourth quarter of '19, thanks to strength in customer cash balances, margin lending and securities lending. 56% account growth provided a tailwind due to strong volumes in all product categories. Customer contract and share volumes in options, futures and stocks grew 76%, 22% and 215% respectively for the fourth quarter and 67%, 30% and 97% respectively for the year.  Our volumes outpaced overall industry volumes in the U. S., which were up in nearly all categories and FX dollar volumes rose as well. DARTs reached a record of $2.1 million more than 2.5 times to $797,000 of the fourth quarter last year. Our average cleared commission for DART was down 32% to $2.46 for several reasons: First, more trading and equities relative to derivatives. Derivatives are more expensive, though not necessarily more profitable due to relatively high exchange fees. Second, higher volumes of IBKR orders that added liquidity were routed to exchanges, generating more rebates from the exchanges. These are passed on in a form of reduced commissions to customers choosing tiered commission. And third, smaller average trade side. Results for the full year reflected the continued momentum and operational leverage of our core brokerage business. Full year commissions rose 58% on high volatility in volumes. Net interest income fell 19% with the impact of near zero interest rates, partially offset by higher customer cash and margin loan balances, as well as strong securities lending. Higher volumes were seen in all product categories, surpassing general overall industry volume trends. For the full year, total DARTs rose 115% and average commission per DART fell 24% for the reasons I pointed to earlier. The net interest margin table shows that our net interest margin tightened in the fourth quarter to 1.04%, down from 1.70% in the year ago period. For the year, net interest margin was 1.07%, down from 1.70% last year, despite the drop in U.S. benchmark rates to near zero, higher-margin loan balances, a strong securities lending performance and some positive contribution to customer credit balanced interest from those currencies with negative rate kept the NIM from falling further. The Federal Reserve lowered rates to a target range of 0 to 25 basis points in the first quarter and has kept them there since. Internationally, rates are near zero or negative in nearly every country in which we do business. During the year, we kept a relatively short duration on our U.S. treasury portfolio. In the low rate environment, we recorded a mark-to-market loss of $4.5 million for the year, including a nominal loss in the fourth quarter. As always, we plan to hold these securities to maturities, so these gains and losses are temporary. But as brokers unlike banks, GAAP rules require us to mark these securities to market in our financial reporting. This is one of our non-GAAP items that we consider to be non-core. Outside the U.S., interest rates were predominantly zero to negative. We recorded positive interest on certain customer cash balances, where we pass through negative rate costs on these currents. For rate increases that may occur in the future, note that about 25% of our customer credit balances are not in U.S. dollars. So changes in U.S rates will not impact all of these balances. Despite higher customer cash balances, segregated cash interest income fell due to the collapse in rates and a persistently flat yield curve. Average margin loan balances rose 19% and finished the year 26% over the year ago quarter, as investors displayed an increased appetite for risk. Our growth reflects our ability to fulfill the needs of larger customers as opportunities arise. So despite our narrow spread over benchmark rates on margin loans, we continue to experience some spread compression in this low rate environment. We consider our low-margin rates, a significant factor in attracting investors to interact with brokers. Securities lending interest income was up 44% this quarter and 33% for the full year. Our automation allows us to optimize the availability of customer positions to lend hard to borrow high rate securities and customer short stock value, which rose 6% from the prior year end is largely covered by customer margin stocks, reducing our need to borrow from external counterparties. Now, for our estimates of the impact of the next 25 basis point increase in rates, when calculating the impact of rate changes, we understand that as the possibility of a future rate increase becomes more certain, this expectation is typically already reflected in the yields of the instruments in which we invest. Therefore, we attempt to isolate the impact of an unexpected rise or fall in rates, separate from the impact of rate hikes or cuts that have already been baked into the prices of these instruments. With that assumption, we would expect the next 25 basis point on anticipated rise in rates to produce an additional $98 million in net interest income over the next four quarters and $103 million as the yearly run rate based on our current balance sheet. These numbers are highly sensitive to benchmark rate changes due to the impact of low rates on the spread between what we earn on our segregated cash and what we pay to our customers. When U.S. rates fell below 50 basis points, our spread compressed as we're able to earn less when investing our segregated cash. However, the converse is also true that as rates move back up towards 50 basis points, our spread expands significantly. The yearly run rate includes the reinvestment of all of our present holdings at the new assumed rate, but does not take into account any change in how we manage our segregated cash. If we're successful in continuing to grow our customer assets, higher cash and margin lending balances will offset some of the loss of net interest income from low benchmark rates. Turning to our income statement, as a reminder, one year ago, we began reporting our consolidated numbers only and we no longer report segment. We define non-core items as those not part of our fundamental operating results. Non-core items included four items this quarter. First, our currency diversification strategy produced a loss of $13 million versus a $12 million gain last year. Second, the nominal mark-to-market loss on U.S. government securities of $300,000 versus $1 million in the prior year. Third, a gain on our investments of $33 million versus a loss of $15 million last year; and fourth, tax and related adjustments netting to a $10 million addition to net income at public company level. The net effect of these adjustments raised net income by $11 million this quarter versus decreasing it by $600,000 last year. Net revenues were reported $599 million for the quarter, up 20% versus last year's fourth quarter. And excluding non-core items, net revenues were $582 million, up 16% versus last year. Commission revenue rose 71% to $288 million on significantly higher trade volumes in all product categories. Net interest income fell 22% to $225 million, though it was up sequentially. The decline was predominantly due to the drop in global interest rates to near zero and below. Other fees and services revenues rose 44% to $52 million. These include market data, exposure and account activity fees as well as fees generated from facilitating customers' participation in IPO. Other income, a more variable category that includes gains and losses on our investments and currency strategy as well as principal transactions was $34 million versus $9 million in the fourth quarter last year. Ex non-core items, other income increased to $17 million from $12 million a year ago. Non-interest expenses were $207 million for the quarter, up 10% from last year due primarily to higher execution and clearing costs on stronger trade volumes and higher employee compensation and benefits costs. Execution and clearing expense did not grow as rapidly as trade volume for several reasons, including the mix of products traded as well as the higher amount of rebates paid by exchanges when IBKR orders routed there at liquidity. Note that these rebates partially offset commission revenues, which reduces the average commission per DART. Employee compensation and benefits costs rose 15% and occupancy and communications expenses both grew $1 million as we expanded our presence in Europe. At quarter end, our total headcount stood at 2,033, a 24% increase over last year as we expanded to service significantly more customers, staff our new European offices and further strengthen our compliance functions. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of our employees worldwide have been working remotely. After a brief pause in the first quarter, we hired throughout the remainder of 2020, primarily in client services, appliance and systems development. Fixed expenses, which are non-interest expenses less the variable cost of execution and clearing fees were $141 million, up 8%, driven by higher compensation and benefits as well as some increase in occupancy and communications. G&A expenses were down 6% on the year ago quarter and 19% sequentially, primarily due to the non-recurrence of legal and related costs. The sequential decrease reflects the drop in expenses associated with the development of our enhanced global compliance program, which while still elevated, began to roll-off. Customer bad debt expense was immaterial this quarter. For the year, this expense was $13 million, well within our typical $0 million to $5 million per quarter range. Reported pretax income was $392 million, up 26%, despite a $62 million drop in net interest income for a 65% margin. Excluding non-core items, pre-tax income was $375 million, up 19% for a 64% margin. Diluted earnings per share were $0.81 for the quarter versus $0.57 in the year ago quarter. In ex non-core items, diluted earnings per share were $0.69 versus $0.58 for 2019. And for the full year, diluted earnings per share were $2.42 versus $2.10 last year and $2.49 versus $2.27 last year as adjusted. To help investors better understand how our earnings and taxes are split between public shareholders and non-controlling interest, the fourth quarter numbers are as follow; starting with our unadjusted pre-tax income of $392 million, we add back $4 million of standalone net expense at the public company to get the operating company's pre-tax income. We then deduct $4 million for income taxes paid by our operating company, which are mostly for intact. This leaves $392 million, of which 79.1% or that $309 million reported on our income statement is attributable to non-controlling interest. The remaining 20.9% or $83 million is available for the public company shareholders. As this is a non-GAAP measure, it is not reported on our income statement. After we deduct the $4 million public company standalone net expense and after expensing remaining taxes of $8 million owed on that $83 million, the public company's net income available for common stockholders is the $71 million you see reported on our income statement. Income tax expense line of $12 million consists of this $8 million plus the $4 million of taxes paid by the operating company. And one additional note on income tax, the current quarter's tax includes about $11 million in prior period adjustment benefits that are not expected to be recurring, including an approximately $8 million net benefit related to the revaluation of our deferred tax asset, which is included in our non-GAAP results. Turning to the balance sheet with $9 billion in consolidated equity at December 31, 2020, we are well capitalized from a regulatory standpoint. We deploy our strong capital base toward opportunities to grow our business and investing opportunities worldwide as well as to emphasize the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners. Our capital is deployed across 14 registered broker-dealer type entities around the world, supporting regulatory capital requirements, liquidity needs, margin lending and other financing opportunities in our growing brokerage business. And we continue to carry no long-term debt. With that, I will turn the call back over to the moderator, and we'll be happy to take questions. Yes. Sure. For us, it's opportunistic when we get opportunities to place money at higher rates we do. The notes program gives us some flexibility after using what is otherwise house capital. It's a relatively short-term, relatively high rate to the investor. It started at 50 basis points, and then we ratcheted up to 1%. And they can roll over, in other words, we can redeem them at any time if we feel that the opportunities are no longer there or temporarily no longer there. So, it seems to be a very good program for us so far, and it got some pretty good take up from the start. The note... I think we were at $90-something million by the end of the year. No. The payments for that go into other fees and services are actually the exchange mandated programs and options exchanges where they rebate part of the liquidity producing orders. To the extent to the payment for order flow on the IBKR Lite actually nets into the commission. That's accounting convention, but it's clear how that comes out. And I was going to mention that in market data, although it's the largest item in that category, it's primarily a pass-through, right? We pay for market data, and then we collect on market data and we make a small spread on."

            "content": "We probably increase expenses at least by 15% as we're trying to build out the new entities and of course, continue to build our customer service, our compliance departments and our ability to create new software. It's all about growing the company. That's why I'm... That's why I'm tearing my hair out. I'm mystified by the margin that is not increasing. What else can we do, but being by far the lowest offering, by far the lowest margin rate. And it's not that our current customers don't borrow more. I'm questioning why people who are out there at all these other brokers paying 3%, 4%, 5%, why they don't come over. So -- Yes. I don't know the answer. Some of our other internal shareholders have sold shares, unfortunately, too early. Yes. Right. Thank you. So, that we are in the midst of transitioning these accounts. They have not all been transitioned, but most of them have been. And, yes, so that is the plan. By the end of the month that will be completed. And the plan is to, yes, handle all the EU clients from Ireland, Luxembourg and Budapest. There's a lot of upside in Ireland and in Central Europe, and that's exactly why we put in those two entities. We don't see anything. Okay. Thank you. I would be much too scared to extend the duration, because I think inflation must be lurking in the bushes. I guess I can't understand how we can issue trillions of dollars of new money every other month and not feel the inflation. I don't understand what goes on. It can't go on like this forever. Well, you have to excuse us. We do not talk about events past the year end. Right. Sure. So, the new clients trade a little bit less, but not by much. That's the answer. So, a new client -- ...the new clients probably trade around 80% to 85% as much as the old ones. Well, surprisingly, Canada is one of the strongest. But in Europe, it's mostly Eastern Europe and Asia; it's the same old, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the surrounding countries. It's substantially diminished from China, probably because of the difficulty of getting money out. Paul, could you address this question? So, it's mostly market data. It's exposure fees that we charge to customers who's basically P&L profile can violate certain limits that we like to put on, because we basically -- we're not looking to expand -- we're not looking to collect on the exposure fees, but our real purpose is to try to get the client to rain in the risk in their position. But, nevertheless, it contributes to our income. But on the long run, we feel that we will pay that out in losses that the customers will not be able to make good. What other item is there, Paul? The payment for order flow comes from the IBKR Lite accounts, right, where we -- yeah. Can you say that again? It's fairly stable around those numbers. Although not that we are integrating with the folio customers, some 60,000 customers that are coming over, we're putting them all into IBKR Lite, so -- and leave it up to them if they want to switch to Pro. So you will see the proportion of live customers shut up by the end of the month."

And I'm a reluctant seller, but must recognize the two issues I'm frequently asked about. One is the small float that scares away a large would be purchasers of the stock. And second is, the taxes on that, that I could -- that could force liquidation. In order to show some movement to deal with these two issues, but also to keep holding on to most of my stock, I just started selling program that would dispose of the shares gradually over the next 60-years. I will implement a trading program that sells 20,000 shares on each business day.  As our average daily volume is roughly 600,000 shares, these shares are not expected to have much of an impact on the price. I will start the daily sales of 20,000 shares every business day, trying to achieve the daily VWAP. I have been approached by several potential investors and brokers who offered to buy a block of stock, but my answer is always the same, and it will remain the same. If you want the stock, you need to buy it in the open market.  The second is Brexit. As a global broker, we operate in legal and regulatory environment of many localities, countries and regions. On this ever shifting landscape, we finally must adapt our operations, including our corporate structure and operating licenses to continue servicing our existing and new clients at high levels. This is a particular focus in Europe, in the context of Brexit. UK and EU negotiations have been ongoing for several years with more than a few changes in direction, and postponements of the effective date. If the current withdrawal agreement is onward, Brexit will become effective on December 31st of this year. As we conduct our European business primarily through our UK broker, and to a lesser extent, through our Luxembourg broker, we have applied for additional licenses in Europe, through our affiliates Interactive Brokers Ireland and Interactive Brokers Central Europe. While we have been at this effort for some time, our license applications are pending for both affiliates, and we think it's quite possible that one or both is still being progressed on December 31st. While the outcome depends on many factors, including regulatory flexibility and interpretations, it is possible that we will be facing a temporary gap during which we could be unable to fully service some EU customers for a short period of time, subsequent to the year-end which could negatively impact our business in Europe. We think that any delay in our ability to service affected EU clients or open new accounts would be limited and temporary.  The third item is margins. Much has been made of our recently announced policy to slowly increase certain margin requirements in the run-up to the election. Given the uncertainty over the market during this time, we believe this is the correct prudent step to take to protect our costumers and ourselves. We have given more than sufficient notice of our intention and we are implementing the increase very gradually and do not see any major issues.  And now back to you, Nancy.\nNancy Stuebe: Thanks. In the third quarter, we continued to see strength in our business, as more and more people and countries around the world chose to invest in the markets. Accounts rose 47% year-on-year to 981,000 as we added 105,500 net new accounts in the quarter. Client equity grew by 49% to $233 billion as new and existing clients worldwide sought to take advantage of the market opportunities they saw. Growth came in all client segments and all geographic regions, with areas outside the U.S. particularly strong once again. This international growth continues to result in a more even customer distribution among the countries and regions that we serve. Over the course of the quarter, clients grew more comfortable with putting money into the market and taking on leverage, with margin loans growing from 24.9 billion at June 30, to 30 billion at this quarter end. As clients traded more actively during this period of high market volatility, our total DARTs reached over 1.8 million, more than doubling from last year, and cleared average DARTs per account was 49% to 442. Because our platform is highly automated, the marginal cost of adding an additional client diminishes as we reach higher account numbers. The limit to this diminishment in marginal cost is the expense of KYC and other compliance obligations we have, especially high with respect to the customers in foreign jurisdiction. This expense we can regard as a fixed cost to add a new account. To the extent the profit derived from such a new account exceeds these fixed costs, we continue to focus on growing our new accounts. Automation also enables us to offer worldwide access to financial instruments ranging from equities, fixed income, funds, derivatives and FX among others, giving us the diversity of products to attract customers from all geographies. Since the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to near zero in March, our net interest income has been affected. Higher margin loans, an influx of cash into new and existing customer accounts, and a strong security finance performance led to 195 million of net interest income for the quarter, despite our segregated cash and securities yielding only 13 basis points. We continue to invest our segregated cash in the safest short-term securities as a flat yield curve with near zero interest rates means there's no advantage to buying long-term securities or taking on the risks that non-U.S. Treasury investments bring. Finally, our total equity surpassed $8.5 billion in the third quarter, our highest to-date. With no debt our balance sheet remains solid. As we continue to grow, a strong equity capital helps us attract larger international and institutional clients. Once again, we saw growth in all five of the client types that we service. I will now go over our five client segments.  Individual customers, which made up 56% of our accounts, 36% of our client equity, and 54% of our commissions, continue to be our fastest growing segment with 12 month account growth of 65%, client equity growth of 64% and 42% growth in latest 12 months commissions. All geographic regions we serve saw accounts, client equity and commissions grew over 30% with international growth from Europe and Asia outpacing the Americas for now. Global investor demand for a reliable platform with a wide choice of products in international markets continues as investors seek to maximize their investment opportunities. Proprietary trading firms are 2% of our accounts, 10% of client equity, and 14% of commissions. For the quarter, this group grew 22% in accounts for the 12 month period, 35% in client equity and 29% in commissions. Prop trading firms are sensitive to the direction of volatility and the quarter\u2019s high volatility offered them numerous opportunities. Prop traders also tend to have more active trading strategies, which benefits from our low cost platform that provides access to securities around the globe. But most importantly, proprietary traders depend on trading profits, and execution quality is a major determinant of trading profits. This is what attracts most prop traders to our platform.  Hedge fund accounts for the 12 months ended September 30th grew 2% in accounts, 27% in customer equity and 8% in commissions. Hedge funds represent 1% of our accounts, 7% of our client equity and 8% of our commissions. We were pleased to see 27% growth in customer equity as the hedge fund industry\u2019s assets under management have been flat for about two years now. So our growth here indicates strong results in a flat industry. Growing word of mouth, our reputation for best price execution and low margin rates, and the quality of our platform, are behind this growth.  Financial advisors are 12% of our accounts, 18% of our customer equity and 13% of our commissions. This group grew accounts by 14% for the 12 month period, while customer equity rose 17% and commissions 7%. As advisors tend to be more conservative in their activity, their commission growth tends to grow more slowly in periods of high volatility. After quarter end, the back to back closings of two industry transactions meant fewer competitors in the space. We continue to see opportunity in this area. With fewer competitors, it is easier to get visibility when both new and existing [FAs] research their platform options, especially when they hear about new fees, learn about hidden fees and potentially find themselves competing against their broker.  Our final segment is introducing brokers. These represent 30% of our accounts, 29% of our client equity and 12% of our 12 month commissions. Our brokers segment account growth was 38% for the latest 12 months with 86% client equity growth and 71% in commissions. We saw growth in this segment in all regions with Asia showing particular strength. Because we offer global markets and products along with seamless back office functionality, we can grow in regions where customers may not be large enough to draw the attention of bulge bracket banks, or even if they did, would be charged extremely high prices for international access.  In 2020, as more people worldwide sought to invest or to diversify their assets, they wanted the ability to access many markets and products in their search for returns and asset safety.  Turning to new products, offerings this quarter included our new Impact Dashboard, which helps investors evaluate the portfolios so they can make adjustments and invest in companies whose ESG worldviews correspond with our own. As ESG investing grows in importance and in assets allocated, Impact Dashboard allows our clients to select the principles and practices most important to them. And then see how each individual investment in their portfolio moves them closer to or farther from their goals. Our mutual fund marketplace has grown to over 34,000 no-load mutual funds from over 285 fund families, making Interactive Brokers one of the largest, if not the largest fund agnostic supermarkets. As always, we do not charge a custody fee and the funds can be accessed by our clients at over 200 countries and territories. We have been spending more on advertising and continue to see good response to our digital marketing efforts. In fact, Google AdWords is using Interactive Brokers as a case study in successful digital marketing efforts. For years, ever since we started our electronic broker in 1993, our dream was 1 million accounts. And sometime within the next week, we will welcome our 1 millionth client. Our goal now is to achieve 80 million accounts or 1% of the global population. To do this in 20 years would be a 25% annual growth rate. To do this in 10 years is the 55% growth rate. There is 1 country today where Interactive Brokers has a nearly 1% share of the population, clearly indicating that 1% or 80 million worldwide is not an impossible dream. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul?\nPaul Brody : Thank you, Nancy. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. As usual, I'll first review our operating results and non-core items. And my comments will follow the format of the earnings release, after which we'll open up the call for questions. As a reminder, starting this year, we began reporting without separate business segments as our remaining market making activity is no longer material to our overall results. We also separated other fees and services from other income. Other fees and services contains recurring items such as market data fees, account activity fees and FDIC Bank Sweep Program income and other income consists of items that are less predictable in nature, like currency impact, U.S. Treasury marks-to-market, principal trading activities and other investment gains or losses. Looking at the operating data, high trading volumes and customer account openings continued as volatility still at elevated levels moderated from the second quarter. The continued global impact of the coronavirus as well as uncertainty over the upcoming U.S. election and Brexit are likely contributors to highly active markets worldwide. Volatility, as measured by the average VIX, rose 62% to 25.9 in the current quarter from 15.9 in the same quarter last year. However, while the VIX peaked at 34, the current quarter was less volatile than the first and second quarters of 2020 when the VIX spiked to 82 for a short time in March and to 57 in April. Quarterly total DARTs increased 113% to a record 1.8 million compared to the third quarter of 2019, and our customer trade volumes continued to rise dramatically in every product class, led by increases of 65%, 9% and 109% in options, futures and stocks, respectively. FX dollar volumes were strong as well, increasing over 30%. Total accounts reached 981,000, up 47% over the prior year, with quarterly net new accounts added at a pace once again about 5 times higher than last year's quarter. This contributed to client equity growth of 49% to 232.7 billion at quarter end. Our overall average cleared commission per commissionable order fell 27% versus last year to $2.69 due to a product mix that featured smaller average trade sizes across all product classes. Smaller trade sizes are often seen in high volatility periods as traders choose to risk less per trade in fast-moving markets. We also saw higher exchange rebates which we pass-through to our clients in the form of lower commissions as our strong order volume led to our capturing incentives offered by exchanges on liquidity providing orders. Overall, higher commission revenues show that the strong increase in trade volumes more than made up for the drop in commission per commissionable order. Moving to our net interest margin table. Net interest margin narrowed from 1.77% in last year's quarter to 0.94%. The Federal Reserve brought its benchmark target rate down to near zero in March and has kept it there. The average effective Fed funds rate, which we use to price both margin loans and interest paid on customer cash, fell from 2.19% in the third quarter of '19 to 0.09% in the third quarter of '20. While significantly lower rates reduce what we pay on our customer credit balances, they also reduce what we earn on segregated cash and margin loans. Nevertheless, our net interest margin narrowed just 83 basis points over this period, supported by margin loans and strong securities lending. Despite the Fed lowering the overnight interest rate, the yield curve remains fairly flat as it has for several quarters. We have kept the duration of our portfolio relatively short and recorded a mark-to-market loss of $2 million on our holdings of U.S. treasuries, similar to last year's third quarter. As always, we plan to hold these securities to maturity, so any gains and losses on our marks-to-market each quarter should trend towards zero over time. But as brokers, unlike banks, GAAP rules require that we mark our portfolio to market in our financial reporting. Outside the U.S., benchmark interest rates remained near or below zero for many currencies as central banks continued to attempt to soften the impact from COVID-19 on their economies. Despite a 28% increase over the year ago quarter in average customer credit balances, the reduction in interest expense paid on these balances was the largest contributor, preventing our net interest margin from falling further. Not only our most credit balances paid zero interest, some balances in negative rate currencies produced revenue on the pass-through to some customers. We continue to have success in asset gathering. And our FDIC Insured Bank Deposit Sweep Program held an average of $3 billion a year, up $800 million from last year. Margin lending and securities lending were the largest contributors to our net interest margin. Average margin loan balances rose 9% from last year. However, due to significantly lower benchmark interest rates, margin loan interest income fell 53%. Margin loans have shown a steady climb back, ending the quarter at $30.3 billion, up 17% versus last year and up 18% from the second quarter. Securities lending interest income was up 12% this year -- this quarter versus a strong year ago quarter as we continue to execute on hard to borrow names that investors were looking to short. On segregated cash, despite a 48% increase in segregated cash balances, lower investment rates led to a 91% decline in interest income. Several factors caused the yields on our segregated cash to differ from the change in the Fed funds rate. First, a portion is held in other currencies; and second, given an average duration of investment in treasuries of about 44 days, reinvestments take place over time. So some of our investments in segregated cash would not be expected to follow Fed rate declines immediately. We are approaching the tail-end of our investments at higher rates and maturity of the small amount remaining will not have a material impact on our overall investment rate. The increase in segregated cash balances is primarily a function of credit balances growing at a faster rate than margin loans and net investment purchases. While investors continue to take on leverage this quarter, the steady consistent growth in our clients' cash outpaced the growth in both of these factors. Note too that the FDIC Sweep Program removes funds that would otherwise be included in our segregated cash balances from our balance sheet for accounting purpose. Now for our estimate of the impact of the next 25 basis point increase in rates, when calculating the impact of rate changes, we understand that as the possibility of a future rate increase becomes more certain, this expectation typically is already reflected in the yields of the instruments in which we invest. Therefore, we attempt to isolate the impact of an unexpected rise or fall in rates, separate from the impact of rate hikes or cuts that have already been baked into the prices of these instruments. With that assumption, we would expect the next 25 basis point unanticipated rise in rates to produce an additional $94 million in net interest income over the next 4 quarters and $103 million as the yearly run rate based on our current balance sheet. These numbers are highly sensitive to benchmark rate changes due to the impact of low rates on the spread between what we earn on our segregated cash and what we pay our customers. As U.S. rates fell below 50 basis points, our spread compressed as we earn less when investing our segregated cash. However, the converse is also true that as rates move back up toward 50 basis points, our spread expands significantly. The run rate includes the reinvestment of all of our present holdings at the new assumed rate, but does not take into account any change in how we manage our segregated cash. If we are successful in continuing to grow our customer assets, higher cash and margin lending balances, will provide some offset to the loss of net interest income from low benchmark rates, should they persist. Turning to our income statement. As I mentioned earlier, in 2020, we began reporting our consolidated numbers only, we no longer report segment. We define non-core items as those not part of our fundamental operating results. Non-core items included 3 items this quarter. First, our currency diversification strategy produced a gain of $27 million versus a $47 million loss last year. Second, mark-to-market loss on U.S. government securities of $2 million, the same as the prior year. And third, a gain on our investments of $5 million versus a loss of $10 million last year. The net effect of these adjustments raised pre-tax income by $30 million this quarter versus reducing it by $59 million last year. Net revenues were a reported $548 million for the quarter, up 18% versus last year's third quarter. Excluding non-core items, net revenue was $518 million, down 1% versus last year. Commission revenue rose 49% on significantly higher trade volumes in all product categories. Net interest income fell 33% to $195 million, though it was about even with the second quarter. The decline was largely due to the drop in the average effective Fed funds rate versus the year ago quarter. Other fees and services revenues rose 29% to $45 million. These include market data, exposure, account activity and FDIC Bank Sweep Program fees as well as fees generated from facilitating customers' participation in IPO. Other income, which includes the gains and losses on our investments and currency strategy as well as principal transactions, was $29 million versus a $47 million loss last year. That was primarily due to currency effects on the global. Ex non-core items, other income decreased from a gain of $12 million to a loss of $1 million this quarter. This includes a $13 million loss on our investment in the OneChicago exchange, which ceased operations in September. Non-interest expenses were $214 million for the quarter, up 16% from last year due primarily to higher execution and clearing costs, in line with higher trade volume. Also, higher employee compensation and benefits costs and $3 million in customer bad debt versus a $2 million recovery last year.  At quarter end, our total headcount stood at 1,923, a 22% increase over last year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of our employees worldwide have been working remotely. After a brief pause in the first quarter, we have been hiring again to keep up with the influx of new accounts and to strengthen client services, compliance and systems development for the future. Fixed expenses were $137 million, up 15% driven by higher compensation and benefits as well as some increase in occupancy. G&A expenses were up 23%, a substantial portion of which were expenses associated with the development of and consultants for our compliance program. While the increase in compliance staff has raised our compensation and benefits expenses, we believe that most of the cost of outside consultants has been recognized and will not be recurring. Customer bad debt expense was $3 million, well within the zero to $5 million we expect in any given quarter and well-contained despite the increase in activity and volatility.  Reported pre-tax income was $334 million, up 19% despite a $96 million drop in net interest income for a 61% margin. Excluding non-core items, pre-tax income was $304 million, down 11% for a 59% pre-tax margin. Diluted earnings per share were $0.58 for the quarter versus $0.45 for the same period in 2019. And ex non-core items, diluted earnings per share was $0.53 versus $0.57 last year as adjusted.  To help investors better understand our earnings, taxes and the split between the public shareholders and the non-controlling interest, third quarter numbers are as follows: Starting with our unadjusted pre-tax income of $334 million, we deduct $18 million for income taxes paid by our operating companies, which are mostly foreign taxes. This leaves $316 million, of which 81.2%, or about $256 million reported on our income statement is attributable to non-controlling interest. The remaining 18.8% or $60 million is available for public company shareholders. As this is the non-GAAP measure, it is not reported on our income statement. After we expense, remaining taxes of $14 million owed on that $60 million, the public company's net income available for common stockholders is the $46 million you see reported on our income statement. The income tax expense line of $32 million consists of this $14 million, plus the $18 million of taxes paid by the operating company.  Two additional notes on operating company's income tax. The current quarter tax includes about $5 million in prior period adjustments that are not expected to be recurring. And second, the current rate is running about $1 million per quarter higher than previously due to increased tax costs outside the U.S.  Turning to the balance sheet, with $8.5 billion in consolidated equity, we are well-capitalized from a regulatory standpoint. We deploy our strong capital base toward opportunities to grow our brokerage business worldwide as well as to emphasize the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners. We continue to carry no long-term debt. And at September 30th, margin loans were $30.3 billion, up $4.4 billion versus last year. We continue to expect swings in margin lending balances, reflecting both economic conditions and our success in attracting institutional customers who are more opportunistic in taking on leverage. We offer the lowest margin lending rates of our competitors. And as we expand our customer base, we remain well-positioned to satisfy our customers' risk appetite. Now, I'll turn it over to moderator, and we will take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Your question please.\nRich Repetto : So first question, Thomas, is trying to put sort of a quantity around or quantify the risk of the EU and not getting the broker approval. Is there any way you can talk about potentially how it could impact either revenue or DARTs if you didn't get certain brokers approved?\nThomas Peterffy : I don't think that the impact would be noticeable. It would only -- I think it would be only noticeable to the extent of opening new accounts. And there you're trading. So I don't expect that it will make much of a noticeable impact in the numbers.\nRich Repetto : Because -- I'm assuming because the other existing accounts could still continue to trade.\nThomas Peterffy : That's right.\nRich Repetto : Another question. The margin loans have dramatically increased since they bottomed in March at a little bit over $30 billion and sort of roughly flat with sort of the higher quarters of last year. But I guess my question, can you see the margin loan balances -- given that accounts have grown by 50%, and the best of our ability, the account quality, when it looks like -- when you look at average client equity or average trading, it's still the same. So are you -- could you expect to see a improvement in people starting to lever up more?\nThomas Peterffy : I do expect that but you must consider the fact that, number one, many of the new accounts are less of the professional trader type that we originally had and more of the investor type, so they tend to use less margin. And second, we have tightened up many of our requirements because of understandable reasons, right?\nRich Repetto : Yes. Yes. Expected volatility here. I guess, my last question is, Thomas, if I got the math down right, the selling at 20,000 per day is around 5 -- a little bit over 5 million shares a year. I think over the 60-year period, you'd be a young at 130. So if you are doing this to manage a state and the other reasons you noted at the beginning of the call, would you ever, at some point, entertain selling your asset books?\nThomas Peterffy : All I have to sell is enough to pay the tax, right, when I die, right? Between now and then I die, I have to sign up to pay the tax at that time, right?\nRich Repetto : Alright. Okay. Okay. That's the goal of this selling.\nThomas Peterffy : That's right.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your question please.\nCraig Siegenthaler : Could you provide us an update on your initiative to obtain a bank charter in the U.S.? And also, just remind us what products could come out of a bank charter besides cash sweep?\nThomas Peterffy : So the effort to get a bank charter got side tracked at the time when we had the SEC-CFTC findings against us. And so we'll have to digest steps and really prove that we have taken all the necessary steps, and the regulator should be very happy with everything we have done. And so that's probably going to take maybe 2 or 3 more quarters.\nCraig Siegenthaler : Got it. And Thomas, I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you give us a start date for the 10b5?\nThomas Peterffy : I think it's November 2.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Nance from Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nWill Nance : So you're on track, I guess, to increase the account base by about 50%. And I know you aren't encouraging us to assume that this kind of continues at this rate. But just taking this massive acceleration of growth of the franchise, the face value, has this led to any evolution in your thinking...\nThomas Peterffy : Well, that would be mutual thinking. I don't actually think that it will continue at 50%. But it will continue the portfolio at a fairly high rate.\nWill Nance : Right, right, right. So even conservatively, though, the franchise has already expanded pretty considerably. So I guess when you think about the growth that you've already seen, has this changed any of your thoughts in terms of what types of products, customer-facing features, geographies, you need to be investing in or is it still kind of more of the same?\nThomas Peterffy : So it's more of the same in the sense that we are investing heavily in automation, more and more in automating customer engagement, watching, having automated facilities that watch our customers and interact with them as -- watch what they are doing and interact with them and telling them about the various options. We have -- they try and are useful of the movement and they do whatever they are doing, that sort of automation. We are certainly going to continue to increase our marketing -- digital marketing expenditure around the world. And so we do hope that we can continue to grow at a very hefty rate, and we're going to invest whatever we can usefully spend in our view in further growth.\nWill Nance : Got it. That's helpful. And then just at a high level, activity rates are extremely high right now. And I guess, your customer base is more engaged than they have been in recent years. And so I guess, is there anything that's on your mind, I guess, other than the election that would make you think that maybe this comes to an end sooner than later? Or maybe conversely, what could kind of prolong these levels of activity? Does it really just come down to volatility? Or is there -- are you seeing like kind of different types of behavior for the customer base?\nThomas Peterffy : Well, in the last couple of weeks, we do notice some variation in activity, and -- which would be expected in -- as we come up to the election. And then, of course, I think it will pick up when the results come up, especially if the Senate goes to Democratic, I expect that people will start taking the long-term gains because of the expected 43% long-term capital gains, tax rate. And then of course, we are looking further on the road more and more expanding and that will result in asset inflation, including higher and higher stock prices. So that's not unique to Interactive Brokers. That's going to be just general. The financial services industry will have a fairly good time.\nWill Nance : Got it. That makes sense. And then just last question. I mean you have $70 billion of client cash with a negative yield, and I think there are a lot of financial institutions out there that would salivate at having a funding profile that looks like that. When I look at how it's being monetized today, it's only roughly half of it is being monetized kind of funding margin loans. And there's still a fair amount that's earning 15, recognizing it's very difficult to monetize anything in this kind of interest rate environment. Do you spend a lot of time thinking about how to kind of improve the economics on some of the client cash over time? And do you have to reach a point where you feel like there's some -- you need to kind of optimize that equation?\nThomas Peterffy : We keep trying to expand our margin lending, but without being -- while we remain careful because we don't want to take on new risks. But -- so that's basically certainly a focus. We do not see any -- as you know, we are restricted in how we can invest our money. And we are certainly not looking at lower-grade infrequent, illiquid governments or long-term governments. That's not for us.\nPaul Brody : So let me just add to that, if I could, Thomas. You have to understand also that outside the U.S. it's not permitted regulatorily to use client credits to fund margin lending. They have to be kept separate. You segregate all of the credits and you finance the margin lending. And about 24% of our customer credits are outside the U.S. So what may appear to be a lesser use of our client balances, you have to take that into account.\nWill Nance : Got it. That's helpful color. And good luck with continuing the 50% account growth.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your question please.\nKyle Voigt : I believe several years ago, Interactive Brokers paid a special dividend ahead of potential changes to the capital gains tax rate. I'm just wondering if a special dividend will be on the table again, both the Presidency and the Senate to Democrats, as you mentioned earlier?\nThomas Peterffy: Haven't thought of special dividends.\nKyle Voigt : Okay. Just in terms of -- maybe following up on special dividend question, you still have over $6 billion of excess regulatory capital. And I know not all of that is pure excess, and you said in the past that much of that is there to support your credit rating and the prime brokerage business as well and growth there. Just wondering if you could frame, I mean, how much of that is really excess on the balance sheet? In other words, how much do you need to maintain the current credit rating and to continue to grow the prime brokerage business at these rates?\nThomas Peterffy : Paul, this is a question for you.\nPaul Brody : Sure. I can respond. So maintaining the 6 billion or so in excess regulatory capital is good prudent management that really allows us to be flexible when the market gets extremely active or when institutional clients come to us for financing opportunities, it allows us to use that without bumping into regulatory constraints. Also, though, understand that a lot of our capital is, in fact, already devoted to supporting the client activity. It's spread out across many different countries and sectors. It's -- some of it helps finance margin lending that takes place outside the U.S., as I just alluded to before. So our excess at any one time is really more like between $2 billion and $3 billion, let's say, to then take on new opportunities and the new opportunities do come. They come with regularity enough that we don't want to cut down that number. We actually make use of that capital.\nKyle Voigt : The other question on just the large transaction that's happened in the space and closed in the space recently. I guess I'm curious to hear more about potential opportunities that this presents to you, both in the RIA segment and the Active Traders segment? And I guess I'm wondering if you can comment on whether you've seen any kind of over the past -- since the announcement of the deal close, if you've seen any influx in the inbound calls or account openings potentially tied to that transaction specifically?\nThomas Peterffy : I'm sorry, I -- you were breaking up. I couldn't hear the question. Paul, did you hear?\nKyle Voigt : Sorry, Thomas. I'm really asking about whether or not the Ameritrade-Schwab merger is creating opportunities for your RIA segment, you're getting more in balance customer calls\u2026. \nThomas Peterffy : Definitely. We definitely have lots of RIAs that come to kick the tires. They basically want to know that if they wanted to leave, would this be a good place to come to. So for now, it's a lot of work for us with not much business. But maybe, maybe it will materialize. You never know. So we spend a lot of time with these RIAs and then they go away and they say, oh, yes, this is very, very good to know. Thank you very much. Maybe we'll come back. And then this is the last we see them, where they were.\nKyle Voigt : Are you seeing any of that on the active trader side, Thomas?\nThomas Peterffy : I would not -- we wouldn't know that. We wouldn't -- no, I don't think so. No. I think most -- I mean most sophisticated active traders are already with us, I would think.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Your question please.\nChris Harris : Great. So first question relates to trading activity. When we speak to investors about the space, about your business, there's really, I guess, 2 narratives that have kind of developed. One is that the trading activity you're seeing today is unsustainable and volumes have to go down. And the other argument says that, no, no, we're in a new paradigm with $0, with zero commissions and kind of a work from home environment and that this trading is sustainable. Do you have a thought on that, Thomas, one way or the other? Or whether maybe you could just disagree with both of those things?\nThomas Peterffy : I think it is not sustainable at these levels, but it will certainly not go back to the levels of early in the year. So I think it will probably end up somewhere about halfway in between. That's what I would expect.\nChris Harris : Okay. Great. And I noticed that -- is the AML issue resolved? I didn't see a call out in the press release. So I'm assuming that means, yes, but just wanted have some color?\nThomas Peterffy : The AML issue was certainly resolved. We have undertaken a lot of work that we currently have to get done. And that we will get done by the end of the year, which is much earlier than what we agreed to do. But -- so the answer is that the issue is resolved. The work is not finished yet, but it will be by early next year.\nChris Harris: Okay. And what additional work still needs to be done? Is it just related to the infrastructure?\nThomas Peterffy : Yes, it's basically software and the consultants. We have a number of consultants who have imposed various -- would be nice to have ideas and some of which we had accepted, and we're working on getting them done.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen from Compass Point. Your question please.\nChris Allen : I wanted to circle back on margin lending. You had noted earlier that you're gradually increasing requirements as we head into the election, and also the margin lending balances can fluctuate. I was wondering maybe you could give us an update in terms of where they stand currently versus the quarter end number, which I think was 30.3 billion?\nThomas Peterffy : So we are currently in the process of increasing margin rates. And I think that will -- and I think by the end of this week -- Paul, is that correct? Do I think?\nPaul Brody : Yes, I believe that is correct. But let's remember that, by and large, these increases do not impact stock margin rates. They are focused on derivatives where the margin rates were lower to begin with. So as a result, since borrowing takes place against stocks, I wouldn't see a major impact there at all.\nThomas Peterffy : So our margin loans are gradually increasing as we speak in spite of the increase in the margin requirements.\nChris Allen : And then just a quick one on -- so for net interest income, reinvestment pressures, it seems like it's over on the seg cash side and rates have mostly stabilized. So -- and obviously, you just talked about margin lending. Sec lending, how do you feel about that moving forward? Has the box -- sec lending box continue to increase? You still feel good about the outlook there?\nPaul Brody : Oh, sure. I mean, mainly, and as I always say, it's opportunity-driven. Our base expands as our customer holdings and shorts expand. But the bigger your base, the more we can take advantage of specials, meaning stocks that get hot and in short supply and all of that, when they happen. And we've developed a lot of software to recognize and try to optimize the rates at which we can capture those opportunities. So you will see it go up and down, perhaps, because we're not in control of which stocks become special, but we do make the most of it when they exhibit that behavior.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have a follow-up from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your question please.\nKyle Voigt : Yes. Sorry. Just a follow-up for Paul, if I could, on the other fees and services. I think that's increased $5 million sequentially and $10 million year-over-year. I'm just wondering if there's anything one-off to call out in there? Or is that just a result of just overall rapid growth in accounts? And is that sustainable, I guess, is the core of the question?\nPaul Brody : It comes from a number of factors. One of the larger ones is market data, which is very much in line with the expansion of the customer base because we contract for a lot of market data and pass it on at a relatively small mark-up, but that number does expand. And really, the only other mentionable factor is, as I talked about before, we facilitate IPO participation by our customers. And that has been on the increase lately. So it has generated more fees than before.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Nancy Stuebe for any further remarks.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we'll be putting up a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we'll talk to you next quarter end.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Thomas will handle the beginning of the call and the Q&A, but asked me to present the rest of his comments. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which, by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. Thomas, please go ahead. Thanks. In the third quarter, we continued to see strength in our business, as more and more people and countries around the world chose to invest in the markets. Accounts rose 47% year-on-year to 981,000 as we added 105,500 net new accounts in the quarter. Client equity grew by 49% to $233 billion as new and existing clients worldwide sought to take advantage of the market opportunities they saw. Growth came in all client segments and all geographic regions, with areas outside the U.S. particularly strong once again. This international growth continues to result in a more even customer distribution among the countries and regions that we serve. Over the course of the quarter, clients grew more comfortable with putting money into the market and taking on leverage, with margin loans growing from 24.9 billion at June 30, to 30 billion at this quarter end. As clients traded more actively during this period of high market volatility, our total DARTs reached over 1.8 million, more than doubling from last year, and cleared average DARTs per account was 49% to 442. Because our platform is highly automated, the marginal cost of adding an additional client diminishes as we reach higher account numbers. The limit to this diminishment in marginal cost is the expense of KYC and other compliance obligations we have, especially high with respect to the customers in foreign jurisdiction. This expense we can regard as a fixed cost to add a new account. To the extent the profit derived from such a new account exceeds these fixed costs, we continue to focus on growing our new accounts. Automation also enables us to offer worldwide access to financial instruments ranging from equities, fixed income, funds, derivatives and FX among others, giving us the diversity of products to attract customers from all geographies. Since the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates to near zero in March, our net interest income has been affected. Higher margin loans, an influx of cash into new and existing customer accounts, and a strong security finance performance led to 195 million of net interest income for the quarter, despite our segregated cash and securities yielding only 13 basis points. We continue to invest our segregated cash in the safest short-term securities as a flat yield curve with near zero interest rates means there's no advantage to buying long-term securities or taking on the risks that non-U.S. Treasury investments bring. Finally, our total equity surpassed $8.5 billion in the third quarter, our highest to-date. With no debt our balance sheet remains solid. As we continue to grow, a strong equity capital helps us attract larger international and institutional clients. Once again, we saw growth in all five of the client types that we service. I will now go over our five client segments.  Individual customers, which made up 56% of our accounts, 36% of our client equity, and 54% of our commissions, continue to be our fastest growing segment with 12 month account growth of 65%, client equity growth of 64% and 42% growth in latest 12 months commissions. All geographic regions we serve saw accounts, client equity and commissions grew over 30% with international growth from Europe and Asia outpacing the Americas for now. Global investor demand for a reliable platform with a wide choice of products in international markets continues as investors seek to maximize their investment opportunities. Proprietary trading firms are 2% of our accounts, 10% of client equity, and 14% of commissions. For the quarter, this group grew 22% in accounts for the 12 month period, 35% in client equity and 29% in commissions. Prop trading firms are sensitive to the direction of volatility and the quarter's high volatility offered them numerous opportunities. Prop traders also tend to have more active trading strategies, which benefits from our low cost platform that provides access to securities around the globe. But most importantly, proprietary traders depend on trading profits, and execution quality is a major determinant of trading profits. This is what attracts most prop traders to our platform.  Hedge fund accounts for the 12 months ended September 30th grew 2% in accounts, 27% in customer equity and 8% in commissions. Hedge funds represent 1% of our accounts, 7% of our client equity and 8% of our commissions. We were pleased to see 27% growth in customer equity as the hedge fund industry's assets under management have been flat for about two years now. So our growth here indicates strong results in a flat industry. Growing word of mouth, our reputation for best price execution and low margin rates, and the quality of our platform, are behind this growth.  Financial advisors are 12% of our accounts, 18% of our customer equity and 13% of our commissions. This group grew accounts by 14% for the 12 month period, while customer equity rose 17% and commissions 7%. As advisors tend to be more conservative in their activity, their commission growth tends to grow more slowly in periods of high volatility. After quarter end, the back to back closings of two industry transactions meant fewer competitors in the space. We continue to see opportunity in this area. With fewer competitors, it is easier to get visibility when both new and existing [FAs] research their platform options, especially when they hear about new fees, learn about hidden fees and potentially find themselves competing against their broker.  Our final segment is introducing brokers. These represent 30% of our accounts, 29% of our client equity and 12% of our 12 month commissions. Our brokers segment account growth was 38% for the latest 12 months with 86% client equity growth and 71% in commissions. We saw growth in this segment in all regions with Asia showing particular strength. Because we offer global markets and products along with seamless back office functionality, we can grow in regions where customers may not be large enough to draw the attention of bulge bracket banks, or even if they did, would be charged extremely high prices for international access.  In 2020, as more people worldwide sought to invest or to diversify their assets, they wanted the ability to access many markets and products in their search for returns and asset safety.  Turning to new products, offerings this quarter included our new Impact Dashboard, which helps investors evaluate the portfolios so they can make adjustments and invest in companies whose ESG worldviews correspond with our own. As ESG investing grows in importance and in assets allocated, Impact Dashboard allows our clients to select the principles and practices most important to them. And then see how each individual investment in their portfolio moves them closer to or farther from their goals. Our mutual fund marketplace has grown to over 34,000 no-load mutual funds from over 285 fund families, making Interactive Brokers one of the largest, if not the largest fund agnostic supermarkets. As always, we do not charge a custody fee and the funds can be accessed by our clients at over 200 countries and territories. We have been spending more on advertising and continue to see good response to our digital marketing efforts. In fact, Google AdWords is using Interactive Brokers as a case study in successful digital marketing efforts. For years, ever since we started our electronic broker in 1993, our dream was 1 million accounts. And sometime within the next week, we will welcome our 1 millionth client. Our goal now is to achieve 80 million accounts or 1% of the global population. To do this in 20 years would be a 25% annual growth rate. To do this in 10 years is the 55% growth rate. There is 1 country today where Interactive Brokers has a nearly 1% share of the population, clearly indicating that 1% or 80 million worldwide is not an impossible dream. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul? Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we'll be putting up a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we'll talk to you next quarter end."

            "name": "Rich Repetto",
            "content": "So first question, Thomas, is trying to put sort of a quantity around or quantify the risk of the EU and not getting the broker approval. Is there any way you can talk about potentially how it could impact either revenue or DARTs if you didn't get certain brokers approved? Because -- I'm assuming because the other existing accounts could still continue to trade. Another question. The margin loans have dramatically increased since they bottomed in March at a little bit over $30 billion and sort of roughly flat with sort of the higher quarters of last year. But I guess my question, can you see the margin loan balances -- given that accounts have grown by 50%, and the best of our ability, the account quality, when it looks like -- when you look at average client equity or average trading, it's still the same. So are you -- could you expect to see a improvement in people starting to lever up more? Yes. Yes. Expected volatility here. I guess, my last question is, Thomas, if I got the math down right, the selling at 20,000 per day is around 5 -- a little bit over 5 million shares a year. I think over the 60-year period, you'd be a young at 130. So if you are doing this to manage a state and the other reasons you noted at the beginning of the call, would you ever, at some point, entertain selling your asset books? Alright. Okay. Okay. That's the goal of this selling."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Thomas Peterffy",
            "content": "Good afternoon. Early last year, I spoke about what is going to happen to my Interactive Brokers shares. As I said at that time and repeat now, I'm a firm believer in the long-term success of this company. And I'm a reluctant seller, but must recognize the two issues I'm frequently asked about. One is the small float that scares away a large would be purchasers of the stock. And second is, the taxes on that, that I could -- that could force liquidation. In order to show some movement to deal with these two issues, but also to keep holding on to most of my stock, I just started selling program that would dispose of the shares gradually over the next 60-years. I will implement a trading program that sells 20,000 shares on each business day.  As our average daily volume is roughly 600,000 shares, these shares are not expected to have much of an impact on the price. I will start the daily sales of 20,000 shares every business day, trying to achieve the daily VWAP. I have been approached by several potential investors and brokers who offered to buy a block of stock, but my answer is always the same, and it will remain the same. If you want the stock, you need to buy it in the open market.  The second is Brexit. As a global broker, we operate in legal and regulatory environment of many localities, countries and regions. On this ever shifting landscape, we finally must adapt our operations, including our corporate structure and operating licenses to continue servicing our existing and new clients at high levels. This is a particular focus in Europe, in the context of Brexit. UK and EU negotiations have been ongoing for several years with more than a few changes in direction, and postponements of the effective date. If the current withdrawal agreement is onward, Brexit will become effective on December 31st of this year. As we conduct our European business primarily through our UK broker, and to a lesser extent, through our Luxembourg broker, we have applied for additional licenses in Europe, through our affiliates Interactive Brokers Ireland and Interactive Brokers Central Europe. While we have been at this effort for some time, our license applications are pending for both affiliates, and we think it's quite possible that one or both is still being progressed on December 31st. While the outcome depends on many factors, including regulatory flexibility and interpretations, it is possible that we will be facing a temporary gap during which we could be unable to fully service some EU customers for a short period of time, subsequent to the year-end which could negatively impact our business in Europe. We think that any delay in our ability to service affected EU clients or open new accounts would be limited and temporary.  The third item is margins. Much has been made of our recently announced policy to slowly increase certain margin requirements in the run-up to the election. Given the uncertainty over the market during this time, we believe this is the correct prudent step to take to protect our costumers and ourselves. We have given more than sufficient notice of our intention and we are implementing the increase very gradually and do not see any major issues.  And now back to you, Nancy. I don't think that the impact would be noticeable. It would only -- I think it would be only noticeable to the extent of opening new accounts. And there you're trading. So I don't expect that it will make much of a noticeable impact in the numbers. That's right. I do expect that but you must consider the fact that, number one, many of the new accounts are less of the professional trader type that we originally had and more of the investor type, so they tend to use less margin. And second, we have tightened up many of our requirements because of understandable reasons, right? All I have to sell is enough to pay the tax, right, when I die, right? Between now and then I die, I have to sign up to pay the tax at that time, right? That's right. So the effort to get a bank charter got side tracked at the time when we had the SEC-CFTC findings against us. And so we'll have to digest steps and really prove that we have taken all the necessary steps, and the regulator should be very happy with everything we have done. And so that's probably going to take maybe 2 or 3 more quarters. I think it's November 2. Well, that would be mutual thinking. I don't actually think that it will continue at 50%. But it will continue the portfolio at a fairly high rate. So it's more of the same in the sense that we are investing heavily in automation, more and more in automating customer engagement, watching, having automated facilities that watch our customers and interact with them as -- watch what they are doing and interact with them and telling them about the various options. We have -- they try and are useful of the movement and they do whatever they are doing, that sort of automation. We are certainly going to continue to increase our marketing -- digital marketing expenditure around the world. And so we do hope that we can continue to grow at a very hefty rate, and we're going to invest whatever we can usefully spend in our view in further growth. Well, in the last couple of weeks, we do notice some variation in activity, and -- which would be expected in -- as we come up to the election. And then, of course, I think it will pick up when the results come up, especially if the Senate goes to Democratic, I expect that people will start taking the long-term gains because of the expected 43% long-term capital gains, tax rate. And then of course, we are looking further on the road more and more expanding and that will result in asset inflation, including higher and higher stock prices. So that's not unique to Interactive Brokers. That's going to be just general. The financial services industry will have a fairly good time. We keep trying to expand our margin lending, but without being -- while we remain careful because we don't want to take on new risks. But -- so that's basically certainly a focus. We do not see any -- as you know, we are restricted in how we can invest our money. And we are certainly not looking at lower-grade infrequent, illiquid governments or long-term governments. That's not for us. Haven't thought of special dividends. Paul, this is a question for you. I'm sorry, I -- you were breaking up. I couldn't hear the question. Paul, did you hear? Definitely. We definitely have lots of RIAs that come to kick the tires. They basically want to know that if they wanted to leave, would this be a good place to come to. So for now, it's a lot of work for us with not much business. But maybe, maybe it will materialize. You never know. So we spend a lot of time with these RIAs and then they go away and they say, oh, yes, this is very, very good to know. Thank you very much. Maybe we'll come back. And then this is the last we see them, where they were. I would not -- we wouldn't know that. We wouldn't -- no, I don't think so. No. I think most -- I mean most sophisticated active traders are already with us, I would think. I think it is not sustainable at these levels, but it will certainly not go back to the levels of early in the year. So I think it will probably end up somewhere about halfway in between. That's what I would expect. The AML issue was certainly resolved. We have undertaken a lot of work that we currently have to get done. And that we will get done by the end of the year, which is much earlier than what we agreed to do. But -- so the answer is that the issue is resolved. The work is not finished yet, but it will be by early next year. Yes, it's basically software and the consultants. We have a number of consultants who have imposed various -- would be nice to have ideas and some of which we had accepted, and we're working on getting them done. So we are currently in the process of increasing margin rates. And I think that will -- and I think by the end of this week -- Paul, is that correct? Do I think? So our margin loans are gradually increasing as we speak in spite of the increase in the margin requirements."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Interactive Brokers Group Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Nancy Stuebe. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.\nNancy Stuebe: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. He will handle the Q&A. As a reminder, today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company\u2019s belief regarding future events, which, by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company\u2019s control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. We continue to see strength in our business, as more people in more countries chose to invest in the markets. Accounts rose 36% year-on-year to $876,000, as we added 116 net new accounts in the quarter. In the second quarter, we brought on more new accounts than we\u2019ve ever added in a full year. This quarter\u2019s growth implies an annualized account growth rate of 60%. We saw growth in all client segments and all geographic regions, with areas outside the U.S. particularly strong. Our growth outside the U.S. has become more evenly distributed among countries and regions over the past couple of years. In an active markets environment, this diversification has contributed to our growth, as increasing numbers of investors around the world seek to participate by using our platform. Client equity rows above $200 billion for the first time and ended the quarter up 33% at $203 billion. Over the course of the quarter, clients grew more comfortable with putting money into the market and taking on leverage, leading to client trading levels increasing and our margin loan balances recovering. As clients traded more actively during unusually high market volatility, our total DARTs reached over 1.7 million, more than doubling from last year, and cleared average DARTs per account was 64% to 480. Our platform is highly automated, so adding an additional customer to it costs us very little, and any activity they initiate is profitable for us. That is why we focus on growing our customer base in all segments and regions, so we can take advantage of higher activity in any market scenario. In addition, our platform offers worldwide access and securities, ranging from equities, fixed income, funds, derivatives and FX, among other products. So diversity means, we can capture extra activity regardless of the type of security or the geographic area in which it occurs. However, not everything was as we would have wanted at Interactive Brokers this quarter. As we announced in April, our systems did not perform as we would have wanted during the extreme price movements around the WTI index on April 20. Both the CME and ICE Europe used the price of physically-settled oil futures to determine the settlement price for their cash-settled futures products. Historically, that mismatch between physical settlement and cash settlement had not been a problem. However, on April 20, worries over the lack of availability of oil storage drove the price of the physical oil futures deep into unprecedented negative territory. So even though the cash-settled contract would, of course, not have to face this issue, the CME and ICE pricing mechanisms meant they were priced as if they did. Several of our customers held long positions in the cash-settled CME and ICE contracts. And as a result, they incurred losses, some in excess of the equity in their accounts. We fulfilled all the required settlements with the various clearing houses and felt it right to compensate certain affected customers in connection with their losses. All told, our aggregate loss was $104 million. Since then, we have successfully programmed and tested our systems to ensure such an event does not impact us like this again. Further, we tightened some parameters around the trading of oil futures. Aside from this event and despite extremely high market volatility this quarter, our bad debt expense was a modest $2 million. On interest rates, the new zero and negative interest rate regimes in the U.S. and around the world have impacted our net interest income. Higher margin loans and influx of cash into new and existing customer accounts and a strong securities finance performance led to $190 million of net interest income for the quarter, despite our segregated cash and securities yielding only 34 basis points. We have already seen the bulk of the impact of the Federal Reserve\u2019s move to zero rates on the segregated cash and securities interest rates. Though if rates hold steady, there could be further declines as our longer-term holdings mature. Finally, our total equity reached over $8.25 billion in the second quarter, our highest to date. With no debt, our balance sheet remains strong. As we continue to grow and larger \u2013 as we continue to grow and add larger and institutional accounts, our equity capital helps us attract these investors \u2013 these customers. We saw growth in all five of the client types that we service. I will now go over our five client segments. Individual customers, which made up 55% of our accounts, 36% of our client equity and 52% of our commissions, continue to be our fastest-growing segment, with 12-month account growth of 50%, client equity growth of 35%, and 30% growth in latest 12 month\u2019s commissions. All geographic regions we serve saw growth over 30%, with Europe and Asia continuing to grow faster than the Americas for now. Once again, this demonstrates investor demand for a reliable platform with a wide choice of products in international markets, which can maximize investment opportunities. Interactive Brokers is a stay-at-home company, so individuals now that they have the time to do so, want to invest and manage their money. Proprietary trading firms are 2% of our accounts, 11% of our client equity, and 15% of commissions. This group grew accounts 19% for the 12-month period, 40% in client equity and 28% in commissions. As prop trading firms are sensitive to the direction of volatility, this quarter sustained high volatility offered them numerous opportunities. Prop traders tend to have more active trading strategies, which benefit from our low-cost platform that provides access to securities around the globe. We continue to see growth in the hedge fund customer segment. For the 12 months ended June 30, we saw 4% hedge fund account growth, 18% customer equity growth and 11% commission growth. This segment was particularly strong in the Americas and Asia this quarter. Growing word of mouth, a reputation for best price execution and low-margin rates and the quality of our platform are behind this growth. Hedge funds represent 1% of our accounts, 8% of our client equity, and 8% of our commissions. Financial advisors are 13% of our accounts, 19% of our customer equity, and 14% of our commissions. This group grew accounts by 11% for the 12-month period, while customer equity grows 11% and commissions 6%. As advisors tend to be more conservative in their activity, their commission growth tends to grow more slowly in periods of high volatility. Our final segment is introducing brokers. These represent 30% of our accounts, 26% of our client equity, and 11% of our 12-month commissions. IBroker segment account growth was 27% for the latest 12 months, with 54% client equity growth and 44% in commissions. Introducing brokers build their own businesses under their own name, gather their own customers, create their own marketing and provide their own client service. Interactive Brokers does the back office clearing and processing at low cost. Our ability to offer global markets and products, along with seamless back office functionality, has allowed to grow in regions, where customers may not be large enough to draw the attention of bulge bracket banks, or even if they did, would be charged extremely high prices for international access. We have seen that as more people worldwide seek to trade on recent market volatility or to diversify their assets, they want to be able to access many markets and products. Turning to new products. New offerings this quarter included our securities class action recovery service and automated solution we created to relieve our clients of the administrative burden of recovering amounts due them from a securities class action lawsuit; a shortable instruments tool, the clients can search for availability and rates for shortable stocks and bonds directly from their client portal; a redesigned fundamentals explorer tool, giving our clients access to Thomson Reuters fundamental data on over 30,000 companies for free; attacks optimizer tool, so clients can both try out different lot matching methods to optimize the trades cost basis and analyze their long-term and short-term gains or losses; and finally, margin borrowing in Australia for both individual and corporate retail customers. We continue to see better responses from our digital marketing efforts since year-end, a development we hope will continue. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter.\nPaul Brody: Thank you, Nancy. Welcome, everyone, to the call. Thanks for joining. As usual, I\u2019ll first review our operating results and non-core items, and my comments will follow the format of the earnings release. And after that, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we began reporting without separate business segments as our remaining market-making activity is no longer material to our overall results. At that time, we also separated two line items, other fees and services from other income. Other features and services contains recurring items, such as market data fees and FDIC Bank Sweep Program income, while other income consists of currency impacts, U.S. Treasury marks to market, principal trading activities and other investment gains or losses that are less predictable in nature. The operating metrics reflected continued record levels of trading and account openings in a persistent high volatility environment. The continued global impact of the coronavirus was a likely contributor to the highly active markets worldwide. Volatility, as measured by the average VIX, more than doubled to 34.9% in the current quarter from 15.2% in the same quarter last year. However, the current quarter was more consistently volatile in the first quarter of 2020 when the VIX spiked to over 82% for a short time in March. This quarter, the VIX ranged from 24.5% to 57%, reflecting consistently active markets. Quarterly total DARTs increased 111% to a record $1.75 million, compared to the second quarter of 2019. Our customer trade volumes continue to rise dramatically in every product class, led by increases of 64%, 34%, and 63% in options, futures and stocks, respectively. FX dollar volumes were strong as well increasing 55%. Total accounts reached 876,000, up 36% over the prior year, with quarterly net new accounts added at a pace five times higher than last year\u2019s second quarter. This contributed to customer equity growth of 33% to $203.2 billion at quarter-end. Our average \u2013 our overall average cleared commission per commissionable order fell 24% versus last year to $2.81. On a product mix, that featured smaller average trade sizes in stocks, futures and FX and slightly larger in option. Smaller trade sizes are often seen in high volatility periods, as traders choose to risk less per trade in fast-moving markets. Moving to our net interest margin table. Our net interest margin narrowed from 1.66% to 0.99%. In five separate actions since the year-ago quarter, the Federal Reserve brought its benchmark target rate down to near zero. The average effective Fed funds rate, which we used to price our margin loans and interest paid on customer cash, fell from 2.4% in the second quarter of 2019 to 0.06% in the second quarter of 2020. While this significantly lowered what we paid on our customer credit balances, it also reduced our earnings on segregated cash and margin loan. Nevertheless, our net interest margin narrowed just 67 basis points over this period, supported by successful segregated cash management and strong securities lending. Despite the Fed lowering the overnight interest rate, the yield curve remained flat as it has for several quarters. We have kept the duration of our portfolio relatively short and recorded a mark-to-market loss of $13 million on our holdings of U.S. Treasuries, making us roughly flat for the year-to-date. As always, we plan to hold these securities to maturity, so any gains and losses on our mark-to-market each quarter should trend towards zero over time. But as brokers, unlike banks, GAAP rules require that we mark our portfolio to market in our financial reporting. Outside the U.S., benchmark interest rates remained near or below zero for many currencies, as Central Banks continue to attempt to soften the impact from COVID-19 on their economy. Despite a 29% increase over the year-ago quarter in customer credit balances, the reduction in our expense of interest paid on these balances was the largest contributor preventing our net interest margin from falling further. We continue to have success in asset gathering and our FDIC insured bank sweep deposit \u2013 Bank Deposit Sweep Program, maintained its steady growth, reaching an average of $3 billion, up nearly 1 billion from last year. Margin lending and securities lending were the largest contributors to our net interest margin. Average margin loan balances fell 13% from last year. However, due to significantly lower benchmark interest rates, margin loan interest income fell 65%. Margin loans have shown a steady bounce back ending the quarter at $25.7 billion, about 13% over the average for the quarter. Securities lending interest income was up 67% this quarter versus the year ago, as we successfully capitalized on more hard to borrow names that investors were looking to short. On segregated cash, despite a 66% increase in segregated cash balances, lower investment rates led to a 73% decline in interest income. Several factors caused the yields on our segregated cash to differ from the change in Fed funds rate. First, a portion is held in other currencies. And second, given an average duration of investment in treasuries of about 35 days, reinvestments take place over time. So some of our investments, segregated cash would not be expected to follow a Fed rate declines immediately. The increase in segregated cash balances is a function of higher customer credit balances and lower margin lending. While investors were more comfortable taking on leverage this quarter, over time, the growth in our clients cash is consistent and outpaces the variable growth and contraction in margin loan. Note too that the FDIC Sweep Program removes funds that would otherwise be included in our segregated cash balances from our balance sheet for accounting purposes. Now for our estimate of the impact of the next 25 basis point increase in rates, when calculating the impact of rate changes, we understand that as the possibility of a future rate increase becomes more certain, this expectation is typically already reflected in the yields of the instruments in which we invest. Therefore, we attempt to isolate the impact of an unexpected rise of fallen rates separate from the impact of rate hikes or cuts that have already been baked into the prices of these instruments. With that assumption, we would expect the next 25 basis points unanticipated rise in rates to produce an additional $96 million in net interest income over the next four quarters and $110 million as the yearly run rate based on our current balance sheet. These numbers are highly sensitive to benchmark rate changes, due to the impact of low rates on the spread between what we earn on our segregated cash and what we pay to our customers. As U.S. rates fell below 50 basis points, our spread compressed as we earn less when investing our segregated cash. However, the converse is also true that as rates move back up towards 50 basis points, our spread expands significantly. The run rate includes the reinvestment of all of our present holdings at the new assumed rate, but does not take into account any change in how we manage our segregated cash. If we are successful in continuing to grow our customer assets, higher cash and margin lending balances will provide some offset to the loss of net interest income from low benchmark rates, should they persist. Turning to our income statement. As I mentioned earlier, in 2020, we began reporting our consolidated numbers only and no longer report segment. We define non-core items as those not part of our fundamental operating result. Non-core items include four items this quarter. First, our currency diversification strategy produced a gain of $16 million versus $6 million loss last year; second, a mark-to-market loss on U.S. government securities of $13 million versus a gain of $5 million last year; third, a gain on our investments of $13 million versus a loss of $74 million last year; and finally, an unusual customer expense of $104 million on the WTI event versus no equivalent in the year-ago quarter. The net effect of these adjustments reduced pre-tax income by $88 million this year \u2013 this year\u2019s quarter and by $75 million last year\u2019s quarter. Net revenues were a reported $539 million for the quarter, up 31% versus last year\u2019s second quarter. Excluding non-core items, net revenue was up 7% to $523 million. Commission revenue rose 55% on significantly higher volumes in all product categories. Net interest income fell 24% to $196 million, largely due to the drop in average effective Fed funds rate versus the year-ago quarter. Other fees and services revenues rose 14% to $40 million. These include market data, exposure, account activity and FDIC Bank Sweep Program fees, as well as fees generated from facilitating customers\u2019 participation in IPO. Other income, which include gains and losses on our investments and currency strategy as well as principal transaction was $27 million versus a $59 million loss last year, Ex-non-core items, other income decreased 31% to $11 million. Non-interest expenses were $317 million for the quarter, up 69% from last year. Adjusting this year for the cost of the unusual WTI event, non-interest expenses were up 13%, due primarily to higher execution and clearing costs, in line with higher trade volumes and to higher employee compensation and benefits costs. At quarter-end, our total headcount stood at 1,815, a 19% increase over last year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of our employees worldwide have been working remotely. After a brief pause in the first quarter, we have been hiring again to keep up with the influx of new accounts and to strengthen client services, compliance and systems development for the future. Fixed expenses were $238 million, up 97%, primarily due to the unusual WTI event. Without it, fixed expenses were $135 million, up 12%, driven by higher compensation and benefits, in line with the hiring that supports our growing business, as well as some increase in occupancy and G&A expenses. And in April, we donated $5 million to assist efforts to provide food and support for people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, as well as to advance medical solutions. Ex the WTI loss, customer bad debt expense was $2 million, down 50% from last year and well contained despite the dramatic increase in activity and volatility. Reported pre-tax income was $222 million, down 1% for a 41% margin. Excluding non-core items, pre-tax income was $310 million, up 3% for a 59% pre-tax margin. Diluted earnings per share were $0.40 for the quarter versus $0.43 for the same period in 2019 and ex non-core items diluted earnings per share were $0.57, unchanged from last year as adjusted. To help investors better understand our earnings, taxes and the split between public shareholders and the non-controlling interest, the second quarter numbers are as follows. Starting with our unadjusted pre-tax income of $222 million, we deduct $7 million for income taxes paid by our operating companies, which are mostly foreign taxes. This leaves $215 million, of which 81.4%, or that $175 million reported on our income statement is attributable to non-controlling interest. The remaining 18.6%, or $40 million is available for the public company shareholders. But as this is a non-GAAP measure, it is not reported on our income statement. After we expense remaining taxes of $8 million owed on that $40 million, the public company\u2019s net income available for common stockholders is the $32 million you see reported on our income statement. Our income tax expense of $15 million consists of this $8 million, plus the $7 million of taxes paid by the operating company. Turning to the balance sheet with $8.25 billion in consolidated equity, we\u2019re well-capitalized from a regulatory standpoint. We deploy our strong capital base toward opportunities to grow our brokerage business worldwide, as well as to emphasize the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners. We continue to carry no long-term debt. And at June 30, margin loans were $25.7 billion, about even with last year, but up 28% from March 31, as clients increased leverage over the quarter. We continue to expect swings in margin lending balances, reflecting both economic conditions and our success in attracting institutional customers who are more opportunistic in taking on leverage. We offer the lowest margin lending rates of our competitors. And as we expand our customer base, we remain well-positioned to satisfy our customers\u2019 risk appetite. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the moderator and we will take some questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nRichard Repetto: Yes, good evening, Tom. Good evening, Paul and Nancy. So I guess, my question \u2013 first question is really for Paul, I think, on the net interest income. The customer credit of being a positive $6 million. Could you \u2013 that\u2019s historically been a negative number. Can you just walk through that? And I guess, also sort of the outlook for \u2013 but you talked about $150 million sort of floor last quarter. Could you just talk about maybe the runoff rate or outlook for NII going forward here?\nPaul Brody: Sure. So to your first question, and that\u2019s a good observation. So, yes, the number was actually positive on a customer credit balances, because the benchmark rates have fallen so low, primarily in the U.S. that our standard credit rate to customers, which is Fed funds less 50 basis points, ordinarily a very tight spread, is now zero. So all of those customer credits earned zero at the moment at these benchmark rates. And there are some non-U.S. dollar currencies such \u2013 in particular, euros, which are at negative rates and some of their customers get a pass-through rate, which results in a small net income on all of the currency balances.\nRichard Repetto: Okay. Anything on the outlook for net interest income\u2026\nPaul Brody: Yes.\nRichard Repetto: \u2026the roll off of treasury and so forth?\nPaul Brody: So we\u2019re probably not far off from what Thomas indicated in the first quarter. So the second quarter $201 million net interest income, we have \u2013 if rates don\u2019t change at all, we have a little ways to go in terms of the rollover of current investments that will roll over at somewhat lower rates. And our estimate is that could be another $40 million or so reduction, but only if all the other factors stay the same. And, of course, what we\u2019ve seen is pretty strong growth in credit balances as we\u2019ve taken on new customers and new deposits, so forth, but also quite a strong bounce back in the margin debit. There is \u2013 people are definitely taking on leverage again. And if that continues, those numbers will be better.\nRichard Repetto: Okay. And then last question is for Thomas. You had phenomenal account growth, great growth in margin balances and activity levels. And I guess, the question is, has that \u2013in really over every \u2013 each month of the quarter, the account growth, again, just really off the map. So could you just talk about the momentum? Is the momentum still continuing so far in July, and everything that we\u2019ve heard about China, has that helped in the growth of accounts sort of in Asia or Hong Kong in July to date?\nThomas Peterffy: So, historically, we have an account growth rate of slightly over 20%. This quarter, we had \u2013 we saw 60%. We do not expect that to continue. I think, eventually, we\u2019re going to go back to somewhere in the low-20s. And \u2013 but that will be on an ever-increasing base. So the number of accounts will \u2013 there\u2019ll be more and more accounts added every quarter, more and more additional accounts, right?\nPaul Brody: Yes.\nThomas Peterffy: If you want to know what happened so far this month, only 20 days have passed. I wouldn\u2019t want to speculate about the next 10. So watch the monthly releases, please\u2026\nRichard Repetto: Okay.\nThomas Peterffy: \u2026if you are that curious.\nRichard Repetto: Understood. Thank you very much. Understood.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you. Good evening, everyone. As we look at the impressive growth rates across both client equity and accounts, can you provide perspective on the contribution by geography, including Asia beyond the 30%-plus figure that you just gave us in the prepared commentary?\nThomas Peterffy: So, as we said previously, geography has more rounded out in the sense that where we had experienced very high rates previously, it moderated and where we had experienced relatively lower rates of increase, the rate has increased. So our lowest rates geography-wise is China, number one and the U.S. number two. And our highest rates are the outskirts of China and Eastern Europe, South America, Canada, et cetera.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Thomas. I have one follow-up maybe for Paul. How should we think about changes to the share count over the next year as they look at the 2% inflation number for the quarter?\nPaul Brody: I\u2019m sorry. Did you say share count?\nCraig Siegenthaler: Yes.\nPaul Brody: So historically, our share count has increased regularly every year, as our employee stock incentive plan vests and those shares become part of the public shares, that\u2019s the primary reason. And then also historically, there has been an opportunity for the holders of the \u2013 what\u2019s known as a non-controlling interest in the financial statement to effectively redeem that interest for public shares and that has also increased the flow. But as you can see, we went \u2013 we IPOed in 2007 with 10%, and it\u2019s at 18% and change now. So that tells you something about the pace at which that takes place generally.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Nance from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now.\nWill Nance: Hey, guys, good afternoon. Maybe I\u2019ll start with one for Thomas another one on the account growth. So can you just \u2013 clearly, something across the world is driving a massive increase in account growth, regardless of geography. So can you just kind of talk about what is the biggest contributor to the growth and what are the customers that you\u2019re bringing on? What do they look like compared to your average IB customer in terms of account size or activity just to get a sense for the types of people who are kind of being brought into the market in the type of environment that we\u2019re in?\nThomas Peterffy: So the strongest growth we\u2019re experiencing from individual customers, as you can see that our individual customers have \u2013 now constitute varies by sheet. Our individual customers now constitute, I think, 55% of our account. And about two years ago, there were at 50%. So as far as the size of the accounts, they remain relatively the same. So what happens is that, when people open account, they open it with very little money, and then they tend to add and add and add. So while the average account opens up, let\u2019s say, probably $60,000, by the time they are with us for two years, they are roughly $200,000.\nWill Nance: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe a follow-up on something Paul said earlier on the kind of follow through from the impact of rates. Just a question on that $40 million, [ph] Like the seg cash line for an EBITDA of 34 basis points this quarter, I guess, maybe a more straightforward question like where do you expect that to kind of land once we get through all of the repricing of some of your longer-dated assets? And I guess, is that the primary? You put in $40 million of interest income from that line, are you suggesting that it\u2019s going to go to zero next quarter, or I\u2019m just trying to kind of contextualize that number?\nPaul Brody: Right. So I mean, again, depending on a number of assumptions, primarily at the rates either stay up zero or go to zero, the U.S. rates aren\u2019t \u2013 are not effectively at zero. They have been in the 15 basis points, plus or minus for a while. So my number was based on all of that going at 15 basis points.\nWill Nance: Got it. So 15 basis points kind of where you expected to land. That\u2019s very helpful. And then maybe just a big picture one on, I think, previously, there have been something out there about you guys applying for a U.S. Bank charter. Can you just kind of update where you are in the process of that? And I guess, does the lower level of rates make you rethink the client cash strategy and maybe evaluating opportunities to find kind of better sources of yield by using a bank subsidiary in the U.S.?\nThomas Peterffy: So this is a long-term gain, and we expect that eventually interest will go back up. And so on the long-term, we definitely want to have the bank. But our immediate enthusiasm in view of the lower rates that definitely \u2013 have definitely cooled. So we are still doing it, but we are not doing it with the same rapid desire as we did it before. So it\u2019s going forward, but slower.\nWill Nance: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen from Compass Point. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Allen: Evening, everyone. I wanted to ask a little bit on the stock lending business. Obviously, a very nice pickup. I was just wondering if there was a decent breadth to the business just in terms of a wide number of stocks or was just focused on just a few? And just trying to think about how the trajectory is for that moving forward?\nPaul Brody: So it\u2019s a very broad base for us. We have a lot of customers, obviously, and a lot of holdings. And so there\u2019s a base of that income that tends to rise and I say tends to, because the market conditions often determine how short customers want to be, how much risk they want to take on, et cetera, if they buy stocks on margin, they become available to be used in securities lending market. So there is a broad base that is generally increasing for us as our customer base increases. Having said that, as I\u2019ve said before, that business is sensitive to the opportunities that come up with some well-known names that you, I\u2019m sure, probably following that you \u2013 that become hot stocks from time to time, meaning that the short interest is enough and the availability is not prevalent. And so the cost of securities lending goes up. And if our customers are long and we\u2019re able to lend those shares out into the marketplace, they generate a lot more income than the run-of-the-mill stocks. So we\u2019ve spent lots of our development \u2013 software development efforts over the years to be able to hone our skills in taking advantage when those rates present themselves. And so that\u2019s a lot of what you see from quarter-to-quarter in terms of the opportunities. But we have \u2013 we built our systems and, of course, our team to take advantage of those when they arise.\nChristopher Allen: And then just a quick one on expenses. I mean, taking \u2013 putting aside the bad debt expense and the COVID donation seems like most areas were in line with expectations. Employee comp is rising a decent amount from a year-over-year perspective. It seems like headcount is on the rise though, and the typical drivers of that counter in place. Are you seeing any competitive pressure in terms of cost of developers or any other factors that we need to contemplate in terms of the expense trajectory moving forward?\nPaul Brody: I don\u2019t think we\u2019re seeing any particular competitive pressures. As a matter of fact, there\u2019s some evidence that since the COVID situation and work at home and the uncertainty in many industries and the layoffs and so forth, I think, we\u2019ve actually seen an opening up of supply, if you will, of highly qualified people and we\u2019ve somewhat taking advantage of that. And then, of course, we continue to build up our operations in India in client services and software development, and we can \u2013 we manage to find quite qualified people there and, of course, that\u2019s at a lower cost.\nChristopher Allen: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is now open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe I guess a follow-up on Will\u2019s earlier question on the strong new account \u2013 new accounts and the clients. Just wondering if these new clients are more active traders, or a materially different age compared with your current client base when you compare it to kind of the clients that you had to start the year? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense if the clients are more or less profitable than your kind of starting base of clients?\nThomas Peterffy: Yes. So our average client age is, I think, it\u2019s 46. And the \u2013 maybe they are a couple of years younger. So they are slightly younger. That \u2013 but as far as the tendency to trade, it\u2019s roughly the same.\nKyle Voigt: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just another question on \u2013 there\u2019s a large brokerage transaction that\u2019s likely to close in the coming months in your sector. So just wondering if you see any opportunity there in terms of potentially capturing some active traders or advisors or other clients. I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any interest in increasing your marketing spend or anything to try to go after that opportunity?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, there are a number of RIAs who are expressing interest, who \u2013 most of them used to have accounts with Schwab and with Ameritrade. And they are not \u2013 since they don\u2019t want to have all their eggs in one basket, they are now beginning to inquire about having some of their accounts with us. And the second complaint, if I could call it that is that, some folks have gone from Schwab to Ameritrade and some went from Ameritrade to Schwab. And they are saying, no, I don\u2019t want to be back to where I moved away from. So \u2013 and there is one more item, which is that some believe that Schwab is actively competing against independent RIAs by their own internal RIAs.\nKyle Voigt: That\u2019s interesting. So do you think \u2013 is there a general timeframe where you think that it\u2019s going to take for these RIAs to potentially start moving assets over? Or are you in the process already in opening accounts, or\u2026?\nThomas Peterffy: It\u2019s already happening.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. That\u2019s good color. Thank you, Thomas. Last one for Paul is just on execution and clearing fees. I think, they were down from the 1Q levels. Sorry, if I missed that, just wondering what drove that, despite the higher trading volumes?\nPaul Brody: Well, there\u2019s always a mix of the product mix and that it\u2019s highly variable in terms of \u2013 in certain products if the customer orders happened to be providing liquidity, maybe that\u2019s a lower fee, maybe even a rebate, and so forth. So higher volume doesn\u2019t translate exactly into higher execution and clearing costs. Volumes were up and costs are about the same this time.\nKyle Voigt: Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nRichard Repetto: Yes. Hi, guys. Just a follow-up here. Paul, I just wanted to clarify this. When you talked about net interest income, you said the minus $40 million, all in seg \u2013 coming from seg cash, I thought you said, holding all other things being equal. So that line, it, I believe, only generated $40 million to begin with, and you\u2019re saying that the rate from 34 basis points to 15 cut by a little bit more than half. So we are incorporating other things into to get to your number or just trying to get more what you were pulling in to come up with that, that number?\nPaul Brody: Well, it\u2019s primarily reinvestment at lower rates. But there\u2019s some effect coming from, say, margin loans that are still \u2013 would have some room to come down, because they\u2019re not at our best year, right? So our best \u2013 currently, our best year is a minimum of 75 basis points. But to the extent that some loans are being charged more than that, those would come down a bit, so it\u2019s a combination of several factors.\nRichard Repetto: Okay, all right. Okay, that\u2019s all I had. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I\u2019m showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Nancy Stuebe for closing remarks.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website and we\u2019ll be putting up a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you, again, and we will talk to you next quarter-end.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nancy Stuebe",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. He will handle the Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which, by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. We continue to see strength in our business, as more people in more countries chose to invest in the markets. Accounts rose 36% year-on-year to $876,000, as we added 116 net new accounts in the quarter. In the second quarter, we brought on more new accounts than we've ever added in a full year. This quarter's growth implies an annualized account growth rate of 60%. We saw growth in all client segments and all geographic regions, with areas outside the U.S. particularly strong. Our growth outside the U.S. has become more evenly distributed among countries and regions over the past couple of years. In an active markets environment, this diversification has contributed to our growth, as increasing numbers of investors around the world seek to participate by using our platform. Client equity rows above $200 billion for the first time and ended the quarter up 33% at $203 billion. Over the course of the quarter, clients grew more comfortable with putting money into the market and taking on leverage, leading to client trading levels increasing and our margin loan balances recovering. As clients traded more actively during unusually high market volatility, our total DARTs reached over 1.7 million, more than doubling from last year, and cleared average DARTs per account was 64% to 480. Our platform is highly automated, so adding an additional customer to it costs us very little, and any activity they initiate is profitable for us. That is why we focus on growing our customer base in all segments and regions, so we can take advantage of higher activity in any market scenario. In addition, our platform offers worldwide access and securities, ranging from equities, fixed income, funds, derivatives and FX, among other products. So diversity means, we can capture extra activity regardless of the type of security or the geographic area in which it occurs. However, not everything was as we would have wanted at Interactive Brokers this quarter. As we announced in April, our systems did not perform as we would have wanted during the extreme price movements around the WTI index on April 20. Both the CME and ICE Europe used the price of physically-settled oil futures to determine the settlement price for their cash-settled futures products. Historically, that mismatch between physical settlement and cash settlement had not been a problem. However, on April 20, worries over the lack of availability of oil storage drove the price of the physical oil futures deep into unprecedented negative territory. So even though the cash-settled contract would, of course, not have to face this issue, the CME and ICE pricing mechanisms meant they were priced as if they did. Several of our customers held long positions in the cash-settled CME and ICE contracts. And as a result, they incurred losses, some in excess of the equity in their accounts. We fulfilled all the required settlements with the various clearing houses and felt it right to compensate certain affected customers in connection with their losses. All told, our aggregate loss was $104 million. Since then, we have successfully programmed and tested our systems to ensure such an event does not impact us like this again. Further, we tightened some parameters around the trading of oil futures. Aside from this event and despite extremely high market volatility this quarter, our bad debt expense was a modest $2 million. On interest rates, the new zero and negative interest rate regimes in the U.S. and around the world have impacted our net interest income. Higher margin loans and influx of cash into new and existing customer accounts and a strong securities finance performance led to $190 million of net interest income for the quarter, despite our segregated cash and securities yielding only 34 basis points. We have already seen the bulk of the impact of the Federal Reserve's move to zero rates on the segregated cash and securities interest rates. Though if rates hold steady, there could be further declines as our longer-term holdings mature. Finally, our total equity reached over $8.25 billion in the second quarter, our highest to date. With no debt, our balance sheet remains strong. As we continue to grow and larger \u2013 as we continue to grow and add larger and institutional accounts, our equity capital helps us attract these investors \u2013 these customers. We saw growth in all five of the client types that we service. I will now go over our five client segments. Individual customers, which made up 55% of our accounts, 36% of our client equity and 52% of our commissions, continue to be our fastest-growing segment, with 12-month account growth of 50%, client equity growth of 35%, and 30% growth in latest 12 month's commissions. All geographic regions we serve saw growth over 30%, with Europe and Asia continuing to grow faster than the Americas for now. Once again, this demonstrates investor demand for a reliable platform with a wide choice of products in international markets, which can maximize investment opportunities. Interactive Brokers is a stay-at-home company, so individuals now that they have the time to do so, want to invest and manage their money. Proprietary trading firms are 2% of our accounts, 11% of our client equity, and 15% of commissions. This group grew accounts 19% for the 12-month period, 40% in client equity and 28% in commissions. As prop trading firms are sensitive to the direction of volatility, this quarter sustained high volatility offered them numerous opportunities. Prop traders tend to have more active trading strategies, which benefit from our low-cost platform that provides access to securities around the globe. We continue to see growth in the hedge fund customer segment. For the 12 months ended June 30, we saw 4% hedge fund account growth, 18% customer equity growth and 11% commission growth. This segment was particularly strong in the Americas and Asia this quarter. Growing word of mouth, a reputation for best price execution and low-margin rates and the quality of our platform are behind this growth. Hedge funds represent 1% of our accounts, 8% of our client equity, and 8% of our commissions. Financial advisors are 13% of our accounts, 19% of our customer equity, and 14% of our commissions. This group grew accounts by 11% for the 12-month period, while customer equity grows 11% and commissions 6%. As advisors tend to be more conservative in their activity, their commission growth tends to grow more slowly in periods of high volatility. Our final segment is introducing brokers. These represent 30% of our accounts, 26% of our client equity, and 11% of our 12-month commissions. IBroker segment account growth was 27% for the latest 12 months, with 54% client equity growth and 44% in commissions. Introducing brokers build their own businesses under their own name, gather their own customers, create their own marketing and provide their own client service. Interactive Brokers does the back office clearing and processing at low cost. Our ability to offer global markets and products, along with seamless back office functionality, has allowed to grow in regions, where customers may not be large enough to draw the attention of bulge bracket banks, or even if they did, would be charged extremely high prices for international access. We have seen that as more people worldwide seek to trade on recent market volatility or to diversify their assets, they want to be able to access many markets and products. Turning to new products. New offerings this quarter included our securities class action recovery service and automated solution we created to relieve our clients of the administrative burden of recovering amounts due them from a securities class action lawsuit; a shortable instruments tool, the clients can search for availability and rates for shortable stocks and bonds directly from their client portal; a redesigned fundamentals explorer tool, giving our clients access to Thomson Reuters fundamental data on over 30,000 companies for free; attacks optimizer tool, so clients can both try out different lot matching methods to optimize the trades cost basis and analyze their long-term and short-term gains or losses; and finally, margin borrowing in Australia for both individual and corporate retail customers. We continue to see better responses from our digital marketing efforts since year-end, a development we hope will continue. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website and we'll be putting up a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you, again, and we will talk to you next quarter-end."

            "name": "Paul Brody",
            "content": "Thank you, Nancy. Welcome, everyone, to the call. Thanks for joining. As usual, I'll first review our operating results and non-core items, and my comments will follow the format of the earnings release. And after that, we'll open up the call for questions. As a reminder, in the first quarter, we began reporting without separate business segments as our remaining market-making activity is no longer material to our overall results. At that time, we also separated two line items, other fees and services from other income. Other features and services contains recurring items, such as market data fees and FDIC Bank Sweep Program income, while other income consists of currency impacts, U.S. Treasury marks to market, principal trading activities and other investment gains or losses that are less predictable in nature. The operating metrics reflected continued record levels of trading and account openings in a persistent high volatility environment. The continued global impact of the coronavirus was a likely contributor to the highly active markets worldwide. Volatility, as measured by the average VIX, more than doubled to 34.9% in the current quarter from 15.2% in the same quarter last year. However, the current quarter was more consistently volatile in the first quarter of 2020 when the VIX spiked to over 82% for a short time in March. This quarter, the VIX ranged from 24.5% to 57%, reflecting consistently active markets. Quarterly total DARTs increased 111% to a record $1.75 million, compared to the second quarter of 2019. Our customer trade volumes continue to rise dramatically in every product class, led by increases of 64%, 34%, and 63% in options, futures and stocks, respectively. FX dollar volumes were strong as well increasing 55%. Total accounts reached 876,000, up 36% over the prior year, with quarterly net new accounts added at a pace five times higher than last year's second quarter. This contributed to customer equity growth of 33% to $203.2 billion at quarter-end. Our average \u2013 our overall average cleared commission per commissionable order fell 24% versus last year to $2.81. On a product mix, that featured smaller average trade sizes in stocks, futures and FX and slightly larger in option. Smaller trade sizes are often seen in high volatility periods, as traders choose to risk less per trade in fast-moving markets. Moving to our net interest margin table. Our net interest margin narrowed from 1.66% to 0.99%. In five separate actions since the year-ago quarter, the Federal Reserve brought its benchmark target rate down to near zero. The average effective Fed funds rate, which we used to price our margin loans and interest paid on customer cash, fell from 2.4% in the second quarter of 2019 to 0.06% in the second quarter of 2020. While this significantly lowered what we paid on our customer credit balances, it also reduced our earnings on segregated cash and margin loan. Nevertheless, our net interest margin narrowed just 67 basis points over this period, supported by successful segregated cash management and strong securities lending. Despite the Fed lowering the overnight interest rate, the yield curve remained flat as it has for several quarters. We have kept the duration of our portfolio relatively short and recorded a mark-to-market loss of $13 million on our holdings of U.S. Treasuries, making us roughly flat for the year-to-date. As always, we plan to hold these securities to maturity, so any gains and losses on our mark-to-market each quarter should trend towards zero over time. But as brokers, unlike banks, GAAP rules require that we mark our portfolio to market in our financial reporting. Outside the U.S., benchmark interest rates remained near or below zero for many currencies, as Central Banks continue to attempt to soften the impact from COVID-19 on their economy. Despite a 29% increase over the year-ago quarter in customer credit balances, the reduction in our expense of interest paid on these balances was the largest contributor preventing our net interest margin from falling further. We continue to have success in asset gathering and our FDIC insured bank sweep deposit \u2013 Bank Deposit Sweep Program, maintained its steady growth, reaching an average of $3 billion, up nearly 1 billion from last year. Margin lending and securities lending were the largest contributors to our net interest margin. Average margin loan balances fell 13% from last year. However, due to significantly lower benchmark interest rates, margin loan interest income fell 65%. Margin loans have shown a steady bounce back ending the quarter at $25.7 billion, about 13% over the average for the quarter. Securities lending interest income was up 67% this quarter versus the year ago, as we successfully capitalized on more hard to borrow names that investors were looking to short. On segregated cash, despite a 66% increase in segregated cash balances, lower investment rates led to a 73% decline in interest income. Several factors caused the yields on our segregated cash to differ from the change in Fed funds rate. First, a portion is held in other currencies. And second, given an average duration of investment in treasuries of about 35 days, reinvestments take place over time. So some of our investments, segregated cash would not be expected to follow a Fed rate declines immediately. The increase in segregated cash balances is a function of higher customer credit balances and lower margin lending. While investors were more comfortable taking on leverage this quarter, over time, the growth in our clients cash is consistent and outpaces the variable growth and contraction in margin loan. Note too that the FDIC Sweep Program removes funds that would otherwise be included in our segregated cash balances from our balance sheet for accounting purposes. Now for our estimate of the impact of the next 25 basis point increase in rates, when calculating the impact of rate changes, we understand that as the possibility of a future rate increase becomes more certain, this expectation is typically already reflected in the yields of the instruments in which we invest. Therefore, we attempt to isolate the impact of an unexpected rise of fallen rates separate from the impact of rate hikes or cuts that have already been baked into the prices of these instruments. With that assumption, we would expect the next 25 basis points unanticipated rise in rates to produce an additional $96 million in net interest income over the next four quarters and $110 million as the yearly run rate based on our current balance sheet. These numbers are highly sensitive to benchmark rate changes, due to the impact of low rates on the spread between what we earn on our segregated cash and what we pay to our customers. As U.S. rates fell below 50 basis points, our spread compressed as we earn less when investing our segregated cash. However, the converse is also true that as rates move back up towards 50 basis points, our spread expands significantly. The run rate includes the reinvestment of all of our present holdings at the new assumed rate, but does not take into account any change in how we manage our segregated cash. If we are successful in continuing to grow our customer assets, higher cash and margin lending balances will provide some offset to the loss of net interest income from low benchmark rates, should they persist. Turning to our income statement. As I mentioned earlier, in 2020, we began reporting our consolidated numbers only and no longer report segment. We define non-core items as those not part of our fundamental operating result. Non-core items include four items this quarter. First, our currency diversification strategy produced a gain of $16 million versus $6 million loss last year; second, a mark-to-market loss on U.S. government securities of $13 million versus a gain of $5 million last year; third, a gain on our investments of $13 million versus a loss of $74 million last year; and finally, an unusual customer expense of $104 million on the WTI event versus no equivalent in the year-ago quarter. The net effect of these adjustments reduced pre-tax income by $88 million this year \u2013 this year's quarter and by $75 million last year's quarter. Net revenues were a reported $539 million for the quarter, up 31% versus last year's second quarter. Excluding non-core items, net revenue was up 7% to $523 million. Commission revenue rose 55% on significantly higher volumes in all product categories. Net interest income fell 24% to $196 million, largely due to the drop in average effective Fed funds rate versus the year-ago quarter. Other fees and services revenues rose 14% to $40 million. These include market data, exposure, account activity and FDIC Bank Sweep Program fees, as well as fees generated from facilitating customers' participation in IPO. Other income, which include gains and losses on our investments and currency strategy as well as principal transaction was $27 million versus a $59 million loss last year, Ex-non-core items, other income decreased 31% to $11 million. Non-interest expenses were $317 million for the quarter, up 69% from last year. Adjusting this year for the cost of the unusual WTI event, non-interest expenses were up 13%, due primarily to higher execution and clearing costs, in line with higher trade volumes and to higher employee compensation and benefits costs. At quarter-end, our total headcount stood at 1,815, a 19% increase over last year. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of our employees worldwide have been working remotely. After a brief pause in the first quarter, we have been hiring again to keep up with the influx of new accounts and to strengthen client services, compliance and systems development for the future. Fixed expenses were $238 million, up 97%, primarily due to the unusual WTI event. Without it, fixed expenses were $135 million, up 12%, driven by higher compensation and benefits, in line with the hiring that supports our growing business, as well as some increase in occupancy and G&A expenses. And in April, we donated $5 million to assist efforts to provide food and support for people affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, as well as to advance medical solutions. Ex the WTI loss, customer bad debt expense was $2 million, down 50% from last year and well contained despite the dramatic increase in activity and volatility. Reported pre-tax income was $222 million, down 1% for a 41% margin. Excluding non-core items, pre-tax income was $310 million, up 3% for a 59% pre-tax margin. Diluted earnings per share were $0.40 for the quarter versus $0.43 for the same period in 2019 and ex non-core items diluted earnings per share were $0.57, unchanged from last year as adjusted. To help investors better understand our earnings, taxes and the split between public shareholders and the non-controlling interest, the second quarter numbers are as follows. Starting with our unadjusted pre-tax income of $222 million, we deduct $7 million for income taxes paid by our operating companies, which are mostly foreign taxes. This leaves $215 million, of which 81.4%, or that $175 million reported on our income statement is attributable to non-controlling interest. The remaining 18.6%, or $40 million is available for the public company shareholders. But as this is a non-GAAP measure, it is not reported on our income statement. After we expense remaining taxes of $8 million owed on that $40 million, the public company's net income available for common stockholders is the $32 million you see reported on our income statement. Our income tax expense of $15 million consists of this $8 million, plus the $7 million of taxes paid by the operating company. Turning to the balance sheet with $8.25 billion in consolidated equity, we're well-capitalized from a regulatory standpoint. We deploy our strong capital base toward opportunities to grow our brokerage business worldwide, as well as to emphasize the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners. We continue to carry no long-term debt. And at June 30, margin loans were $25.7 billion, about even with last year, but up 28% from March 31, as clients increased leverage over the quarter. We continue to expect swings in margin lending balances, reflecting both economic conditions and our success in attracting institutional customers who are more opportunistic in taking on leverage. We offer the lowest margin lending rates of our competitors. And as we expand our customer base, we remain well-positioned to satisfy our customers' risk appetite. Now, I'll turn the call back over to the moderator and we will take some questions. Sure. So to your first question, and that's a good observation. So, yes, the number was actually positive on a customer credit balances, because the benchmark rates have fallen so low, primarily in the U.S. that our standard credit rate to customers, which is Fed funds less 50 basis points, ordinarily a very tight spread, is now zero. So all of those customer credits earned zero at the moment at these benchmark rates. And there are some non-U.S. dollar currencies such \u2013 in particular, euros, which are at negative rates and some of their customers get a pass-through rate, which results in a small net income on all of the currency balances. Yes. So we're probably not far off from what Thomas indicated in the first quarter. So the second quarter $201 million net interest income, we have \u2013 if rates don't change at all, we have a little ways to go in terms of the rollover of current investments that will roll over at somewhat lower rates. And our estimate is that could be another $40 million or so reduction, but only if all the other factors stay the same. And, of course, what we've seen is pretty strong growth in credit balances as we've taken on new customers and new deposits, so forth, but also quite a strong bounce back in the margin debit. There is \u2013 people are definitely taking on leverage again. And if that continues, those numbers will be better. Yes. I'm sorry. Did you say share count? So historically, our share count has increased regularly every year, as our employee stock incentive plan vests and those shares become part of the public shares, that's the primary reason. And then also historically, there has been an opportunity for the holders of the \u2013 what's known as a non-controlling interest in the financial statement to effectively redeem that interest for public shares and that has also increased the flow. But as you can see, we went \u2013 we IPOed in 2007 with 10%, and it's at 18% and change now. So that tells you something about the pace at which that takes place generally. Right. So I mean, again, depending on a number of assumptions, primarily at the rates either stay up zero or go to zero, the U.S. rates aren't \u2013 are not effectively at zero. They have been in the 15 basis points, plus or minus for a while. So my number was based on all of that going at 15 basis points. So it's a very broad base for us. We have a lot of customers, obviously, and a lot of holdings. And so there's a base of that income that tends to rise and I say tends to, because the market conditions often determine how short customers want to be, how much risk they want to take on, et cetera, if they buy stocks on margin, they become available to be used in securities lending market. So there is a broad base that is generally increasing for us as our customer base increases. Having said that, as I've said before, that business is sensitive to the opportunities that come up with some well-known names that you, I'm sure, probably following that you \u2013 that become hot stocks from time to time, meaning that the short interest is enough and the availability is not prevalent. And so the cost of securities lending goes up. And if our customers are long and we're able to lend those shares out into the marketplace, they generate a lot more income than the run-of-the-mill stocks. So we've spent lots of our development \u2013 software development efforts over the years to be able to hone our skills in taking advantage when those rates present themselves. And so that's a lot of what you see from quarter-to-quarter in terms of the opportunities. But we have \u2013 we built our systems and, of course, our team to take advantage of those when they arise. I don't think we're seeing any particular competitive pressures. As a matter of fact, there's some evidence that since the COVID situation and work at home and the uncertainty in many industries and the layoffs and so forth, I think, we've actually seen an opening up of supply, if you will, of highly qualified people and we've somewhat taking advantage of that. And then, of course, we continue to build up our operations in India in client services and software development, and we can \u2013 we manage to find quite qualified people there and, of course, that's at a lower cost. Well, there's always a mix of the product mix and that it's highly variable in terms of \u2013 in certain products if the customer orders happened to be providing liquidity, maybe that's a lower fee, maybe even a rebate, and so forth. So higher volume doesn't translate exactly into higher execution and clearing costs. Volumes were up and costs are about the same this time. Well, it's primarily reinvestment at lower rates. But there's some effect coming from, say, margin loans that are still \u2013 would have some room to come down, because they're not at our best year, right? So our best \u2013 currently, our best year is a minimum of 75 basis points. But to the extent that some loans are being charged more than that, those would come down a bit, so it's a combination of several factors."

            "content": "So, historically, we have an account growth rate of slightly over 20%. This quarter, we had \u2013 we saw 60%. We do not expect that to continue. I think, eventually, we're going to go back to somewhere in the low-20s. And \u2013 but that will be on an ever-increasing base. So the number of accounts will \u2013 there'll be more and more accounts added every quarter, more and more additional accounts, right? If you want to know what happened so far this month, only 20 days have passed. I wouldn't want to speculate about the next 10. So watch the monthly releases, please... ...if you are that curious. So, as we said previously, geography has more rounded out in the sense that where we had experienced very high rates previously, it moderated and where we had experienced relatively lower rates of increase, the rate has increased. So our lowest rates geography-wise is China, number one and the U.S. number two. And our highest rates are the outskirts of China and Eastern Europe, South America, Canada, et cetera. So the strongest growth we're experiencing from individual customers, as you can see that our individual customers have \u2013 now constitute varies by sheet. Our individual customers now constitute, I think, 55% of our account. And about two years ago, there were at 50%. So as far as the size of the accounts, they remain relatively the same. So what happens is that, when people open account, they open it with very little money, and then they tend to add and add and add. So while the average account opens up, let's say, probably $60,000, by the time they are with us for two years, they are roughly $200,000. So this is a long-term gain, and we expect that eventually interest will go back up. And so on the long-term, we definitely want to have the bank. But our immediate enthusiasm in view of the lower rates that definitely \u2013 have definitely cooled. So we are still doing it, but we are not doing it with the same rapid desire as we did it before. So it's going forward, but slower. Yes. So our average client age is, I think, it's 46. And the \u2013 maybe they are a couple of years younger. So they are slightly younger. That \u2013 but as far as the tendency to trade, it's roughly the same. Well, there are a number of RIAs who are expressing interest, who \u2013 most of them used to have accounts with Schwab and with Ameritrade. And they are not \u2013 since they don't want to have all their eggs in one basket, they are now beginning to inquire about having some of their accounts with us. And the second complaint, if I could call it that is that, some folks have gone from Schwab to Ameritrade and some went from Ameritrade to Schwab. And they are saying, no, I don't want to be back to where I moved away from. So \u2013 and there is one more item, which is that some believe that Schwab is actively competing against independent RIAs by their own internal RIAs. It's already happening."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Interactive Brokers Group First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Nancy Stuebe, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.\nNancy Stuebe: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. He will handle the Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the Company's belief regarding future events, which, by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the Company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we want to emphasize that our focus is on our employees, clients and communities. Senior management at Interactive Brokers has worked together for decades, most from before the inception of the electronic broker. We were all here during the financial crisis. Many were here in 1987 as well. Our company's culture has been one of working hard independently and together to solve problems and come up with solutions, preferably automated ones. This strength of management cohesion and long-time experience enabled us to react to recent events in a coordinated way worldwide, which allowed us to move quickly to a work-from-home model. Globally, the majority of our employees are working remotely, and they have the tools needed to work effectively. Because our systems and processes are highly automated, the bulk of our employees can work from outside a physical office. Our long-time focus on automated, self-service solutions, like our IBot AI system that can answer many client questions served us well during this time. And while the market turbulence, together with the high volume of new accounts had at times this quarter challenged our client service call capacity, we activated plans to address this and have made good progress in reducing wait times. While the world around us has changed greatly in the past few months, Interactive Brokers\u2019 ability to achieve new records has not. Accounts rose 22% over last year to 760,000, as we added 70,000 net new accounts in the quarter, about the same number of account adds in one quarter as we added over the first three quarters of 2019. This implies a 40% annualized account growth rate. Account growth was seen in all client segments and all geographic regions. There has been no change in the ability of China accounts to fund. Despite markets down about 9% year-on-year, our total client equity rose 9% to $161 billion, the second highest quarterly total in our history. As our customer base grew, DARTs and DARTs per account also rose significantly as more clients traded actively during record-high market volatility. Total DARTs reached over 1.4 million, up 71% from last year, while DARTs per account grew to over 450, their highest level in about four years. And during the month of March, our DARTs exceeded 2 million. We have spoken many times of our focus on growing our customer base in all segments, so we can take advantage of volatility in any market scenarios. Our business is strong even with moderate volatility, but because of the highly automated nature of our platform and our low-cost structure, higher volatility and trading activity sends a greater proportion of revenues to our bottom line. When we are asked, what led to the strength? It is simple. It all leads back to our platform, its global reach and vast product offering and the strength and reliability of its automation during busy periods. Because of this, when people anywhere in the world, plus stay at home, as they are during the recent coronavirus pandemic and they look for something productive to do, Interactive Brokers can help them find it. However, we must fess up to the dim outlook for net interest revenue in the new zero interest regime. While our net interest income has been slightly over $250 million per quarter, we will be lucky to get to $150 million per quarter while rates are near zero and margin loans and short interest remain at lower levels. Finally, our total equity reached over $8 billion in the first quarter, our highest amount to date. With no debt, our balance sheet remains strong. As we continue to grow larger, our equity capital helps us attract larger customers. We saw growth in all five of the client types that we service. I will now go over our five client segments. Individual customers, which made up 52% of our accounts, 36% of our client equity, and 51% of our commissions were particularly strong this quarter with 12-month account growth of 29%, client equity growth of 11%, and 12% growth in commissions. Despite a background of 9% drop \u2013 9%-plus drops in most major markets, the increases we saw in client equity and commissions indicate the strength of our growth in this segment. While all geographic regions we serve saw double-digit account growth, we saw particularly strong increases in Europe and Asia, showing the importance of providing a reliable platform to a global audience that offers wide product choices and worldwide access. This way, clients have the maximum opportunities to invest in the way they prefer. As mentioned earlier, Interactive Brokers is a stay-at-home company with individuals wanting to trade and manage their money now that they have the time to do so, and the growth we saw in the individual segment reflects this. We continue to see growth in the hedge fund customer segment despite world market weakness. For the 12 months ended March 31, we saw 4% hedge fund account growth, 2% customer equity growth and 1% commission growth. We continue to benefit from growing word of mouth, a reputation for best price execution, low margin rates and from the quality of our platform and the strength of our balance sheet. Hedge funds represent 1% of our accounts, 8% of our client equity and 9% of our commissions. Proprietary trading firms are 2% of our accounts, 12% of client [indiscernible]. For the quarter, this group grew by 11% in accounts for the 12-month period, 23% in client equity, and 17% in commissions. Prop trading firms are sensitive to the direction of volatility and trade more as volatility increases. This quarter's high volatility led to more active trading strategies, while accounts and client equity grew due to more traders wanting to be on our platform and to capitalize on its reputation for seamlessness and efficient trade executions. Financial advisors are 14% of our accounts, 20% of our customer equity, and 15% of our commissions. This group grew accounts by 8% for the 12-month period, while customer equity declined by 6% and commissions were flat. World market's declines over the period meant that client equity did not keep pace with account growth and commissions for the segment, which typically tend to trade more conservatively, were flat. Our final segment is introducing brokers. These represent 31% of our accounts, 24% of our client equity, and 10% of our commissions. IBroker segment account growth was 19% for the latest 12 months, with 18% in client equity growth, and 15% in commissions. Interactive Brokers platform and its ability to offer global trading and seamless back-office functionality are compelling arguments for brokers who more and more take a service for a global offering as people worldwide seek to trade on recent market volatility and want to be able to access many markets in order to do so. We continue to enhance our platform and this quarter expanded our mutual fund offering to close to 25,000 mutual funds, including additions to our offshore fund offerings for our global client base. Our new offshore fund scanner allows clients to choose from a wide variety of funds. And of course, we always aim to be significantly less expensive. We do not charge high custody or transaction fees for offshore funds. Rather, our fees range in price from free to just under \u20ac5. We have also seen better response from our digital marketing efforts since year-end, a positive development we hope will continue. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul?\nPaul Brody: Thank you, Nancy. Thanks everyone for joining the call. I hope you all are safe and healthy. First, I'll review our operating results and non-core items and my comments will follow the formality earnings release after which we will open up the call for questions. You will note that starting this quarter, we are no longer presenting separate operating business segments. After several years of winding down our market-making activity, we have reached the point where it is not contributing materially to our overall results. The streamline presentation reflects our management focus on our robust electronic brokerage business. We have also revised presentation of line items in the revenue section of our income statement, grouping the interest income and expense lines and splitting other fees and services from other income. The former contains recurring items such as market data fees and FDIC Bank Sweep Program income, while the latter contains currency impacts, U.S. treasury marks-to-market, principal trading activities and other investment gains or losses. Turning to the operating data. The operating metrics reflected record levels of trading and account openings in a high volatility environment. This was a tumultuous quarter given the impact of the coronavirus around the world. Volatility as measured by the average VIX nearly doubled to 30.7 in the current quarter up from 16.7 in the first quarter last year. In contrast to the first three months in 2019 when the VIX ranged from 15 to 20, this quarter after showing similar levels in the first two months, the index averaged 57 in March and it's floated to a high of over 82 mid-month. This dramatic increase corresponded with higher industry trading volumes and products across the board. Compared to the first quarter of 2019, our quarterly total DARTs rose 71% to a record 1.45 million. Our customer trade volumes rose dramatically in every product class led by increases of 64%, 59% and 24% in customer options, futures and stock volumes respectively. FX dollar volumes were strong as well increasing 58%. Total accounts reached 760,000, up 22% over the prior year, which contributed to customer equity growth of 9% to $160.7 billion at quarter-end despite a drop of 9% in the S&P 500 index over the time period. Our overall average cleared commission per commissionable order fell 10% versus last year to $3.30. On a product mix, it featured smaller average trade sizes in stocks, futures and ForEx and higher in options. Moving onto our net interest margin table. Our net interest margin narrowed from 1.67% to 1.45% in the first quarter as benchmark interest rates declined and clients delevered, resulting in a greater proportion of their assets held in cash and less margin lending. The Federal Reserve made a series of moves in March to aid the economy in light of the impact of the coronavirus, the end result of which was a near zero interest rate policy in the U.S. In light of the flat yield curve, we kept the duration of our portfolio relatively short and recorded a mark-to-market gain of $11 million on our holdings of U.S. treasuries. As always, we plan to hold these securities to maturity, but as brokers, unlike banks, GAAP rules require us to mark them to market in our financial reporting. Outside the U.S., benchmark interest rates were cut in many currencies as central banks look to soften the impact on the COVID-19 pandemic with exceptions in countries where rates were already zero or negative. This moderates somewhat our expectations on the impact of U.S. rates on net interest income as about a quarter of customer credit balances are not in U.S. dollars. Increased customer balances despite lower rates in this quarter versus last year, generated more net interest income on cash balances. In addition to the cash from customers liquidating positions, we continue to have success in asset gathering. Along with the growth in cash balances, our FDIC Insured Bank Deposit Sweep Program has grown to $2.9 billion up from $1.9 billion last year. Margin lending and segregated cash management continued to be the largest contributors to our net interest margin. Average margin loan balances rose 6% versus last year, however, significantly lower interest rates versus last year led to a 20% decline in margin interest income. Lower rates also reduced our earnings on segregated cash where despite a 32% increase in segregated cash balances, interest income fell 0.2%, note that effective Fed funds fell nearly in half over this time period. Several factors caused the yields on our segregated cash to differ from the changes in Fed funds rates. First, the portion is held in other currencies; and second, given an average duration of an investment in treasuries of about 44 days during the quarter, free investments take place over time so these amounts would not be expected to follow-up that declines immediately. The increase in segregated cash balances is also a function of customers\u2019 diminished appetite for risk. That is less investment in stocks, particularly in purchases financed by margin loans leads to more segregated cash on the sideline to be invested. Note 2 that the FDIC suite program removes funds that would otherwise be included in our segregated cash balances from our balance sheet for accounting purposes. Securities lending interest income was up 19% this quarter versus a year-ago as we capitalized on more hard-to-borrow names that investors were looking to short. Now for our estimate of the impact of the next 25 basis point increase in rates, however unlikely that may seem at the time. When calculating the impact of rate changes, we understand that as the possibility of a future rate increase becomes more certain, this expectation is typically already reflected in the yields of the instruments in which we invest. Therefore, we attempt to isolate the impact of an unexpected price of falling rates separate from the impact of rate hikes or cuts that have already been baked into the prices with these instruments. With that assumption, we would expect the next 25 basis point unanticipated rising rates to produce an additional $79 million in net interest income over the next four quarters and $94 million as the yearly run rate based on our current balance sheet. These numbers are higher than our typical calculation due to the impact of low benchmark rates on the spread between what we earn on our segregated cash and what we pay to our customers. As U.S. rates fall below 50 basis points, the spread compresses as we are in less on our segregated cash. However, the converse is also true that as rates move back up towards 50 basis points, the spread rises. The run rate includes the reinvestment of all of our present holdings at the new assumed rate, but does not take into account any change in how we might manage our segregated cash. If we are successful in continuing to grow our customer assets, the higher cash and margin lending balances will provide some offset to the loss of net interest income from low benchmark rates, should they persist. As I explained earlier, this quarter, we begin reporting our consolidated numbers only without segments. We define non-core items as those not part of our fundamental operating results. Non-core items adjusted the numbers versus the year-ago quarter as follows. Our currency diversification strategy lost $19 million a year-ago versus the loss of $49 million this quarter, so a comparative decrease in income of $30 million, a shift from $104 million mark-to-market gain to $11 million loss on investments, reduced income by $115 million, mark-to-market gains on U.S. government securities went from $5 million to $11 million, a comparative increase of $6 million, and unusual customer bad debt expense of $42 million in the year-ago quarter did not recur in the first quarter. The net effect of these adjustments reduced income by $97 million comparatively versus last year. Net revenues were reported $532 million for the quarter down 5% versus last year's first quarter. Excluding non-core items, the net revenue was up 24% to $581 million. Commission revenue rose 55% on significantly higher volumes in all product categories. Lower average trade sizes in nearly all product categories, reduced our average cleared commission per commissionable order to $3.30. This is often seen during high volatility periods as traders risk less in a fast-moving market. Net interest income rose 4% and $256 million despite a 48% decline in the average effective Fed funds rate versus the year-ago quarter. Other fees and services revenues, which includes market data, exposure, account activity and FDIC bank sweep program fees as well as order flow income from options exchange mandated programs rose $3 million or 9% over the last year. Other income, which includes gains and losses on our investments and currency strategy as well as principal transactions was a loss of $31 million and ex-non-core items, other income increased 29% to $18 million. Non-interest expenses were $224 million for the quarter up 2% from last year. Adjusting 2019 for an unusual margin loss, non-interest expenses were up 27% due primarily to higher execution and clearing costs in line with higher trade volumes. At quarter end, our total headcount stood at 1,702, with 17% increase over last year. Currently due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have about three quarters of our employees worldwide working remotely. After a brief pause, we are hiring again to keep up to the influx of new accounts and to strengthen client services and systems development for the future. Fixed expenses were $140 million, up 22% driven by higher compensation and benefits in line with the hiring that supports the growing brokerage business, and G&A expenses, including legal and compliance costs and reserves. Customer bad debt expense was a higher than usual $7 million, but it was well contained despite the dramatic increase in volatility. Reported pretax income was $308 million, down 9% for 58% margin and excluding non-core items, pretax income was $357 million up 23% for a 61% pretax margin. Diluted earnings per share were $0.60 for the quarter versus $0.64 for the same period in 2019 and ex-non-core items diluted earnings per share were $0.69 versus $0.55 as adjusted last year. To help investors better understand our earnings, taxes and the split between the public shareholders and the non-controlling interests, the first quarter numbers are as follows. Starting with our pretax income of $308 million, we deduct $9 million for income taxes paid by our operating companies, which are mostly foreign taxes. This leaves $299 million, of which 81.5% for that $244 million reported on our income statement is attributable to non-controlling interests. The remaining 18.5% or $55 million is available to the public company shareholders, but as this is a non-GAAP measure, it is not reported on our income statement. After we expense remaining taxes of $9 million owed on that $55 million, the public companies net income available for common stockholders is $46 million usually reported on our income statement. Our income tax expense of $18 million consists of this $9 million plus the $9 million of taxes paid by the operating companies. Turning to the balance sheet. It consistently remains highly liquid with low leverage with $8.15 billion in consolidated equity. We are well-capitalized from a regulatory standpoint and continue to deploy our equity capital in the growing brokerage business. We hold excess capital in order to take advantage of opportunities as well as emphasize the strength and depth of our balance sheet, and we continue to carry no long-term debt. At March 31, margin loans were $20 billion, a decline of 22% from last year as clients delevered in a risk-off environment. We continue to expect swings in margin lending balances due to our success in attracting institutional hedge fund customers who are more opportunistic in taking on leverage. We offer the lowest margin lending rates of our competitors, and as we expand our customer base, we stand well-positioned to satisfy customers\u2019 risk appetite when it returns. Now I'll turn it over to the moderator, and we can take some questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nRichard Repetto: Yes. Good evening, Thomas and Paul. I guess my question has to do with the press release that you put out after the close about the provisionary loss you're going to take related to the WTI contract. And I guess the question is, was this due to customers holding the positions right till close to expiration? Because I'm just wondering how they could ever fulfill like the physical delivery requirement of holding the contract.\nThomas Peterffy: So Rich, first of all, I would like to apologize for bringing this announcement on to everybody. So unexpectedly, this happened to us just last night. We were up most of the night trying to figure out what was going on, and we still do not have all of our facts completely in order, but I felt that we have to put out this notice. Now, as to your question, this was a cash-delivered contract, cash-settled contract. So, it was not about delivering. The cash-settled contract is priced off of the delivered contract, the CL. So this is WTI that is priced off of the CL and the CL settlement price, which is a delivered contract, determines the settlement price \u2013 sorry, CL trade price in a two-minute window of between 2:28 and 2:30 Europe Time \u2013 the volume based at average price in those two minutes on the CL contract determines the settlement price for this cash settlement contract. So most of the loss came from WTI, and some of it came from \u2013 Paul, do you remember the name of that future?\nPaul Brody: QM, which is the minimum crude oil contract.\nThomas Peterffy: QM, minimum crude oil contract that's trading on the CME.\nRichard Repetto: Okay. So well, both the contracts are listed contracts on the CME then, is that correct?\nThomas Peterffy: No. The WTI is listed on ICE-Europe.\nRichard Repetto: Got it. Okay.\nThomas Peterffy: So ICE has a European branch, and that's where it is listed.\nRichard Repetto: Understood.\nThomas Peterffy: Part of the provision goes on that contract.\nRichard Repetto: Understood. Okay. I guess the next question is, Paul, on the expected outlook on the net interest income, and I said going from $250 million, I think, you said per quarter \u2013 I thought you said per quarter to $150 million. And I guess if you could just sort of walk through sort of the sensitivities there, so we'd just better understand how you come up with that number?\nPaul Brody: Well, naturally, there's a lot of moving parts in there. So you have to make certain assumptions, some of them are relatively broad, about what rates might do or they're going to do nothing, and then of course, what balances are likely to be. And the balances are not a small part of the equation, because we've seen radical increases in cash credit balances as customers own long positions. They're happy to leave the cash with us. And then, of course, a big part of the projection has to do with the spread compression. And what I alluded to when the Fed goes below 50 basis points is that our base credit rate is Fed funds less 50 basis points, that's a very good rate versus our competitors, but of course, becomes zero when the benchmark goes below 50 basis points. So that creates the spread compression, which is also why there's this big elasticity when you see \u2013 as we talk about rates going back up, if they were to go back up, you get a lot back quickly, because for a certain portion of it, the customers side that we're paying on still doesn't go up until it passes sort of zero, right. So there are a lot of moving parts in there. We have to make certain assumptions at the moment. This is our best projection.\nRichard Repetto: Got it. That's very helpful. And I guess, the last thing, Thomas, you've mentioned about this stay-at-home phenomenon, where it seems like you're benefiting from more client activity. And I guess, the question is, with all this activity, we're still not seeing any \u2013 or could you refresh us in regards to any material difference in mix of the IBKR Lite versus IBKR Pro? We're seeing people still choose IBKR Pro even in this \u2013 even with high trading volatility, and maybe it drives even more so, if they require the smart router even more so.\nThomas Peterffy: Right. So the more volatile the market is, the more important it is that you get the execution prices, because in a very volatile market, the execution prices can differ to the prices that you see, because it changes so up and much, much, much more. So yes, people choose IBKR Pro over the majority of them. So far, we have between 20,000 and 21,000 accounts that have chosen to convert to or open an IBKR Lite account and 760,000 I Pro. I'm sorry, these are today's numbers. So I'm sorry, I should have gotten back to the end of last quarter, yes.\nRichard Repetto: No worries. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you, Thomas and thank you, Paul.\nThomas Peterffy: All right.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen from Compass Point. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Allen: Good evening, everyone. I was wondering if we could just dig into the net interest income outlook a little bit more. You gave us kind of the starting point to think about customer loan \u2013 margin loans for 2Q, and we can make some assumptions around that and the cash levels. How are you guys thinking about the SEC lending book? And then also, does it contemplate continued growth in your customer base from here? Obviously, we can bottom it at certain level, but then even if rates are stable, we should start to see some growth start to drive that higher. So any color on that would be helpful.\nThomas Peterffy: Right. But you see EBITDA growth, for the numbers, what they are today or at least what they were at the end of the quarter, the projected interest income would be even lower. But most of it is due to the fact that we get basically 15 basis points on customer cash. And that is the biggest item there, right, because we have roughly $70 billion of customer cash, of which $20 billion is lent out in margin loans and $50 billion is lent out in the short-term treasury market, and that yields only 15 basis points. So that's the culprit. As far \u2013 otherwise, the fact that the margin loans came down from close to $30 billion to $20 billion, that's another big drawback. And the third is that the short book came down from roughly around $10 billion to $7 billion or $8 billion.\nPaul Brody: Now part of that last point, if I could jump in, is that prices are down, right. But clearly, there's been some winding of the positions. But let me say what we've talked about before, which is that the securities lending business is very driven by stocks that get special for a period of time, where great interest, particularly on the short side, kicks up and they become expensive to borrow and lend. And if our customers are on the long side of that, it generates a lot of revenue. So there is, of course, a base of both the shorts and the longs, but it's very much driven by these stocks that become special for short periods of time.\nChristopher Allen: Understood. And then just switching over to the provision loss, I appreciate the color there. Obviously, there's a lot of chatter just around what's going on in oil ETFs. Are you seeing any other dislocations in markets like there? Any thoughts on the market structure in these products in terms of things that we have to worry about moving forward from a credit loss perspective?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, hopefully, not on our end, but I think there are other people out there with various problems having to do with exchange-traded notes and funds that are holding oil futures. And as I said on the TV interview, there are folks \u2013 we have 15% of the open interest. So there is 85% out there in somebody \u2013 some other folks. And so that\u2019s a proportion of loss to the percentages. And there is also a big winner out there, at least one or many, who was holding the opposite side.\nChristopher Allen: Understood. I'll get back to you. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Nance from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nWill Nance: Hi, good afternoon. Thomas, I was wondering if you can provide some more clarity around the regulatory matters mentioned in the press release. And if you could provide some more clarity around the findings around the BSA/AML practices, maybe if you have some sort of idea around what the shortcomings identified were and what it will take to remedy them? And then, I guess, either Thomas \u2013 go ahead.\nThomas Peterffy: All I can say about that is that we have been on this topic working on this topic for about at least two years. And as you can imagine, the part of the press release was very carefully drafted. And given the thing is still not has not closed, but it's likely to be closed within probably certainly by the next quarterly meeting, you just have to wait. I mean, I'm sorry, but those are telling you to be very, very careful in whatever you say about open cases.\nWill Nance: Sure. And maybe leaving aside and I totally understand that there's probably you're probably limited on what you can say. Maybe leaving the fine aspect aside, can you talk about what you're thinking about with the third-party consultants and what the kind of scope or what that might entail from a cost perspective going forward would be?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, we have been working with these consultants for at least a year, I'm sure. And so there will be the same consultants, and we're working with them very well. And I assume that the cost will be going forward will be similar to what they have been in the past. So I don't think there is any surprises coming from there.\nWill Nance: Got it. That makes sense. And then maybe switching gears over to expenses. I guess, one, just a little housekeeping item. The given the strong volumes, I would have thought execution and clearing might have been a little bit higher. Was there anything to call out that drove that to be a little bit lower than expected this quarter? And then separately, more bigger picture, given the decline in net interest income that you expect, given the rate environment, are there any levers to pull on the cost side that might offset some of this and maybe help you retain some of your kind of best-in-class margins?\nThomas Peterffy: So well, as far as the second question goes, we have always been, throughout our history, been focusing on growth. And well, sometimes revenues are low, sometimes they are high. We do not look at that. When we deal with expenses, we always spend as much money as we productively can to grow the business. That's always been our focus, and we have never looked at expenses. Now, of course, you hopefully \u2013 so I don't remember the first question, but I remember that the answer is that trades were generally smaller in this quarter. Oh, you asked how the trading \u2013 the expenses on the trader were not higher. It's because trades are generally lower in size than previous quarter, even though as you see the volume was much, much, much greater. You can just extrapolate by volume because you have to include the size of the trade. And if you look at the monthly releases, you can see that, right.\nWill Nance: Right. So if I look at more on shares traded and...\nThomas Peterffy: Right.\nWill Nance: Got it. Okay. And then if I could squeeze one more, a quick one in just for Paul. If I think some people are probably a bit surprised by the magnitude of the decline in net interest margin. I think everyone understood that lower rates pressure the spread, but the absolute size is probably a little bit larger. Is it a fair statement to say that a big driver of that is just the decline in margins? And could you maybe talk about how sensitive that $150 million run rate could be if we see kind of a rebound in margin balances over the next several quarters?\nThomas Peterffy: So if I may I'm the fellow who is responsible for investing the customer cash. And the fact is that we do not do anything sensitive. We are investing in short-term treasuries. So we fluctuate with the short-term treasury rates. And as you know, when treasury rates go above 0.5%, that extra, we return to our customers. So we're only sensitive here where the interest rate is between 0% and 0.5%. Once we're above 0.5%, we return that excess to the customers, at least to those whose accounts are larger than $100,000, which I think is over \u2013 only $10 million of our customer funds are in accounts that are less than $100,000. As far as the margin balances, as I said before, they have gone down from $30 billion to $20 billion. And obviously, we do not want to increase the margin rates because we hope to work that up back up to $30 billion, $40 billion, $50 billion. So we're never trying to maximize income for the next several quarters. We are always trying to maximize income for the years to come.\nWill Nance: Got it. Appreciate you taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is now open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good evening. Sorry to belabor the point on NII, but I just want to ask a couple of more questions. One, you just mentioned you're responsible for investing that client cash. I remember that back in 2016, I think over 90% of the securities portfolio at that time was invested in U.S. government securities, and repo is really a small part of what you're doing. Now it's kind of inverted, mostly just overnight, repo. Could you take any more duration risk go out two-year, three-year, four-year or two or five-year on the treasury curve? And then the second part of that question is, you were looking previously at potentially expanding the securities that you will be comfortable investing in for that securities portfolio, I think some other agency securities? Is that on the table as well to maybe pick up some additional yield in that book?\nThomas Peterffy: So I think it's basically the same question, whether we do agencies or longer-term treasuries. My answer is that especially on these rates, I mean, it's hard to imagine that they can go any further down. As a matter of fact, the federal government pushing all this money out and more and more and more and more, I think eventually, the inflation will enter the picture and the fact you have to do something to counteract that. So I would not, at this time \u2013 certainly, at this time, would not go further out on the yield curve.\nKyle Voigt: Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up for Paul. I know you mentioned that $150 million run rate. Is that a run rate as of today? Because you also mentioned that you still had securities had some duration to them, those treasury securities, but maybe a year or over duration in that portion of the book that I assume would provide you kind of a more of a gradual landing point to maybe get to $150 million a couple of quarters or a few quarters out. But it sounded like that's really the run rate today. Just maybe if you could clarify that.\nPaul Brody: Yes. So because the duration is fairly short, the roll-off happens basically in if you were to project out four quarters, it all happens in the first quarter, and then your reinvestments happen at whatever you assume the reinvestment rate is. So depending on the scenario, say, up 25 basis points, you start to pick that up a little bit of a lag, which is why when I projected $79 million for the first four quarters, but about $94 million full-year run rate, that's exactly why, because it assumes that full investment. Similarly on the downside, we don't have too far to go down. But you have that greater impact \u2013 as we said before, you have that greater impact, because essentially, you're not paying anything to customers on their credit balances at the moment. Therefore, any pickup in the rates go straight to the bottom line, if you will, until you get to that 50 basis points, and then as Thomas said, it becomes a spread.\nKyle Voigt: No, I get that. I guess, I'm just saying that on the securities book yield, I thought there were some of the securities book that was invested in treasuries that may have had a duration of a year or over that portion of the book that would have repriced over a year instead of repriced immediately. But I guess you're saying everything is essentially repriced already?\nPaul Brody: Well, you're right. Some of it is treasuries-owned, that's primarily for the commodities business to meet regulatory requirements. It's a much smaller piece of the total, and some of those do mature a bit further out. But we take all that into account when we talk about that overall duration.\nKyle Voigt: Okay. Got it. And then just the last one from me is just a follow-up on the losses related to WTI. Just wondering if you could just let us know what if those losses were from hedge fund clients or retail clients or just kind of give us an idea of the client segment?\nThomas Peterffy: There were many clients, so we don't have hedge fund clients or our retail clients. We have institutional clients and individual clients. And my understanding is that most of these are from individuals. But as you know, I mean, these individual clients tend to be all traders and people that usually know what they are doing.\nKyle Voigt: Thank you. Thanks, Thomas.\nThomas Peterffy: All right.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Harris: I'm sorry if I missed it, but can you elaborate a little bit on why do you think account growth picked up so materially in the quarter?\nThomas Peterffy: Stay-at-home company. So I think there are many people who have for years been telling themselves that one of these days, I'm going to open a brokerage account, and I'm going to begin to manage my finances myself. And they just never get around to it. And so finally, they have the time and they have the motivation. So they are doing it. It's an educated guess on my part. That's what I think.\nChristopher Harris: Okay. And we've been talking a lot about net interest and the impact on your business. One thing I was thinking about is one of the value propositions of IBKR is the favorable rate you pay the customers on deposits. But now that everybody is...\nThomas Peterffy: Yes. Unfortunately, that has gone away. I think has gone away.\nChristopher Harris: Yes, right, exactly. So do you think that's going to have much of an impact on the outlook in terms of growth? Or are people still going to be attracted to the other parts of your business, whether it be the smart routing order capability or whether it's the lower rate on margin and so on?\nThomas Peterffy: It remains. It remains. Well, as interest rates were coming down, it became less and less relevant already in the quarters preceding this. But of course, I mean, it is zero, and we will not be able to give them anything until Fed goes over 0.5%. But to tell you frankly, I do not think that \u2013 I do not hear that that is as important as the margin rate is. But I really don't know. I mean, it's a different type of person who \u2013 it's probably a less vocal person who is worried about receiving interest on the cash and the person who is trying to get achieve margin loan.\nChristopher Harris: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Mac Sykes from Gabelli. Your line is now open.\nMacrae Sykes: Good afternoon, Thomas. Can you just talk a little bit about the level of volatility, the trade-off between what's good for commission revenue, but still okay for sustaining your customer base?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, that's hard to \u2013 it's a very difficult path, right. Because the higher the volatility, the more trades we do and the customers tend to do less well. And I don't think it's that much due to the volatility, as the volatility tends to be higher and the market goes down basically. So that's why customers tend to do less well. And so up until the market turned around in the last two or three days, things were looking pretty good. Of course, it's a different story again. I really can't tell you where the balance is, what is the ideal ratio of volatility and trades.\nMacrae Sykes: Okay. And then on margin lending, I know you have the card facility. Have you noticed in the last month, any kind of additional margin loan that would be suggestive of stress versus kind of increase in allocation to the market?\nThomas Peterffy: No. So our margin loans have come down drastically and they maybe picked up just a tiny bit in the last two or three weeks, but not much. So no, we haven't seen any of that, no.\nMacrae Sykes: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I am showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Nancy Stuebe for closing remarks.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you, everyone for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will be posting a clean version of our transcript on our site tomorrow. Thank you, again, and we will talk to you next quarter-end.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thanks for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. He will handle the Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the Company's belief regarding future events, which, by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the Company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we want to emphasize that our focus is on our employees, clients and communities. Senior management at Interactive Brokers has worked together for decades, most from before the inception of the electronic broker. We were all here during the financial crisis. Many were here in 1987 as well. Our company's culture has been one of working hard independently and together to solve problems and come up with solutions, preferably automated ones. This strength of management cohesion and long-time experience enabled us to react to recent events in a coordinated way worldwide, which allowed us to move quickly to a work-from-home model. Globally, the majority of our employees are working remotely, and they have the tools needed to work effectively. Because our systems and processes are highly automated, the bulk of our employees can work from outside a physical office. Our long-time focus on automated, self-service solutions, like our IBot AI system that can answer many client questions served us well during this time. And while the market turbulence, together with the high volume of new accounts had at times this quarter challenged our client service call capacity, we activated plans to address this and have made good progress in reducing wait times. While the world around us has changed greatly in the past few months, Interactive Brokers' ability to achieve new records has not. Accounts rose 22% over last year to 760,000, as we added 70,000 net new accounts in the quarter, about the same number of account adds in one quarter as we added over the first three quarters of 2019. This implies a 40% annualized account growth rate. Account growth was seen in all client segments and all geographic regions. There has been no change in the ability of China accounts to fund. Despite markets down about 9% year-on-year, our total client equity rose 9% to $161 billion, the second highest quarterly total in our history. As our customer base grew, DARTs and DARTs per account also rose significantly as more clients traded actively during record-high market volatility. Total DARTs reached over 1.4 million, up 71% from last year, while DARTs per account grew to over 450, their highest level in about four years. And during the month of March, our DARTs exceeded 2 million. We have spoken many times of our focus on growing our customer base in all segments, so we can take advantage of volatility in any market scenarios. Our business is strong even with moderate volatility, but because of the highly automated nature of our platform and our low-cost structure, higher volatility and trading activity sends a greater proportion of revenues to our bottom line. When we are asked, what led to the strength? It is simple. It all leads back to our platform, its global reach and vast product offering and the strength and reliability of its automation during busy periods. Because of this, when people anywhere in the world, plus stay at home, as they are during the recent coronavirus pandemic and they look for something productive to do, Interactive Brokers can help them find it. However, we must fess up to the dim outlook for net interest revenue in the new zero interest regime. While our net interest income has been slightly over $250 million per quarter, we will be lucky to get to $150 million per quarter while rates are near zero and margin loans and short interest remain at lower levels. Finally, our total equity reached over $8 billion in the first quarter, our highest amount to date. With no debt, our balance sheet remains strong. As we continue to grow larger, our equity capital helps us attract larger customers. We saw growth in all five of the client types that we service. I will now go over our five client segments. Individual customers, which made up 52% of our accounts, 36% of our client equity, and 51% of our commissions were particularly strong this quarter with 12-month account growth of 29%, client equity growth of 11%, and 12% growth in commissions. Despite a background of 9% drop \u2013 9%-plus drops in most major markets, the increases we saw in client equity and commissions indicate the strength of our growth in this segment. While all geographic regions we serve saw double-digit account growth, we saw particularly strong increases in Europe and Asia, showing the importance of providing a reliable platform to a global audience that offers wide product choices and worldwide access. This way, clients have the maximum opportunities to invest in the way they prefer. As mentioned earlier, Interactive Brokers is a stay-at-home company with individuals wanting to trade and manage their money now that they have the time to do so, and the growth we saw in the individual segment reflects this. We continue to see growth in the hedge fund customer segment despite world market weakness. For the 12 months ended March 31, we saw 4% hedge fund account growth, 2% customer equity growth and 1% commission growth. We continue to benefit from growing word of mouth, a reputation for best price execution, low margin rates and from the quality of our platform and the strength of our balance sheet. Hedge funds represent 1% of our accounts, 8% of our client equity and 9% of our commissions. Proprietary trading firms are 2% of our accounts, 12% of client [indiscernible]. For the quarter, this group grew by 11% in accounts for the 12-month period, 23% in client equity, and 17% in commissions. Prop trading firms are sensitive to the direction of volatility and trade more as volatility increases. This quarter's high volatility led to more active trading strategies, while accounts and client equity grew due to more traders wanting to be on our platform and to capitalize on its reputation for seamlessness and efficient trade executions. Financial advisors are 14% of our accounts, 20% of our customer equity, and 15% of our commissions. This group grew accounts by 8% for the 12-month period, while customer equity declined by 6% and commissions were flat. World market's declines over the period meant that client equity did not keep pace with account growth and commissions for the segment, which typically tend to trade more conservatively, were flat. Our final segment is introducing brokers. These represent 31% of our accounts, 24% of our client equity, and 10% of our commissions. IBroker segment account growth was 19% for the latest 12 months, with 18% in client equity growth, and 15% in commissions. Interactive Brokers platform and its ability to offer global trading and seamless back-office functionality are compelling arguments for brokers who more and more take a service for a global offering as people worldwide seek to trade on recent market volatility and want to be able to access many markets in order to do so. We continue to enhance our platform and this quarter expanded our mutual fund offering to close to 25,000 mutual funds, including additions to our offshore fund offerings for our global client base. Our new offshore fund scanner allows clients to choose from a wide variety of funds. And of course, we always aim to be significantly less expensive. We do not charge high custody or transaction fees for offshore funds. Rather, our fees range in price from free to just under \u20ac5. We have also seen better response from our digital marketing efforts since year-end, a positive development we hope will continue. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul? Thank you, everyone for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will be posting a clean version of our transcript on our site tomorrow. Thank you, again, and we will talk to you next quarter-end."

            "name": "Paul Brody",
            "content": "Thank you, Nancy. Thanks everyone for joining the call. I hope you all are safe and healthy. First, I'll review our operating results and non-core items and my comments will follow the formality earnings release after which we will open up the call for questions. You will note that starting this quarter, we are no longer presenting separate operating business segments. After several years of winding down our market-making activity, we have reached the point where it is not contributing materially to our overall results. The streamline presentation reflects our management focus on our robust electronic brokerage business. We have also revised presentation of line items in the revenue section of our income statement, grouping the interest income and expense lines and splitting other fees and services from other income. The former contains recurring items such as market data fees and FDIC Bank Sweep Program income, while the latter contains currency impacts, U.S. treasury marks-to-market, principal trading activities and other investment gains or losses. Turning to the operating data. The operating metrics reflected record levels of trading and account openings in a high volatility environment. This was a tumultuous quarter given the impact of the coronavirus around the world. Volatility as measured by the average VIX nearly doubled to 30.7 in the current quarter up from 16.7 in the first quarter last year. In contrast to the first three months in 2019 when the VIX ranged from 15 to 20, this quarter after showing similar levels in the first two months, the index averaged 57 in March and it's floated to a high of over 82 mid-month. This dramatic increase corresponded with higher industry trading volumes and products across the board. Compared to the first quarter of 2019, our quarterly total DARTs rose 71% to a record 1.45 million. Our customer trade volumes rose dramatically in every product class led by increases of 64%, 59% and 24% in customer options, futures and stock volumes respectively. FX dollar volumes were strong as well increasing 58%. Total accounts reached 760,000, up 22% over the prior year, which contributed to customer equity growth of 9% to $160.7 billion at quarter-end despite a drop of 9% in the S&P 500 index over the time period. Our overall average cleared commission per commissionable order fell 10% versus last year to $3.30. On a product mix, it featured smaller average trade sizes in stocks, futures and ForEx and higher in options. Moving onto our net interest margin table. Our net interest margin narrowed from 1.67% to 1.45% in the first quarter as benchmark interest rates declined and clients delevered, resulting in a greater proportion of their assets held in cash and less margin lending. The Federal Reserve made a series of moves in March to aid the economy in light of the impact of the coronavirus, the end result of which was a near zero interest rate policy in the U.S. In light of the flat yield curve, we kept the duration of our portfolio relatively short and recorded a mark-to-market gain of $11 million on our holdings of U.S. treasuries. As always, we plan to hold these securities to maturity, but as brokers, unlike banks, GAAP rules require us to mark them to market in our financial reporting. Outside the U.S., benchmark interest rates were cut in many currencies as central banks look to soften the impact on the COVID-19 pandemic with exceptions in countries where rates were already zero or negative. This moderates somewhat our expectations on the impact of U.S. rates on net interest income as about a quarter of customer credit balances are not in U.S. dollars. Increased customer balances despite lower rates in this quarter versus last year, generated more net interest income on cash balances. In addition to the cash from customers liquidating positions, we continue to have success in asset gathering. Along with the growth in cash balances, our FDIC Insured Bank Deposit Sweep Program has grown to $2.9 billion up from $1.9 billion last year. Margin lending and segregated cash management continued to be the largest contributors to our net interest margin. Average margin loan balances rose 6% versus last year, however, significantly lower interest rates versus last year led to a 20% decline in margin interest income. Lower rates also reduced our earnings on segregated cash where despite a 32% increase in segregated cash balances, interest income fell 0.2%, note that effective Fed funds fell nearly in half over this time period. Several factors caused the yields on our segregated cash to differ from the changes in Fed funds rates. First, the portion is held in other currencies; and second, given an average duration of an investment in treasuries of about 44 days during the quarter, free investments take place over time so these amounts would not be expected to follow-up that declines immediately. The increase in segregated cash balances is also a function of customers' diminished appetite for risk. That is less investment in stocks, particularly in purchases financed by margin loans leads to more segregated cash on the sideline to be invested. Note 2 that the FDIC suite program removes funds that would otherwise be included in our segregated cash balances from our balance sheet for accounting purposes. Securities lending interest income was up 19% this quarter versus a year-ago as we capitalized on more hard-to-borrow names that investors were looking to short. Now for our estimate of the impact of the next 25 basis point increase in rates, however unlikely that may seem at the time. When calculating the impact of rate changes, we understand that as the possibility of a future rate increase becomes more certain, this expectation is typically already reflected in the yields of the instruments in which we invest. Therefore, we attempt to isolate the impact of an unexpected price of falling rates separate from the impact of rate hikes or cuts that have already been baked into the prices with these instruments. With that assumption, we would expect the next 25 basis point unanticipated rising rates to produce an additional $79 million in net interest income over the next four quarters and $94 million as the yearly run rate based on our current balance sheet. These numbers are higher than our typical calculation due to the impact of low benchmark rates on the spread between what we earn on our segregated cash and what we pay to our customers. As U.S. rates fall below 50 basis points, the spread compresses as we are in less on our segregated cash. However, the converse is also true that as rates move back up towards 50 basis points, the spread rises. The run rate includes the reinvestment of all of our present holdings at the new assumed rate, but does not take into account any change in how we might manage our segregated cash. If we are successful in continuing to grow our customer assets, the higher cash and margin lending balances will provide some offset to the loss of net interest income from low benchmark rates, should they persist. As I explained earlier, this quarter, we begin reporting our consolidated numbers only without segments. We define non-core items as those not part of our fundamental operating results. Non-core items adjusted the numbers versus the year-ago quarter as follows. Our currency diversification strategy lost $19 million a year-ago versus the loss of $49 million this quarter, so a comparative decrease in income of $30 million, a shift from $104 million mark-to-market gain to $11 million loss on investments, reduced income by $115 million, mark-to-market gains on U.S. government securities went from $5 million to $11 million, a comparative increase of $6 million, and unusual customer bad debt expense of $42 million in the year-ago quarter did not recur in the first quarter. The net effect of these adjustments reduced income by $97 million comparatively versus last year. Net revenues were reported $532 million for the quarter down 5% versus last year's first quarter. Excluding non-core items, the net revenue was up 24% to $581 million. Commission revenue rose 55% on significantly higher volumes in all product categories. Lower average trade sizes in nearly all product categories, reduced our average cleared commission per commissionable order to $3.30. This is often seen during high volatility periods as traders risk less in a fast-moving market. Net interest income rose 4% and $256 million despite a 48% decline in the average effective Fed funds rate versus the year-ago quarter. Other fees and services revenues, which includes market data, exposure, account activity and FDIC bank sweep program fees as well as order flow income from options exchange mandated programs rose $3 million or 9% over the last year. Other income, which includes gains and losses on our investments and currency strategy as well as principal transactions was a loss of $31 million and ex-non-core items, other income increased 29% to $18 million. Non-interest expenses were $224 million for the quarter up 2% from last year. Adjusting 2019 for an unusual margin loss, non-interest expenses were up 27% due primarily to higher execution and clearing costs in line with higher trade volumes. At quarter end, our total headcount stood at 1,702, with 17% increase over last year. Currently due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have about three quarters of our employees worldwide working remotely. After a brief pause, we are hiring again to keep up to the influx of new accounts and to strengthen client services and systems development for the future. Fixed expenses were $140 million, up 22% driven by higher compensation and benefits in line with the hiring that supports the growing brokerage business, and G&A expenses, including legal and compliance costs and reserves. Customer bad debt expense was a higher than usual $7 million, but it was well contained despite the dramatic increase in volatility. Reported pretax income was $308 million, down 9% for 58% margin and excluding non-core items, pretax income was $357 million up 23% for a 61% pretax margin. Diluted earnings per share were $0.60 for the quarter versus $0.64 for the same period in 2019 and ex-non-core items diluted earnings per share were $0.69 versus $0.55 as adjusted last year. To help investors better understand our earnings, taxes and the split between the public shareholders and the non-controlling interests, the first quarter numbers are as follows. Starting with our pretax income of $308 million, we deduct $9 million for income taxes paid by our operating companies, which are mostly foreign taxes. This leaves $299 million, of which 81.5% for that $244 million reported on our income statement is attributable to non-controlling interests. The remaining 18.5% or $55 million is available to the public company shareholders, but as this is a non-GAAP measure, it is not reported on our income statement. After we expense remaining taxes of $9 million owed on that $55 million, the public companies net income available for common stockholders is $46 million usually reported on our income statement. Our income tax expense of $18 million consists of this $9 million plus the $9 million of taxes paid by the operating companies. Turning to the balance sheet. It consistently remains highly liquid with low leverage with $8.15 billion in consolidated equity. We are well-capitalized from a regulatory standpoint and continue to deploy our equity capital in the growing brokerage business. We hold excess capital in order to take advantage of opportunities as well as emphasize the strength and depth of our balance sheet, and we continue to carry no long-term debt. At March 31, margin loans were $20 billion, a decline of 22% from last year as clients delevered in a risk-off environment. We continue to expect swings in margin lending balances due to our success in attracting institutional hedge fund customers who are more opportunistic in taking on leverage. We offer the lowest margin lending rates of our competitors, and as we expand our customer base, we stand well-positioned to satisfy customers' risk appetite when it returns. Now I'll turn it over to the moderator, and we can take some questions. QM, which is the minimum crude oil contract. Well, naturally, there's a lot of moving parts in there. So you have to make certain assumptions, some of them are relatively broad, about what rates might do or they're going to do nothing, and then of course, what balances are likely to be. And the balances are not a small part of the equation, because we've seen radical increases in cash credit balances as customers own long positions. They're happy to leave the cash with us. And then, of course, a big part of the projection has to do with the spread compression. And what I alluded to when the Fed goes below 50 basis points is that our base credit rate is Fed funds less 50 basis points, that's a very good rate versus our competitors, but of course, becomes zero when the benchmark goes below 50 basis points. So that creates the spread compression, which is also why there's this big elasticity when you see \u2013 as we talk about rates going back up, if they were to go back up, you get a lot back quickly, because for a certain portion of it, the customers side that we're paying on still doesn't go up until it passes sort of zero, right. So there are a lot of moving parts in there. We have to make certain assumptions at the moment. This is our best projection. Now part of that last point, if I could jump in, is that prices are down, right. But clearly, there's been some winding of the positions. But let me say what we've talked about before, which is that the securities lending business is very driven by stocks that get special for a period of time, where great interest, particularly on the short side, kicks up and they become expensive to borrow and lend. And if our customers are on the long side of that, it generates a lot of revenue. So there is, of course, a base of both the shorts and the longs, but it's very much driven by these stocks that become special for short periods of time. Yes. So because the duration is fairly short, the roll-off happens basically in if you were to project out four quarters, it all happens in the first quarter, and then your reinvestments happen at whatever you assume the reinvestment rate is. So depending on the scenario, say, up 25 basis points, you start to pick that up a little bit of a lag, which is why when I projected $79 million for the first four quarters, but about $94 million full-year run rate, that's exactly why, because it assumes that full investment. Similarly on the downside, we don't have too far to go down. But you have that greater impact \u2013 as we said before, you have that greater impact, because essentially, you're not paying anything to customers on their credit balances at the moment. Therefore, any pickup in the rates go straight to the bottom line, if you will, until you get to that 50 basis points, and then as Thomas said, it becomes a spread. Well, you're right. Some of it is treasuries-owned, that's primarily for the commodities business to meet regulatory requirements. It's a much smaller piece of the total, and some of those do mature a bit further out. But we take all that into account when we talk about that overall duration."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Thomas Peterffy",
            "content": "So Rich, first of all, I would like to apologize for bringing this announcement on to everybody. So unexpectedly, this happened to us just last night. We were up most of the night trying to figure out what was going on, and we still do not have all of our facts completely in order, but I felt that we have to put out this notice. Now, as to your question, this was a cash-delivered contract, cash-settled contract. So, it was not about delivering. The cash-settled contract is priced off of the delivered contract, the CL. So this is WTI that is priced off of the CL and the CL settlement price, which is a delivered contract, determines the settlement price \u2013 sorry, CL trade price in a two-minute window of between 2:28 and 2:30 Europe Time \u2013 the volume based at average price in those two minutes on the CL contract determines the settlement price for this cash settlement contract. So most of the loss came from WTI, and some of it came from \u2013 Paul, do you remember the name of that future? QM, minimum crude oil contract that's trading on the CME. No. The WTI is listed on ICE-Europe. So ICE has a European branch, and that's where it is listed. Part of the provision goes on that contract. Right. So the more volatile the market is, the more important it is that you get the execution prices, because in a very volatile market, the execution prices can differ to the prices that you see, because it changes so up and much, much, much more. So yes, people choose IBKR Pro over the majority of them. So far, we have between 20,000 and 21,000 accounts that have chosen to convert to or open an IBKR Lite account and 760,000 I Pro. I'm sorry, these are today's numbers. So I'm sorry, I should have gotten back to the end of last quarter, yes. All right. Right. But you see EBITDA growth, for the numbers, what they are today or at least what they were at the end of the quarter, the projected interest income would be even lower. But most of it is due to the fact that we get basically 15 basis points on customer cash. And that is the biggest item there, right, because we have roughly $70 billion of customer cash, of which $20 billion is lent out in margin loans and $50 billion is lent out in the short-term treasury market, and that yields only 15 basis points. So that's the culprit. As far \u2013 otherwise, the fact that the margin loans came down from close to $30 billion to $20 billion, that's another big drawback. And the third is that the short book came down from roughly around $10 billion to $7 billion or $8 billion. Well, hopefully, not on our end, but I think there are other people out there with various problems having to do with exchange-traded notes and funds that are holding oil futures. And as I said on the TV interview, there are folks \u2013 we have 15% of the open interest. So there is 85% out there in somebody \u2013 some other folks. And so that's a proportion of loss to the percentages. And there is also a big winner out there, at least one or many, who was holding the opposite side. All I can say about that is that we have been on this topic working on this topic for about at least two years. And as you can imagine, the part of the press release was very carefully drafted. And given the thing is still not has not closed, but it's likely to be closed within probably certainly by the next quarterly meeting, you just have to wait. I mean, I'm sorry, but those are telling you to be very, very careful in whatever you say about open cases. Well, we have been working with these consultants for at least a year, I'm sure. And so there will be the same consultants, and we're working with them very well. And I assume that the cost will be going forward will be similar to what they have been in the past. So I don't think there is any surprises coming from there. So well, as far as the second question goes, we have always been, throughout our history, been focusing on growth. And well, sometimes revenues are low, sometimes they are high. We do not look at that. When we deal with expenses, we always spend as much money as we productively can to grow the business. That's always been our focus, and we have never looked at expenses. Now, of course, you hopefully \u2013 so I don't remember the first question, but I remember that the answer is that trades were generally smaller in this quarter. Oh, you asked how the trading \u2013 the expenses on the trader were not higher. It's because trades are generally lower in size than previous quarter, even though as you see the volume was much, much, much greater. You can just extrapolate by volume because you have to include the size of the trade. And if you look at the monthly releases, you can see that, right. Right. So if I may I'm the fellow who is responsible for investing the customer cash. And the fact is that we do not do anything sensitive. We are investing in short-term treasuries. So we fluctuate with the short-term treasury rates. And as you know, when treasury rates go above 0.5%, that extra, we return to our customers. So we're only sensitive here where the interest rate is between 0% and 0.5%. Once we're above 0.5%, we return that excess to the customers, at least to those whose accounts are larger than $100,000, which I think is over \u2013 only $10 million of our customer funds are in accounts that are less than $100,000. As far as the margin balances, as I said before, they have gone down from $30 billion to $20 billion. And obviously, we do not want to increase the margin rates because we hope to work that up back up to $30 billion, $40 billion, $50 billion. So we're never trying to maximize income for the next several quarters. We are always trying to maximize income for the years to come. So I think it's basically the same question, whether we do agencies or longer-term treasuries. My answer is that especially on these rates, I mean, it's hard to imagine that they can go any further down. As a matter of fact, the federal government pushing all this money out and more and more and more and more, I think eventually, the inflation will enter the picture and the fact you have to do something to counteract that. So I would not, at this time \u2013 certainly, at this time, would not go further out on the yield curve. There were many clients, so we don't have hedge fund clients or our retail clients. We have institutional clients and individual clients. And my understanding is that most of these are from individuals. But as you know, I mean, these individual clients tend to be all traders and people that usually know what they are doing. All right. Stay-at-home company. So I think there are many people who have for years been telling themselves that one of these days, I'm going to open a brokerage account, and I'm going to begin to manage my finances myself. And they just never get around to it. And so finally, they have the time and they have the motivation. So they are doing it. It's an educated guess on my part. That's what I think. Yes. Unfortunately, that has gone away. I think has gone away. It remains. It remains. Well, as interest rates were coming down, it became less and less relevant already in the quarters preceding this. But of course, I mean, it is zero, and we will not be able to give them anything until Fed goes over 0.5%. But to tell you frankly, I do not think that \u2013 I do not hear that that is as important as the margin rate is. But I really don't know. I mean, it's a different type of person who \u2013 it's probably a less vocal person who is worried about receiving interest on the cash and the person who is trying to get achieve margin loan. Well, that's hard to \u2013 it's a very difficult path, right. Because the higher the volatility, the more trades we do and the customers tend to do less well. And I don't think it's that much due to the volatility, as the volatility tends to be higher and the market goes down basically. So that's why customers tend to do less well. And so up until the market turned around in the last two or three days, things were looking pretty good. Of course, it's a different story again. I really can't tell you where the balance is, what is the ideal ratio of volatility and trades. No. So our margin loans have come down drastically and they maybe picked up just a tiny bit in the last two or three weeks, but not much. So no, we haven't seen any of that, no."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to your host, Director of Investor Relations, Nancy Stuebe. Please go ahead.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. He will handle the Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the Company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the Company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial statements filed with the SEC. 2021 was a good year for Interactive Brokers. Adjusted revenues were $2.78 billion, up 26% for the year, and expenses were well controlled, resulting in a pretax profit margin that improved from 61% to 67%, by far the highest in the industry. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year were $3.37, and that was 35% higher than the previous year. We look back at 2021 as one with unprecedented global investor engagement with the market. The only better year we can see is 2022. Let me explain why. In 2021, we added more customers, over 600,000; and did more trades, over 2.5 million DARTs per day, than we ever have before. We introduced more products and more tools while also expanding many existing ones and to assist with our continuing growth we hired and trained nearly 450 new employees around the world. Our year-on-year account growth was 56% this year. I've been saying for some time that after this unusually active period we have been experiencing a period that seems to keep growing longer, we will see account growth closer to between 30% and 40% a year. But that does not mean that we will not do almost anything we can think of to try to keep it above those levels. We introduced more new products and expanded the capabilities of existing ones. Recognizing our global customer reach, we introduced global analyst, which allows our clients to discover undervalued companies from a wide database of global stocks. We introduced our crypto offering. U.S. individuals, RIAs, hedge funds and introducing brokers as well as individuals in over 100 different countries can now all trade crypto through our partner, Paxos. Very shortly, we will be offering crypto for our international financial advisers, iBrokers and hedge funds in those countries, and we will add more countries continually. We charged just 0.12% to 0.18% of trade value with a minimum $1.75 per trade. We rolled out our ESG-focused impact app, which brings transparency and a streamlined, simplified platform to help clients find and invest in companies that share their values. Impact also allows them to make cash donations to thousands of different U.S. charities directly from the app. We also introduced U.S. spot gold trading and these are just a few of the items we have been working on, and we have other exciting products and improvements in various stages in advance of being rolled out. As 2021 drew to a close, IBKR was able to produce its second best quarter of the year after the hyperactive mean stock events of the first quarter. But the story of the mean stocks will fade in the minds of investors, while the most remarkable story of the year, the huge rise in popularity of options and more specifically, option spreads will remain. As someone who has spent the last 50 years trying to automate the options industry, I very much welcome this development. For a long time, Interactive Brokers was alone trying to stir up industry interest to computerize these markets. But now finally, people are beginning to understand what fantastic versatile instruments options are. I am predicting further growth, especially internationally. Option spreads give traders the opportunity to assume very specific and limited risk reward profile for specific periods of time. Please visit our probability lab on the IBKR website for a fun way to think about, learn about and play with options. As the year were on, listed options saw an average daily volume of nearly 40 million contracts and Interactive Brokers customers responsible for roughly 10% of daily options volume. This is even more than in equities, where we are only about 7%. Execution quality is most important for options traders, especially for options spread traders, where profits and losses tend to be limited and every penny matters. Even the minimum price difference of $0.01 amounts to $1 a contract and bid offer spreads in the market regularly get as wide as $0.05 to $0.10. Interactive Brokers does not accept payment for order flow for IBKR Pro customer orders. We auction off each option order among 16 top market makers. We are always happy to welcome more to this group. These auctions last something on the order of 100 milliseconds, and the winner chooses which exchange it wants to use to trade with the order. IBKR then posts the order for an exchange auction. And if nobody improves on the agreed-upon price, the original winner of the auction trades the contract at that price. This may sound like a rather involved process, but practice it all happens in a fraction of a second. All participants use automated processes and they automatically feed the amount of price improvement they are interested in competing on for any specific option contracts they trade with at that specific point in time. In this way, our customers can take advantage of a leading-edge system designed to get them the best available price. Having been the largest market makers and options for over 30 years, IBKR is very well versed in these processes, many of which we have retained from our Market Maker Day, and we have been keeping them up to date over the years. As new exchanges and new rules are continuously introduced, this is not an easy task, and we have a team of programmers regularly engaged in this activity. Imagine if payments for order flow were prohibited, and all brokers are forced to execute their own customer orders. Sophisticated mechanisms like the ones we developed and use would be expensive and take a long time for others to create. While the idea is interesting to think about, I do not think that it is about to happen anytime soon. Another notable development for IBKR in 2021 was a 40% increase in margin loans over the course of the year. I think this growth will also continue into the future. With 7% inflation as the background, stock prices will have to rise by 7% just to retain the relative value. I believe inflation will continue at a high rate. There is very little the Fed can do about it. They may raise interest rates to 1% or 2%. We would not borrow at that rate and invest in leveraged assets. Even if the Fed funds rate rises to 3%, Interactive Brokers will end at 3.75% to people who want to buy stock, whether or not they combine it with option strategies. The 3% is not likely. A slightly over 3% interest rate would add $1 trillion to annual U.S. debt service and to deficit spending, which would just further increase inflationary pressures. Inflation is here to stay. We'll have to learn to live with it and margin lending will continue to grow along with it. We aim to grow our businesses by growing our customer base. We will continue to introduce new platforms, products and research and trading tools to attract new customers of the type that fit our target, serious, hard-working and educated investors who come to us to succeed with the help of our execution quality and products and services. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody. Paul?\nPaul Brody: Thank you, Nancy, and welcome, everyone, to our IBKR fourth quarter results and then [indiscernible]. Starting with our revenue items on Page 3 of the release. We're pleased the record results during the June quarter, we believe the robust growth of customer positions us well what our transactional [indiscernible]. Conditions continue to be strong, returning our second highest ever quarterly revenues [indiscernible] investment [indiscernible]. We've got substantially higher trading volumes, stock and options, [indiscernible] coming from our large [indiscernible]. Net interest income was strong, generating $295 million of revenue. Also our second highest quarterly performance and this will record full year and leading to a record full year NII of 32% of [indiscernible]. Margin lending remained strong. Investor confidence in market remains [indiscernible]. Securities list also [indiscernible] strong. [indiscernible] showing investment demand rolling broad range here in borrower [indiscernible], lead by a growing [indiscernible]. We generated $58 million of revenue and other fees and services $215 million for the year, 25% despite the midyear [indiscernible]. Strong client activity drove revenues higher. Market data [indiscernible] reached $20 million, up 15% [indiscernible] exposure growth over [indiscernible] as higher volumes, [indiscernible] 0.3% higher [indiscernible]. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our current diversification strategy, and [indiscernible] transaction. Many of these noncore items are excluded in our adjusted earnings. Without those items, other income would be $10 million in the quarter, $54 million. Turning to expenses. Execution, clearing and distribution costs were down even with these [indiscernible] $53 million costs from deposit where down 20% from a year ago quarter and down 19% for the full year. As a percent of traditional revenue, execution and clearing costs are driven by trading costs, declined to 22% in 2020, 13% in 2021. Our customers continue to benefit from the execution fee reductions achieved by our [indiscernible]. This quarter, the costs were reduced by lower regulatory fees [indiscernible]. I've transferred to a headset. I'm hoping that maybe my audio comes over a little bit better. So this quarter, the costs were also reduced by lower regulatory fees as the SEC lowered the rate on U.S. stocks and by a temporary fee holiday on U.S. options by the OCC. Because these benefits are largely passed through to our customers, both costs and commission revenue decreased accordingly. As a result of our order routing improvements, which include utilizing our low-cost IBKR ATS for stock execution, a greater portion of our commission revenue goes to the bottom line. Our ratio of compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenues was 18% for the quarter and 15% for the year, relatively unchanged from last year despite a 26% increase in the headcount. We continue to focus on expense discipline, while improving our strong top line. Our head count at year-end was 2,571. G&A expenses were up 27% from the year ago quarter, though down 25% for the full year, reflecting lower legal expenses on litigation, partially offset by higher spending on advertising and required fees. Our adjusted pretax margin remained a robust 66% by practicing expense control while also hiring and investing in the business for accelerated growth, we continue to maintain the operating leverage in our business. Finally, on the income tax line of the $35 million shown, the operating company's portion was $19 million and the public company's portion was $16 million. Moving to our balance sheet on Page 5 of the release, our total assets ended the year at $109 billion, with growth driven by margin lending to customers. Our consolidated equity capital was $10.2 billion, having reached the $10 billion mark for the first time last quarter. We have no long-term debt. We continue to deploy our balance sheet to support our growing client business in particular. More and larger customers want access to margin lending, which our capital base gives us the ability to provide. We opened two offices in Europe in response to Brexit. For those in our other rapidly growing international locations, our capital base provides the foundation needed today's operations and for future growth. Our capital is also used for numerous other growth and investment opportunities we see worldwide. And finally, an ample capital base helps us win business by showing the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners. Let's now look briefly at our operating data on Pages 6 and 7 of the release. Page 6 shows contract and share volumes for all customers rose 46% in options, well above industry growth, and 19% in futures. While our stock share volume fell 3%, the product mix produced a 1% increase in commissions. Activity is strong across client types and geographies. In most securities products, our volumes are well above the high average activity level of 2020. Turning to Page 7. Account growth remains robust with over 600,000 net new account adds for the year. Total accounts reached 1.68 million, up 56% over the prior year and 9% over the prior quarter. Customer equity growth reflected strength in new accounts, solid additions to existing accounts and a generally supportive market environment. Total customer DARTs reached their second highest quarterly level at over 2.4 million trades per day. This reflected investor confidence in rising markets, the ongoing global search for yield in zero and negative interest rate environment and more customers on our trading platform. Commission per cleared commissionable order continues to show our success in capturing rebates paid by exchanges for our clients. When we route IBKR Pro orders directly to exchanges, we realize these exchange rebates and pass the savings on to our clients by lowering their commissions. Our cleared IBKR Pro customers paid $2.38, 3% less per order than they did last year, as our order routing system found opportunities to maximize rebates while achieving best price execution. Our clients benefit with lower commission costs as we pass our lower execution and clearing costs on to them. Profitability per order to us remains the same. Turning to net interest margin. We break down our net interest margin on Page 8. Total GAAP net interest income was $295 million for the quarter and $1.15 billion for the year, both up over 30% from a year ago, reflecting, in particular, increases in margin lending and securities lending. Average margin loan balances were up 58% for both the quarter and the full year, leading to increases in margin loan interest income of 60% and 41% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Investors remain comfortable taking on leverage in the current rising market environment. Securities lending net interest was up 17% and driven by strong client participation in the markets. As our customer base grows, our opportunities to lend customers shares to other customers who shorten those stocks also grow. Together with increasing our profitable securities lending to other broker-dealers, the model generates expanding revenues. We believe our proprietary system developed in-house for securities lending and operated by our team of specialists. This is proficient in identifying and lending out securities and high demand, which drives our revenue from this activity. Moving to net interest from segregated cash and from customer credit balances. This continues to reflect the impact of negative benchmark rates in certain countries. When benchmark rates are very low as they are in the U.S., we pay no interest to customers on their cash. But in currencies where rates are negative, we earn interest by passing through these negative rates to customers. We earned $8 million on these balances. When benchmark rates are positive, we earn interest on depositing, investing our segregated cash balances. But because of negative rates in some currencies, we had a net cost of $5 million on these balances. Taken together, the net interest income from these balances was $3 million for the quarter. Now our estimate of the impact and increase in U.S. interest rates, we expect the next 25 basis point rise in rates to produce an additional $165 million annually. The increase from past estimates is driven by higher margin loan balances and also follows our introduction of new interest rate tiers and spreads on January 3 of this year. This does not take into account any change in how we may adjust our investment strategy to take advantage of newly higher rates or a change in our assets. About 24% of our customer cash balances are not in U.S. dollars. So estimates of the impact of U.S. rate changes exclude those currencies. As forecasted, Federal Reserve rate consensus for 2022 centers around more than one hike. We can add that a second hike would produce a similar, although somewhat lower annual benefit to the first. In conclusion, we had a strong quarter to close out a record year, reflecting our ability to grow our customer base and product set, and that shows the attractiveness of our strategy to automate for growth, expanding what we offer while minimizing what we charge. Given our progress and performance, we are confident in our ability to grow accounts, as Thomas has indicated, maintain our expense discipline and to capture future opportunities as they arise. With that, I'll turn it back over to the moderator, and we will field some questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. \nRichard Repetto: Sorry. Good evening, Thomas. Good evening, Paul. Can you hear me now?\nPaul Brody: Yes, we can. Yes.\nRichard Repetto: Okay. So the stock shares traded quarter-to-quarter were down, I know, only 3% year-over-year, but I think it was 32% quarter-to-quarter. I suspect that was a lot of low-priced stock trading in 3Q. But could you sort of verify that, Thomas? And also...\nThomas Peterffy: Okay. You're absolutely right. So, many years ago, we put in a commission limit so that we would never charge more than 50 basis points on a stock trade. And that slowly brought more and more low-priced stock traders to us. Eventually, it appears that there are some regulatory concerns about the stock trading, and we have successfully reduced it. It's got no income impact whatsoever. It's -- those are very tiny numbers.\nRichard Repetto: Got it. Understood. Okay. And then, Paul, you sort of touched on this question, but not just three rate hikes in 2022 priced in and three more in 2023, I guess the question is, you said it -- the second rate hike would be similar, but I thought you said somewhat but lower. Any way you could sort of give us a feel for incremental hikes that there's up to four to six out there.\nPaul Brody: Yes. Sure. So the way we model it, the one hike was an increase of an expected $165 million for the year. We would model two hikes. And by that, I mean, over the first two quarters and then it remains there, each 25 basis points. That should add about another an additional $120 million annually. And three hikes in consecutive quarters would add about another $45 million. And so you have to understand what -- the dynamic here is that at two hikes, so then Fed funds would be around 57 or 58, let's say, basis points. We start to pay interest to our customers at Fed funds less 50 basis points, whereas right now, that number is zero. So therefore, after three hikes, we then ratchet up our -- the rates that we pay along with Fed funds. And the same thing happens on margin lending. So then we have a built-in spread, which is what we always used to have before rates dissolve down to close to zero. So that's why incrementally, it benefits us, but less and less. And of course, this is keeping all other things equal, meaning the current balances in margin lending and deposits and so forth.\nRichard Repetto: Okay. And the numbers I got -- and you can correct me, I'm sure. One of there is 165 the first, 120 the second, incrementally, and then the third 45?\nPaul Brody: Yes, those are just estimates, but -- yes. Each one is incremental to the previous. Yes.\nRichard Repetto: And beyond three, incrementally 45 as well?\nPaul Brody: We haven't modeled it -- so don't hold me to it, but it would be a number, no more than that. It depends on where the deposits fall in terms of the tiers. Are they small accounts? Are they medium-sized accounts? Are they large accounts? And that will dictate what happens as the rates change. Some are more interest rate sensitive than others.\nRichard Repetto: Got it. Thank you very much, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Nance of Goldman Sachs. Your question please.\nWill Nance: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Maybe I can start with a question on the growth, I think last quarter, you talked a little bit about some of the exhibition broker accounts that were on a fully disclosed basis, and we're going to move over to an omnibus structure. I was just wondering if that impacted some of the numbers recently and some of the metrics you guys have put out? And if you could just put a number of ballpark, how many have moved over and how much are left?\nThomas Peterffy: Yes. I think in December, an introducing broker rent to Omnibus with 2,800 accounts.\nWill Nance: Got it. Appreciate it. That's super helpful. And then I appreciate all the color on Richard's questions around interest rate sensitivity. Just you mentioned that, that didn't contemplate any changes in the reinvestment strategy. I was wondering if you could talk kind of more theoretically about what kind of steepness in the yield curve would you guys look to before you would be more - before you would consider taking a little bit more duration risk in the segregated cash portfolio, are we anywhere near where that's something you've been thinking about? Or is that still far way off?\nThomas Peterffy: No, we did not. I'm extremely worried about much higher interest rates, not because the Fed will move it there, but people will realize that they have to borrow money and leverage in order to keep up with inflation. And so I think that the fed will lose control.\nWill Nance: Got it. I appreciate you taking my questions today. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. I was hoping you could expand upon your confidence around options activity and the sustainability of it or actually the growth? I think you highlighted that you think will still continue. Maybe the -- I don't know if it's the profile of customer that is using it that's different than others across your complex, or is it education or other factors that you think that are -- that give you confidence around the sustainability there?\nThomas Peterffy: So I think the greatest factor here is that these developments that occur in the United States tend to be followed by in other countries with some lag, and that lag is sometimes quite long, like 5, 10 years. And so this huge increase in the U.S. recently is certainly going to be followed by customers outside of the U.S. And it is specifically the discovery by more and more people that upstream combined option combination positions can give you very interesting risk profiles and there is more and more of that based on fundamental analysis, so people tend to figure out that the stock could rise between $2 and $5. But not likely more and this type of forecast can be really harvested in the options market, then we just see a very big increase in these kinds of trades. And as I've said, I expect that to be followed by foreign investors. And we are going to be very light beneficiaries of debt.\nDan Fannon: Okay. That's helpful. And then last quarter, when you reiterated confidence around the account growth and the outlook, you cited some marketing -- new marketing programs and targeted I think, campaigns that kind of were part of that confidence. I guess could you expand a bit upon that if that's expanded, if you're allocating more dollars towards it or the real Reallocating more dollars, more resources, more brain power, yes. That's where our future lies, and we're pushing that very, very hard.\nDan Fannon: Okay. And from a budget perspective, as we think about 2022 or beyond in terms of the spend, is that something that will be noticeable in the income statement as you spend those dollars?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, unfortunately, I'm really at -- we're willing to spend any amount that makes sense, but we find very difficult, we find it very difficult to find places that we can sell a lot of money out because anytime we find a new channel and it works great for, say, $1 million. But if you double it, your return only goes up by, say, 5% or 10%. That's an incredibly frustrating. So we continuously have to look for new channels and put a little bit of money in there. And that is what we're doing so far. And we hope for a breakthrough, but it hasn't happened yet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America. Your question please.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thomas, I hope you're doing well. I'm doing well, too. So I want to come back to margin loan balances. I believe there were some pricing adjustments in the quarter, especially on your two highest tiers, $1 million to $50 million and over $50 million. I wanted to see if you could help us quantify any impact from a revenue or earnings standpoint that, that could actually drive and when we could see that results.\nThomas Peterffy:\n--:\nPaul Brody: Absolutely. So we talk firstly about the freight rises. But based on the new policy alone, our estimates were would add annually about $24 million. And some of that's from putting money into different rate tiers. Some of it is treatment of negative rate currencies. And there's pass-through of some of those costs. But that's our overall estimate.\nCraig Siegenthaler: I have to ask one on China just because it's been a big source of investor inbound. But -- Can you update us in terms of the 4Q revenue contribution from Mainland China or the two largest introducing broker clients that are there? And then based on the evolving stance from the Chinese government, around data and foreign firms, how do you expect the size of these relationships to trend over the next year?\nThomas Peterffy: So as you know, the two largest customers are Futu and Tiger, and they are leaving us. Futu has practically left us. They had a very few accounts still with us. And Tiger is in the process of doing that. As far as the Chinese, yes, I don't have a view on that. I'm very, very confused. Inside the Company, we're not in total agreement as to as to how to attack that. So I can't really tell you. I mean, some of my colleagues are looking more favorably the Chinese situation than I do.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt of KBW. Your line is open.\nKyle Voigt: Maybe I could ask first question about the IMPACT, the mobile app launch. Just wondering, if you could help us quantify kind of the uptake or maybe new account growth that contributed in the fourth quarter? And then also just wondering if you could speak to, how do you sort expect revenues related to that app to kind of show up? I noticed that in app, you are advertising a bit more the interactive advisers and sustainable portfolios that are kind of prebuilt in there. So should we think about some asset-based fees as being maybe a bigger driver of revenues as this grows over a longer period of time?\nThomas Peterffy: Well -- No. I mean, our asset base fees, we're only charging 8 basis points. So that will not create -- that's more like a bait to get people to come in. Now as far as the IMPACT app, I mean, we had 40,000 downloads of the IMPACT app. We are not -- we do not break out the revenues, but I wouldn't think that they would be substantial.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. And then I just sort of -- just want to go back to the interest rate sensitivity discussion. I believe in the second quarter, you had previously disclosed that roughly 14% of the customer credit balances, what was about $11 billion at the time, were fully rate sensitive, or I guess, noninterest-bearing. So I'm assuming that's really the cash in those small accounts are below that $10,000 threshold in total cash balances. I guess, is that still the right percentage to think about? And that 14% of total credit balances, or maybe you could provide an update to that $11 billion number, just as we think about modeling, again, those kind of capturing the rate benefit past those first two hikes. Yes, sure. So the -- it's still in the 14% to 15% range.\nThomas Peterffy: That's not right. So the 14% to 15% range are the monies that they account as, let's say, $100,000 in it, right? So...\nPaul Brody: Well, they're in a number of categories under, $10,000, for example.\nThomas Peterffy: But that's only one of them.\nPaul Brody: Yes. We have a number of categories that total up to about 14.5%.\nThomas Peterffy: Yes. But so the bulk of those folks have the money gets [have] interest.\nPaul Brody: But only on the one category of under $100,000, the amount between $10,000 and $100,000 gets a proportionate amount of interest that we would pay.\nThomas Peterffy: But the bulk of the $11 billion is there.\nPaul Brody: No, the bulk is in the very smallest accounts, under $10,000. And commodity accounts where we don't pay interest actually contribute a non-trivial amount, and...\nThomas Peterffy: So you're saying that we have $11 billion in account under $10,000?\nPaul Brody: That number is about $7 billion out of a total of fully interest rate sensitive balances of about $12 billion.\nThomas Peterffy: Okay. I want to arguably see it.\nPaul Brody: Commodity balances, they're almost $3 billion. So between the two of them, it's most of it.\nKyle Voigt: Okay. Maybe if I can just turn to -- turn to expenses, and then I'll jump back in the queue. Can you just help us think about the level of fixed expense growth as we're looking out into 2022? You mentioned that there's only -- you're only going to invest, obviously, if there's a positive ROI on the marketing spend. So I hear you there. But I guess when you're thinking about that fixed expense base as a whole and just hiring and everything else that goes into that, can you just talk about the pace of growth into '22?\nOperator: Next question comes from Rich Repetto of Piper Stanley. Your line is open.\nRichard Repetto: Yes. My follow-up, I guess, has to do with the holiday, the OCC holiday where they didn't charge you. And I think it was for two months, but -- I guess, Paul, could you tell us how long the holiday -- was it for the entire quarter? And how much was it? I know it doesn't impact your profitability at all? And then any way to estimate how it might impact weighed on your average commission?\nPaul Brody: Right. So it wasn't a very big number. It was the last two months of the year. OCC over time has taken various approaches to their fee charging. What they used to do is charge even more about $0.05, $0.055 contract and then rebate it the next year. What they did this past year was they started high and then they cut it in the middle of the year, and then they looked at their financials and cut it to zero for the last two months. The number, it's $2 million plus for us, somewhere in that range. So it's not extensive. You're right to point out that most of that savings is passed through the customers; however, some of it is not because for customers who choose fixed as opposed to tiered pricing, we would get the benefit of that. Probably most of it is passed through.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Allen of Compass Point. Please go ahead.\nChris Allen: Just wanted to ask on execution and clearing. The fee impact is helpful there. You talked about the impact of the smart order router internalization on your ATS. And then obviously, there's been the competitive dynamic among exchanges I'm wondering if you can just walk through maybe over the last two years, what's had the biggest impact in terms of lowering execution and clearing fees as a percentage of commissions. Any thoughts in terms of maybe on the exchange side, what the impact would be if some of the inverter pricing we've seen now goes away moving forward can't answer you there, but maybe Paul, can you?\nPaul Brody: Yes, I can give a little bit of color. So one aspect is that our smart routers -- the smart router has become better and better at routing orders to places that will still give the best price to the exchange, but give a better rebate, and when we talk about the spread between our commission revenue and our direct costs, these execution and clearing costs going up. That's because $1 saved or rebated and then passed through to the customer has a smaller percentage impact on the commission revenue than it does on the expense line, which is small to begin with. So each dollar we get, even if we pass the full thing through to the customer, the percentage spread would continue to increase. Of course, the other thing is that as we attract more and more orders to our ATS, there's no external cost to executing those at all, and that simply reduces the cost line.\nChris Allen: Got it. And maybe -- Just one quick one on other fees and services. I know you talked through it, but we had a really hard time to understand some of the details there. Maybe if you can just repeat that real quick just in terms of, I think, what the key growth drivers were on that what -- the year-over-year perspective?\nPaul Brody: Well, over the current period, the drivers were market data. Market data is also offset by an expense, and we earned some profit on it, but it's -- When we talk about the other case and services, that's the revenue side of it, exposure fees. So we charge, as we've talked about in the past, we run stress scenarios on every client account. And when the stress scenario, which is a more conservative measure of risk than the margin system would impose when they reach a certain level, the system begins to charge fees, which is intended to encourage the customer to reduce their own risk or carry it at -- hopefully proportionately higher fee to us, and we collect those fees over time. So those happen to have gone up. And then the options exchange payments the payment programs mandated by the options exchanges go up with volume. And so that's the third component -- major component of what's been driving up the other fees and services.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: I have a follow-up here on crypto trading and the partnership with Paxos. Can you just update us on your progress to add more coins? And if I think about your 1.7 million accounts, how many of them are active in trading cryptocurrencies today? And have you seen your crypto offering accelerate organic growth?\nThomas Peterffy: So we are going to add most probably two currencies and possibly two more within a month. The probable ones will be linked and matic and the possible one will be UV, UNI and AAVE. We are also working on so, but that we not be added until towards the end of the quarter. Your question about...\nCraig Siegenthaler: My second question was: Out of your 1.7 million accounts, how many are active in trading crypto today? And then also, are you seeing crypto drive new clients to Interactive Brokers?\nThomas Peterffy: We are seeing a small number of new clients coming to us because of crypto. And the take-up among our existing clients is kind of disappointing. So I think that we have not been successful in driving home the message that our commission rates are 2/3 lower than the next lowest provider. And all the problem is that we do not have or the popular currencies and people cannot trade against each other on our platform.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thomas, and I just had one follow-up here. And this one may be even better for Paul because it's more of a financial question. But we've seen your clearing and execution cost really decline on a long-term basis relative to trading activity and commissions at shipping some operating leverage and some efficiencies. What is your thoughts on the future of that trend? Will that benefit continue into the future?\nPaul Brody: We certainly hope so. We hope that the marketplace will give us more and better opportunities to have our smart router be better. And we always look for those opportunities and we look to improve on the software. And as I said before, the more volume we can attract into our own ATS that will there's no associated external cost with those executions. And so we hope to be very successful with that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mac Sykes of Gabelli. Your line is open.\nMac Sykes: I have two questions. I mean, your capital generation continues to be amazing, and then hopefully, the uptick with the interest revenue. And I assume that you have not changed your stance on wanting to bolster your balance sheet. But you had talked in the past about having some more capital for funding foreign margin. Is that still the case? Are you still seeing demand kind of outside the U.S. to be able to fund those margin balances?\nPaul Brody: Yes. Basically, the answer is yes.\nMac Sykes: Okay. And then on crypto, for those adopters, what are the policies related to using margin? And are you seeing some customers?\nPaul Brody: We are not allowing margins -- We -- I have heard Mr. Gensler say that if you leverage a crypto then it's certainly the security.\nMac Sykes: And are you going to be able to offer short abilities for that and financing off of the currency holdings in the future?\nPaul Brody: As I said, we cannot finance crypto. No, we will not plan right Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Your question please.\nDan Fannon: Just Thomas wanted to ask about your confidence around the account growth of 30% to 40% as we look at the Fed futures outlook for the level of heights that are currently being contemplated, how do you think that could change your account growth trajectory or as I said earlier, your confidence around that?\nThomas Peterffy: I think if markets remain at current levels or go lower by less than 10%. And -- And if there is not a huge international catastrophe like some more then I think that this rate of increase will continue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle Voit of KBW. Your line is open.\nKyle Voit: Thanks for taking my follow-up. I just wanted to circle back. I don't know if my audio was coming through previously. I'm just wondering if you could help us think about the level of fixed expense growth heading into 2022. I don't know if that's better for Paul or.\nPaul Brody: No, I think an assumption of -- so we're basically talking about communications, computers, salaries and wages right? I think about vehicle assume at 15% growth rate or you have any time up here?\nKyle Voit: No, I have no other opinion than yours on that topic. Got it. Thank you. And then just a clarity question on the fourth quarter margin yields, they compressed to about 114 basis points. I think last quarter, they were 120 basis points. I'm assuming that was just mix in terms of the balanced tiers in the fourth quarter. Is that right, Paul?\nPaul Brody: Actually, Kyle, last quarter, you did mean in the third quarter as a comparator.\nKyle Voit: Yes, the third quarter was 120 basis points in the third quarter, it was $1.14.\nPaul Brody: I've got $113 million in the third quarter and $114 million in the fourth quarter. Maybe we should both go back and check.\nOperator: Okay. All right. Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Nancy Stuebe for closing remarks. Nancy?\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website. And we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thanks again, and we will talk to you next quarter end.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. He will handle the Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the Company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the Company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial statements filed with the SEC. 2021 was a good year for Interactive Brokers. Adjusted revenues were $2.78 billion, up 26% for the year, and expenses were well controlled, resulting in a pretax profit margin that improved from 61% to 67%, by far the highest in the industry. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year were $3.37, and that was 35% higher than the previous year. We look back at 2021 as one with unprecedented global investor engagement with the market. The only better year we can see is 2022. Let me explain why. In 2021, we added more customers, over 600,000; and did more trades, over 2.5 million DARTs per day, than we ever have before. We introduced more products and more tools while also expanding many existing ones and to assist with our continuing growth we hired and trained nearly 450 new employees around the world. Our year-on-year account growth was 56% this year. I've been saying for some time that after this unusually active period we have been experiencing a period that seems to keep growing longer, we will see account growth closer to between 30% and 40% a year. But that does not mean that we will not do almost anything we can think of to try to keep it above those levels. We introduced more new products and expanded the capabilities of existing ones. Recognizing our global customer reach, we introduced global analyst, which allows our clients to discover undervalued companies from a wide database of global stocks. We introduced our crypto offering. U.S. individuals, RIAs, hedge funds and introducing brokers as well as individuals in over 100 different countries can now all trade crypto through our partner, Paxos. Very shortly, we will be offering crypto for our international financial advisers, iBrokers and hedge funds in those countries, and we will add more countries continually. We charged just 0.12% to 0.18% of trade value with a minimum $1.75 per trade. We rolled out our ESG-focused impact app, which brings transparency and a streamlined, simplified platform to help clients find and invest in companies that share their values. Impact also allows them to make cash donations to thousands of different U.S. charities directly from the app. We also introduced U.S. spot gold trading and these are just a few of the items we have been working on, and we have other exciting products and improvements in various stages in advance of being rolled out. As 2021 drew to a close, IBKR was able to produce its second best quarter of the year after the hyperactive mean stock events of the first quarter. But the story of the mean stocks will fade in the minds of investors, while the most remarkable story of the year, the huge rise in popularity of options and more specifically, option spreads will remain. As someone who has spent the last 50 years trying to automate the options industry, I very much welcome this development. For a long time, Interactive Brokers was alone trying to stir up industry interest to computerize these markets. But now finally, people are beginning to understand what fantastic versatile instruments options are. I am predicting further growth, especially internationally. Option spreads give traders the opportunity to assume very specific and limited risk reward profile for specific periods of time. Please visit our probability lab on the IBKR website for a fun way to think about, learn about and play with options. As the year were on, listed options saw an average daily volume of nearly 40 million contracts and Interactive Brokers customers responsible for roughly 10% of daily options volume. This is even more than in equities, where we are only about 7%. Execution quality is most important for options traders, especially for options spread traders, where profits and losses tend to be limited and every penny matters. Even the minimum price difference of $0.01 amounts to $1 a contract and bid offer spreads in the market regularly get as wide as $0.05 to $0.10. Interactive Brokers does not accept payment for order flow for IBKR Pro customer orders. We auction off each option order among 16 top market makers. We are always happy to welcome more to this group. These auctions last something on the order of 100 milliseconds, and the winner chooses which exchange it wants to use to trade with the order. IBKR then posts the order for an exchange auction. And if nobody improves on the agreed-upon price, the original winner of the auction trades the contract at that price. This may sound like a rather involved process, but practice it all happens in a fraction of a second. All participants use automated processes and they automatically feed the amount of price improvement they are interested in competing on for any specific option contracts they trade with at that specific point in time. In this way, our customers can take advantage of a leading-edge system designed to get them the best available price. Having been the largest market makers and options for over 30 years, IBKR is very well versed in these processes, many of which we have retained from our Market Maker Day, and we have been keeping them up to date over the years. As new exchanges and new rules are continuously introduced, this is not an easy task, and we have a team of programmers regularly engaged in this activity. Imagine if payments for order flow were prohibited, and all brokers are forced to execute their own customer orders. Sophisticated mechanisms like the ones we developed and use would be expensive and take a long time for others to create. While the idea is interesting to think about, I do not think that it is about to happen anytime soon. Another notable development for IBKR in 2021 was a 40% increase in margin loans over the course of the year. I think this growth will also continue into the future. With 7% inflation as the background, stock prices will have to rise by 7% just to retain the relative value. I believe inflation will continue at a high rate. There is very little the Fed can do about it. They may raise interest rates to 1% or 2%. We would not borrow at that rate and invest in leveraged assets. Even if the Fed funds rate rises to 3%, Interactive Brokers will end at 3.75% to people who want to buy stock, whether or not they combine it with option strategies. The 3% is not likely. A slightly over 3% interest rate would add $1 trillion to annual U.S. debt service and to deficit spending, which would just further increase inflationary pressures. Inflation is here to stay. We'll have to learn to live with it and margin lending will continue to grow along with it. We aim to grow our businesses by growing our customer base. We will continue to introduce new platforms, products and research and trading tools to attract new customers of the type that fit our target, serious, hard-working and educated investors who come to us to succeed with the help of our execution quality and products and services. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody. Paul? Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website. And we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thanks again, and we will talk to you next quarter end."

            "name": "Paul Brody",
            "content": "Thank you, Nancy, and welcome, everyone, to our IBKR fourth quarter results and then [indiscernible]. Starting with our revenue items on Page 3 of the release. We're pleased the record results during the June quarter, we believe the robust growth of customer positions us well what our transactional [indiscernible]. Conditions continue to be strong, returning our second highest ever quarterly revenues [indiscernible] investment [indiscernible]. We've got substantially higher trading volumes, stock and options, [indiscernible] coming from our large [indiscernible]. Net interest income was strong, generating $295 million of revenue. Also our second highest quarterly performance and this will record full year and leading to a record full year NII of 32% of [indiscernible]. Margin lending remained strong. Investor confidence in market remains [indiscernible]. Securities list also [indiscernible] strong. [indiscernible] showing investment demand rolling broad range here in borrower [indiscernible], lead by a growing [indiscernible]. We generated $58 million of revenue and other fees and services $215 million for the year, 25% despite the midyear [indiscernible]. Strong client activity drove revenues higher. Market data [indiscernible] reached $20 million, up 15% [indiscernible] exposure growth over [indiscernible] as higher volumes, [indiscernible] 0.3% higher [indiscernible]. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our current diversification strategy, and [indiscernible] transaction. Many of these noncore items are excluded in our adjusted earnings. Without those items, other income would be $10 million in the quarter, $54 million. Turning to expenses. Execution, clearing and distribution costs were down even with these [indiscernible] $53 million costs from deposit where down 20% from a year ago quarter and down 19% for the full year. As a percent of traditional revenue, execution and clearing costs are driven by trading costs, declined to 22% in 2020, 13% in 2021. Our customers continue to benefit from the execution fee reductions achieved by our [indiscernible]. This quarter, the costs were reduced by lower regulatory fees [indiscernible]. I've transferred to a headset. I'm hoping that maybe my audio comes over a little bit better. So this quarter, the costs were also reduced by lower regulatory fees as the SEC lowered the rate on U.S. stocks and by a temporary fee holiday on U.S. options by the OCC. Because these benefits are largely passed through to our customers, both costs and commission revenue decreased accordingly. As a result of our order routing improvements, which include utilizing our low-cost IBKR ATS for stock execution, a greater portion of our commission revenue goes to the bottom line. Our ratio of compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenues was 18% for the quarter and 15% for the year, relatively unchanged from last year despite a 26% increase in the headcount. We continue to focus on expense discipline, while improving our strong top line. Our head count at year-end was 2,571. G&A expenses were up 27% from the year ago quarter, though down 25% for the full year, reflecting lower legal expenses on litigation, partially offset by higher spending on advertising and required fees. Our adjusted pretax margin remained a robust 66% by practicing expense control while also hiring and investing in the business for accelerated growth, we continue to maintain the operating leverage in our business. Finally, on the income tax line of the $35 million shown, the operating company's portion was $19 million and the public company's portion was $16 million. Moving to our balance sheet on Page 5 of the release, our total assets ended the year at $109 billion, with growth driven by margin lending to customers. Our consolidated equity capital was $10.2 billion, having reached the $10 billion mark for the first time last quarter. We have no long-term debt. We continue to deploy our balance sheet to support our growing client business in particular. More and larger customers want access to margin lending, which our capital base gives us the ability to provide. We opened two offices in Europe in response to Brexit. For those in our other rapidly growing international locations, our capital base provides the foundation needed today's operations and for future growth. Our capital is also used for numerous other growth and investment opportunities we see worldwide. And finally, an ample capital base helps us win business by showing the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners. Let's now look briefly at our operating data on Pages 6 and 7 of the release. Page 6 shows contract and share volumes for all customers rose 46% in options, well above industry growth, and 19% in futures. While our stock share volume fell 3%, the product mix produced a 1% increase in commissions. Activity is strong across client types and geographies. In most securities products, our volumes are well above the high average activity level of 2020. Turning to Page 7. Account growth remains robust with over 600,000 net new account adds for the year. Total accounts reached 1.68 million, up 56% over the prior year and 9% over the prior quarter. Customer equity growth reflected strength in new accounts, solid additions to existing accounts and a generally supportive market environment. Total customer DARTs reached their second highest quarterly level at over 2.4 million trades per day. This reflected investor confidence in rising markets, the ongoing global search for yield in zero and negative interest rate environment and more customers on our trading platform. Commission per cleared commissionable order continues to show our success in capturing rebates paid by exchanges for our clients. When we route IBKR Pro orders directly to exchanges, we realize these exchange rebates and pass the savings on to our clients by lowering their commissions. Our cleared IBKR Pro customers paid $2.38, 3% less per order than they did last year, as our order routing system found opportunities to maximize rebates while achieving best price execution. Our clients benefit with lower commission costs as we pass our lower execution and clearing costs on to them. Profitability per order to us remains the same. Turning to net interest margin. We break down our net interest margin on Page 8. Total GAAP net interest income was $295 million for the quarter and $1.15 billion for the year, both up over 30% from a year ago, reflecting, in particular, increases in margin lending and securities lending. Average margin loan balances were up 58% for both the quarter and the full year, leading to increases in margin loan interest income of 60% and 41% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Investors remain comfortable taking on leverage in the current rising market environment. Securities lending net interest was up 17% and driven by strong client participation in the markets. As our customer base grows, our opportunities to lend customers shares to other customers who shorten those stocks also grow. Together with increasing our profitable securities lending to other broker-dealers, the model generates expanding revenues. We believe our proprietary system developed in-house for securities lending and operated by our team of specialists. This is proficient in identifying and lending out securities and high demand, which drives our revenue from this activity. Moving to net interest from segregated cash and from customer credit balances. This continues to reflect the impact of negative benchmark rates in certain countries. When benchmark rates are very low as they are in the U.S., we pay no interest to customers on their cash. But in currencies where rates are negative, we earn interest by passing through these negative rates to customers. We earned $8 million on these balances. When benchmark rates are positive, we earn interest on depositing, investing our segregated cash balances. But because of negative rates in some currencies, we had a net cost of $5 million on these balances. Taken together, the net interest income from these balances was $3 million for the quarter. Now our estimate of the impact and increase in U.S. interest rates, we expect the next 25 basis point rise in rates to produce an additional $165 million annually. The increase from past estimates is driven by higher margin loan balances and also follows our introduction of new interest rate tiers and spreads on January 3 of this year. This does not take into account any change in how we may adjust our investment strategy to take advantage of newly higher rates or a change in our assets. About 24% of our customer cash balances are not in U.S. dollars. So estimates of the impact of U.S. rate changes exclude those currencies. As forecasted, Federal Reserve rate consensus for 2022 centers around more than one hike. We can add that a second hike would produce a similar, although somewhat lower annual benefit to the first. In conclusion, we had a strong quarter to close out a record year, reflecting our ability to grow our customer base and product set, and that shows the attractiveness of our strategy to automate for growth, expanding what we offer while minimizing what we charge. Given our progress and performance, we are confident in our ability to grow accounts, as Thomas has indicated, maintain our expense discipline and to capture future opportunities as they arise. With that, I'll turn it back over to the moderator, and we will field some questions. Yes, we can. Yes. Yes. Sure. So the way we model it, the one hike was an increase of an expected $165 million for the year. We would model two hikes. And by that, I mean, over the first two quarters and then it remains there, each 25 basis points. That should add about another an additional $120 million annually. And three hikes in consecutive quarters would add about another $45 million. And so you have to understand what -- the dynamic here is that at two hikes, so then Fed funds would be around 57 or 58, let's say, basis points. We start to pay interest to our customers at Fed funds less 50 basis points, whereas right now, that number is zero. So therefore, after three hikes, we then ratchet up our -- the rates that we pay along with Fed funds. And the same thing happens on margin lending. So then we have a built-in spread, which is what we always used to have before rates dissolve down to close to zero. So that's why incrementally, it benefits us, but less and less. And of course, this is keeping all other things equal, meaning the current balances in margin lending and deposits and so forth. Yes, those are just estimates, but -- yes. Each one is incremental to the previous. Yes. We haven't modeled it -- so don't hold me to it, but it would be a number, no more than that. It depends on where the deposits fall in terms of the tiers. Are they small accounts? Are they medium-sized accounts? Are they large accounts? And that will dictate what happens as the rates change. Some are more interest rate sensitive than others. Absolutely. So we talk firstly about the freight rises. But based on the new policy alone, our estimates were would add annually about $24 million. And some of that's from putting money into different rate tiers. Some of it is treatment of negative rate currencies. And there's pass-through of some of those costs. But that's our overall estimate. Well, they're in a number of categories under, $10,000, for example. Yes. We have a number of categories that total up to about 14.5%. But only on the one category of under $100,000, the amount between $10,000 and $100,000 gets a proportionate amount of interest that we would pay. No, the bulk is in the very smallest accounts, under $10,000. And commodity accounts where we don't pay interest actually contribute a non-trivial amount, and... That number is about $7 billion out of a total of fully interest rate sensitive balances of about $12 billion. Commodity balances, they're almost $3 billion. So between the two of them, it's most of it. Right. So it wasn't a very big number. It was the last two months of the year. OCC over time has taken various approaches to their fee charging. What they used to do is charge even more about $0.05, $0.055 contract and then rebate it the next year. What they did this past year was they started high and then they cut it in the middle of the year, and then they looked at their financials and cut it to zero for the last two months. The number, it's $2 million plus for us, somewhere in that range. So it's not extensive. You're right to point out that most of that savings is passed through the customers; however, some of it is not because for customers who choose fixed as opposed to tiered pricing, we would get the benefit of that. Probably most of it is passed through. Yes, I can give a little bit of color. So one aspect is that our smart routers -- the smart router has become better and better at routing orders to places that will still give the best price to the exchange, but give a better rebate, and when we talk about the spread between our commission revenue and our direct costs, these execution and clearing costs going up. That's because $1 saved or rebated and then passed through to the customer has a smaller percentage impact on the commission revenue than it does on the expense line, which is small to begin with. So each dollar we get, even if we pass the full thing through to the customer, the percentage spread would continue to increase. Of course, the other thing is that as we attract more and more orders to our ATS, there's no external cost to executing those at all, and that simply reduces the cost line. Well, over the current period, the drivers were market data. Market data is also offset by an expense, and we earned some profit on it, but it's -- When we talk about the other case and services, that's the revenue side of it, exposure fees. So we charge, as we've talked about in the past, we run stress scenarios on every client account. And when the stress scenario, which is a more conservative measure of risk than the margin system would impose when they reach a certain level, the system begins to charge fees, which is intended to encourage the customer to reduce their own risk or carry it at -- hopefully proportionately higher fee to us, and we collect those fees over time. So those happen to have gone up. And then the options exchange payments the payment programs mandated by the options exchanges go up with volume. And so that's the third component -- major component of what's been driving up the other fees and services. We certainly hope so. We hope that the marketplace will give us more and better opportunities to have our smart router be better. And we always look for those opportunities and we look to improve on the software. And as I said before, the more volume we can attract into our own ATS that will there's no associated external cost with those executions. And so we hope to be very successful with that. Yes. Basically, the answer is yes. We are not allowing margins -- We -- I have heard Mr. Gensler say that if you leverage a crypto then it's certainly the security. As I said, we cannot finance crypto. No, we will not plan right Okay. No, I think an assumption of -- so we're basically talking about communications, computers, salaries and wages right? I think about vehicle assume at 15% growth rate or you have any time up here? Actually, Kyle, last quarter, you did mean in the third quarter as a comparator. I've got $113 million in the third quarter and $114 million in the fourth quarter. Maybe we should both go back and check."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Thomas Peterffy",
            "content": "Okay. You're absolutely right. So, many years ago, we put in a commission limit so that we would never charge more than 50 basis points on a stock trade. And that slowly brought more and more low-priced stock traders to us. Eventually, it appears that there are some regulatory concerns about the stock trading, and we have successfully reduced it. It's got no income impact whatsoever. It's -- those are very tiny numbers. Yes. I think in December, an introducing broker rent to Omnibus with 2,800 accounts. No, we did not. I'm extremely worried about much higher interest rates, not because the Fed will move it there, but people will realize that they have to borrow money and leverage in order to keep up with inflation. And so I think that the fed will lose control. So I think the greatest factor here is that these developments that occur in the United States tend to be followed by in other countries with some lag, and that lag is sometimes quite long, like 5, 10 years. And so this huge increase in the U.S. recently is certainly going to be followed by customers outside of the U.S. And it is specifically the discovery by more and more people that upstream combined option combination positions can give you very interesting risk profiles and there is more and more of that based on fundamental analysis, so people tend to figure out that the stock could rise between $2 and $5. But not likely more and this type of forecast can be really harvested in the options market, then we just see a very big increase in these kinds of trades. And as I've said, I expect that to be followed by foreign investors. And we are going to be very light beneficiaries of debt. Well, unfortunately, I'm really at -- we're willing to spend any amount that makes sense, but we find very difficult, we find it very difficult to find places that we can sell a lot of money out because anytime we find a new channel and it works great for, say, $1 million. But if you double it, your return only goes up by, say, 5% or 10%. That's an incredibly frustrating. So we continuously have to look for new channels and put a little bit of money in there. And that is what we're doing so far. And we hope for a breakthrough, but it hasn't happened yet. --: So as you know, the two largest customers are Futu and Tiger, and they are leaving us. Futu has practically left us. They had a very few accounts still with us. And Tiger is in the process of doing that. As far as the Chinese, yes, I don't have a view on that. I'm very, very confused. Inside the Company, we're not in total agreement as to as to how to attack that. So I can't really tell you. I mean, some of my colleagues are looking more favorably the Chinese situation than I do. Well -- No. I mean, our asset base fees, we're only charging 8 basis points. So that will not create -- that's more like a bait to get people to come in. Now as far as the IMPACT app, I mean, we had 40,000 downloads of the IMPACT app. We are not -- we do not break out the revenues, but I wouldn't think that they would be substantial. That's not right. So the 14% to 15% range are the monies that they account as, let's say, $100,000 in it, right? So... But that's only one of them. Yes. But so the bulk of those folks have the money gets [have] interest. But the bulk of the $11 billion is there. So you're saying that we have $11 billion in account under $10,000? Okay. I want to arguably see it. So we are going to add most probably two currencies and possibly two more within a month. The probable ones will be linked and matic and the possible one will be UV, UNI and AAVE. We are also working on so, but that we not be added until towards the end of the quarter. Your question about... We are seeing a small number of new clients coming to us because of crypto. And the take-up among our existing clients is kind of disappointing. So I think that we have not been successful in driving home the message that our commission rates are 2/3 lower than the next lowest provider. And all the problem is that we do not have or the popular currencies and people cannot trade against each other on our platform. I think if markets remain at current levels or go lower by less than 10%. And -- And if there is not a huge international catastrophe like some more then I think that this rate of increase will continue."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Interactive Brokers Group Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Nancy Stuebe, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. He will handle the Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the Company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature are not certain and are outside of the Company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. In the third quarter, we once again reached a record number of accounts, 1,536,000. Our year-over-year account growth of 57% was nearly equal in all three of our geographic regions. The markets continued to be constructive for us, but more normalized than they were last year driving commissions to $311 million, the second highest we have ever reported only exceeded by this year's hyperactive first quarter. While our GAAP reported net revenues were $464 million, our adjusted net revenues of $650 million were also our second highest on record, again surpassed only by the first quarter. The $186 million adjustment to net revenues was virtually all due to the depreciation of Tiger Brokers' stock price. We invested in Tiger at a blended price of less than $3 a share in 2018 and 2019 to help them gather enough capital to enter into the brokerage business on the large scale they wanted using our platform as an introducing broker. Since that time, the stock has traded as high as $38 and as low as $3, and at quarter end, our gain on this investment was about $80 million. Even though this started out as a relatively minor investment, it certainly has provided a lot of unintended distraction to our investors who look at our financials. With the new focus on the part of the Chinese government on data security, we now expect the stock to keep swinging for a while until they come to a clear understanding with the regulator of what is required and how to get there. Our financial performance underscores the strength of our platform and of our focus on automating as much of the brokerage business as possible. This gives us the ability to maximize our product and service offering while minimizing our costs. Automation to us means that our 1.5 million customers from all over the world can interact and trade securities, commodities and currencies with each other across 141 trading venues in many jurisdictions under different rules, seemingly from one account. This is not easy. And it is the reason that not all products on our platform are available for all users, such as crypto, which is not yet available to many of our non-U.S. customers, but we are working hard on that. We just yesterday enabled registered investment advisors to add small crypto positions to the investment portfolios of clients who requested it, which we are told happens ever more often. Automation also enables us to generate upon request, a single, nicely compiled investment report that not only summarizes your holdings and returns and the risk you have been taking but does so across continents and products and currencies. And you can even custom tailor it for yourself or for your customers, column by column. We've even added the capability to include assets that are custodied elsewhere and incorporate them into this report no matter what country or major currency they are in. We continue to see active trading among our client base. To give a sense of this, in the third quarter of 2019, our equity volume was 41 billion shares. In the third quarter of 2020, it was 86 billion shares. This quarter, it reached 172 billion shares. Third quarter total DARTs of 2.3 million were the third highest in company history, following the first two quarters of this year, as existing clients continue their activity and new clients begin to participate. Client investing confidence can also be seen in our customer margin loans, which reached a record $50.2 billion, up 67% from last year. We continue to see our clients putting their available funds to work. $50 billion of margin loans represents about 6% of all outstanding industry margin loans, even though we only hold less than a fraction of 1% of all investable assets. This is also remarkable because our margin lending policies are comparatively conservative, and we automatically liquidate positions and accounts that come into violation of these policies. The reason for our high margin balance is that we only charge 0.75% to 1.56% to IBKR Pro customers for margin loans. This policy is a major draw for sophisticated traders to trade often and use leverage. The more our clients participate, the stronger we become. Our reported pretax profit margin was 50% and adjusted for non-core items was 65%. We know of no other broker who can claim profit margins close to this. Our new account growth remains quite positive ahead of both prior year and prior quarter adds. Investor confidence and activity are strong across the globe in all regions as we emerge from the pandemic. This activity continues to be led more by individual investors who tend to stay with us, especially internationally, because we offer a broad product range in the lowest cost to those investors, and there are many who wish to invest globally. This breadth is one of our strategic advantages, one that is extremely difficult to offer. For any broker providing market access can be expensive and complex. To do so globally with compliance, legal, currency, and tax and reporting requirements that vary by market is even more so. Having all this automated is our competitive advantage. Three quarters of our accounts are international in rapidly growing markets. Even as we come through this period of COVID, global interest in the markets that began early last year continues. People have grown comfortable doing more and more of their financial business electronically. They have grown more connected to financial markets, institutions and each other online, which in turn drives even more people to participate. This, along with our continuing dedication to add more products and services to our platform is why we believe year-over-year growth of total accounts can be at least 30% going forward indefinitely. Once again, all client segments and geographies showed strong account adds with all regions showing greater than 55% year-on-year account growth. Now, I will go over our five client segments. Individual customers who made up 64% of our accounts, 37% of our client equity, and 54% of our commissions continued their remarkable run of growth with 12-month account growth of 79%, client equity growth of 57%, and commissions of 35%. All geographic regions we serve saw growth in individual accounts of over 70% with European accounts topping all regions with over 90% growth. This underscores what we always say, it is important to provide a reliable platform that is global because people around the world want to maximize their opportunities to invest in the variety of ways they prefer. Hedge fund customers also continued to grow. For the 12 months ended September 30, we saw 4% hedge fund account growth, 41% customer equity growth, and 4% commission growth. We continued to add growing and larger hedge funds, which can be seen in the particularly robust growth in client equity in this segment. Hedge funds represent 1% of our accounts, 7% of our client equity, and 6% of our commissions. According to Preqin, we moved from eighth to seventh place as the prime broker servicing the most single manager hedge funds. We are in first place as the prime broker servicing the most hedge funds with under $50 million in AUM. And for the second year in a row, we are the fastest-growing prime broker. Proprietary trading firms are 2% of our accounts, 9% of our client equity and 12% of commissions. For the quarter, this group grew by 36% in accounts for the 12-month period, 44% in client equity and 19% in commissions. All regions saw strong growth. We are seeing particular success in this segment in Europe as more prop trading firms open and new and existing firms move to us due to our unusually diverse international product base, to capitalize on our reputation for seamless, efficient and favorable trade executions and as investors seek to counterbalance negative interest rates in the EU. Financial advisors are 9% of our accounts, 17% of our customer equity and 10% of our commissions. This group grew accounts by 19% for the 12-month period, customer equity by 41% and commissions by 7%. Account and client equity growth in this segment tends to be higher than commission growth as advisors typically tend to trade more conservatively. More larger advisor firms are beginning to try Interactive Brokers for our adaptable account structures where you can manage hedge funds, SMAs and regular client accounts under one master and invest across the world in a wide variety of products that now includes crypto. And RIA can use a rich set of tools and capabilities and with our dedicated client service desk for advisors, we continue to get better and capture more business globally. Our final segment is introducing brokers. These represent 25% of our accounts, 30% of our client equity and 17% of our commissions. IBroker segment account growth was 31% for the latest 12 months, with client equity up 59% and commissions up 97%. Offering the ticket of global access to their customers is critical for brokers looking to grow their business. Worldwide, new brokers starting up and existing brokers looking to extend the breadth and depth of their offerings turn to our platform for its global trading and seamless back-office functionality. With the worldwide growth in investors who want global access, introducing brokers know that their best opportunity to succeed is to partner with us to provide it. Much was done to enhance and improve our platform this quarter. We eliminated monthly inactivity fees, part of our ongoing commitment to provide low-cost training solutions. We introduced Bitcoin early last month in response to client demand. Over the next few months, we will be broadening both the regions and types of customers and coins available on our platform. We are very proud of the great advances we have made in building out our compliance systems and staff, in a group that now numbers 350 across the many regional brokerage subsidiaries we have around the world, each with its own unique rules and regulations. We've increased the yield on our advertising dollars, to a point at which it is becoming profitable to spend more. We have grown our sales force, and they are gaining stride. As Interactive Brokers becomes better known for the sophistication and diverse capabilities of our platform, along with our industry low pricing, it is easier and easier for them to attract new and larger customers. The growing controversy and focus on payment for order flow is to our advantage. Due to our unique position in the PFOF space, where we provide either zero commissions or executions at a small commission crossing at usually better prices in our ATS, we have a great opportunity to attract more institutional flow. They love to trade against our often overseen retail flow in between the NBBO, where both sides benefit. All in all, it is a thrill for us to keep building new things and adding more and more products and capabilities and to offer it to an ever-growing audience at the same time. It feels like our opportunities are, for the moment, unlimited, but we must hurry because the empty unserved product space is filling in quickly. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul?\nPaul Brody: Thank you, Nancy. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call. I'll review the third quarter results, and then we'll open it up for questions. Please first note, we have reordered our earnings release a bit to more closely align with many readers' expectations. So I'll start with our revenue items on Page 3 of the release. Commissions continue to be strong, returning our second highest ever quarterly revenues of $311 million. This reflects higher trading volumes, especially in stocks and options from active customers and a groundswell of new customers on our platform. Net interest income generated $274 million in revenues. Margin lending was particularly strong this quarter, with customers producing $141 million in margin interest, reflecting their confidence in the market. Securities lending also continued its strong run as investor demand for a broad range of securities to borrow was met with a growing supply of inventory held by our customers. We generated $49 million in revenues from other fees and services, even while discontinuing account in activity fees. Strong client activity drove revenues higher in market data fees and risk exposure fees, and income from options exchanged liquidity payments was driven higher by options volume. Market data fees were $20 million, up 21%. Risk exposure fees more than doubled to $8 million, and exchange liquidity payments were $10 million, up 51%. We eliminated account inactivity fees on July 1 to further improve account retention. We believe the trade-off will be worth it for the long-term growth of the business. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Many of these are excluded in our adjusted earnings. Outside of those, other income was up to $16 million. Turning to expenses. Execution, clearing and distribution costs were down 18% despite the higher trading volume, capturing exchange liquidity rebates through our state-of-the-art order routing system drove this performance, and regulatory transaction fees were substantially lower on reduced rates. We have gotten better and better at reducing these costs for our clients. As a percent of commission, execution and clearing costs declined from 36% in the third quarter of 2019 to 27% in the third quarter of '20 and now to 20% in the third quarter of this year. With client trading volumes rising, while we continuously improve our order routing technology, more commission revenue goes to the bottom line. Our ratio of compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenues was 15%, unchanged from last year despite a 28% increase in headcount. This reflects our expense discipline and our strong top line. Our quarter end headcount was 2,471. G&A expenses were up 19% on the prior year, reflecting legal expenses on litigation and prior period bank fees, neither of which we would expect to continue at this pace. Our adjusted pretax margin was a robust 65%. By practicing expense control while also hiring and investing in the business for accelerated growth, we are maintaining the operating leverage in our business. Finally, on the income taxes line of this $28 million shown, the operating company's portion with $19 million the public company's portion was $9 million. Moving to our balance sheet on Page 5 of the release, the total assets ended the quarter at $106 billion with growth driven by margin lending to customers. Our consolidated equity capital reached $10 billion for the first time, and we have no long-term debt. We continue to deploy our balance sheet to support our growing client business, in particular, more and larger customers want access to margin lending, which our capital base gives us the ability to provide. We opened offices in Ireland and Hungary in response to Brexit. For those and our other rapidly growing international locations, our capital base provides the foundation needed for today's operations and for future growth. Our capital is also used for numerous other growth and investment opportunities we see worldwide. And finally, an ample capital base helps us win business, by showing the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners. Let's look briefly at our operating data on Pages 6 and 7 of the release. Page 6 shows contract and share volumes for all customers rose 34% in options and 100% in stocks, well above industry growth. Activity is strong across client types and geographies. In most securities products, our volumes are still above the very high activity levels of 2020. Turning to Page 7, account growth remains robust with 555,000 account adds for the year and 122,000 for the latest quarter on top of record performance in the first half of this year. Total accounts reached 1.5 million, 57% over the prior year and 9% over the prior quarter. Customer equity growth reflected strength in new accounts, solid additions to existing accounts and a generally supportive market environment. Total customer DARTs reached their third highest quarterly level ever at 2.3 million trades per day. This reflected investor confidence in rising markets, the ongoing global search for yield in zero and negative interest rate environments and more customers on our trading platform. Commission for a cleared commissionable order shows our success in capturing rebates paid by exchanges. We route IBKR Pro orders directly to exchanges realizing these exchange rebates and passing the savings on to our clients by lowering their commission. Our cleared IBKR Pro customers paid an average of $2.46 per order, 9% less than we did last year, as our order adding system found opportunities to maximize rebates while achieving best price execution. Our clients benefit with lower commission costs as we pass our lower execution and clearing costs on to them. Profitability per order to us remains the same. Next, we break down our net interest margin on Page 8 of the release. Total GAAP net interest income was $274 million, significantly higher than a year ago, reflecting increases in margin lending and securities lending. Average margin loan balances and margin interest income were up 64% and 70%, respectively, from last year. Investors were comfortable this quarter taking on leverage in a fairly benign market environment. Securities lending net interest was up 43% from last year, driven by strong client participation in the market. As we grow our client and our customer base, our opportunities to lend customers shares to other customers who short these stocks also grows. Together with increasing our profitable securities lending to other broker dealers, the model generates expanding revenues. We believe our proprietary system developed in-house for securities lending and operated by our team of specialists is proficient in identifying and lending out securities and high demand, which drives our revenue from this activity. Moving to net interest from segregated cash and from customer credit balances, this shows the impact of negative benchmark rates in certain countries. When benchmark rates are very low, as they are in the U.S., we pay no interest to customers on their cash. But in currencies where rates are negative, we earn interest by passing through these negative rates to customers. We earned $8 million on this. When benchmark rates are positive, we earn interest on depositing and investing our segregated cash balance. But because of negative rates in some currencies, we had a net cost of $4 million on these balances. Taken together, the net interest income from these balances was $4 million for the quarter. Now our estimate of the impact of the next 25 basis point increase in the U.S. benchmark rates, we expect the next 25 basis point rise in rates to produce an additional $107 million annually. This does not take into account any change in how we may adjust our strategy to take advantage of newly higher rates. About 24% of our customer cash balances are not in U.S. dollars, so estimates of the impact of U.S. rate changes exclude those currencies. In conclusion, this was a strong quarter that reflects our ability to grow our customer base and that shows the attractiveness of our strategy to automate for growth, expanding what we offer while minimizing what we charge. Given our progress and performance, we're confident in our ability to grow accounts Thomas has indicated, maintain our expense discipline, and to capture future opportunities as they arise. And with that, we'll now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nRich Repetto: Good evening, Thomas and Paul and Nancy. Just a follow-up question on the China situation. I know the accounts have been drawn down at Futu and Tiger. I guess Thomas, can you explain just about other operations, from what I understand your servers aren't in China. But are there any other impacts on client growth? Again, it's clear what's going on with Futu and Tiger. But just that region, is that going to have any other follow-on impacts.\nThomas Peterffy: Well, I'm glad that it's so clear to you. It may not be so clear to everybody else. So, but any day -- so while IBKR does not process client data in China to the extend we keep data on customers who reside in China, we must keep that data on their procedures that satisfy, you know the criteria that they have public. This criteria we find is very similar to the one imposed by the European Union under the so-called GDPR rules. Since we have built those procedures at the time the GDPR rules came into effect, we will modify and reuse them for Chinese customers. Now, these are direct customers from mainland China. As you know, we have the two introducing brokers, Futu and Tiger Brokers you mentioned, these two firms will have to work with the regulator to make sure that they are compliant with the new rules. While we do not think that these accounts are, that the accounts -- their accounts with us, I mean in a danger of having to close, it is well known that Futu has been planning to go on their own in the U.S. We think, if anything, the new rules may slow down that process. But anyway, the investors who want to know our exposure to these two brokers, our expected net revenue, no gross revenue, sorry, our expected gross revenue derived from servicing Futu and Tiger, by the end of the year we expect it to be $75 million. Most of these accounts operate on an omnibus basis, but they still have about 64,000 individual accounts, which we have indications that they will convert to omnibus, and so in that case it will result in a 64,000 account diminution in our number of customer accounts. So, that's what I have to say about that.\nRich Repetto: It was a little bit more complicated than what I thought. But that's helpful, Thomas.\nThomas Peterffy: Thank you.\nRich Repetto: Okay. Another question, just trying to understand a little bit about the crypto offering, I know it's the pricing of it is, you know in Interactive Brokers style highly, highly competitive. And I guess what you're seeing early on, because your customers don't go for -- you know haven't gone a lot for the zero commission. So, I'm just trying to see whether that's any -- whether they are real crypto traders as well?\nThomas Peterffy: All right. So, we have invited so far, as you know, we cannot make this available everywhere, right at the start, because we haven't verbed out the licensing situation. So, at this moment, this is only available in the United States. We have so far invited, I think around 350,000 accounts, of which 17,000 requested permission to trade it, and that's what we have so far. Now as of yesterday, we have enabled registered investment advisors, because we often heard that people whose accounts are managed by registered investment advisors would like to have some crypto, and so that creates a situation where we are the only broker at this time, where an investment manager can trade crypto along with stocks and bonds for her clients and manage all positions on one screen, and shows them in one account.\nRich Repetto: Got it. Very helpful. Last question is, the meme stock report or Gamestop SEC report came out yesterday. I just was wondering whether you had any big takeaways from the information that was provided or the conclusions that they reached, anyway -- I didn't quite see all the connections, but maybe you did, Thomas.\nThomas Peterffy: I was extremely surprised to find that they did not mention the pre-opening activity on those two days when their stock doubled or tripled, because pre-opening trading usually is on a very, very strong run-up is usually indicating that the broker has to cover fails, because the broker on the first day has to cover the fails prior to the open, no matter what the price. So, I think that's what must have driven price in those two days prior to being open.\nRich Repetto: Got it. Thank you, Tom. I'll get back in the queue since I already asked three questions. But, anyway, thanks, Thomas.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Nance with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nWill Nance: Thomas, maybe I could start on some of the comments in the prepared remarks around growth. If I think back a couple of years ago, I think you talked about 20% growth. Now, we're talking about 30% growth and it's on a larger account side. So I think, it seems like you guys have gotten more confident in the growth outlook and I'm just curious if there's anything particularly you'd point to or what you're kind of seeing in the market that you think is helping the brand resonate a little bit more with customers?\nThomas Peterffy: Yes. So number one, we are experiencing that stronger growth. And number two, we have a clear plan of how to go forward nurturing the growth. So, I'm very confident about -- being about 30% going forward for indefinitely.\nWill Nance: That's helpful. Maybe just a ticky-tack one for Paul on the expenses. I think you mentioned there were some elevated legal expenses, and I think a handful of other things in G&A this quarter. Any sense of the magnitude there?\nPaul Brody: So, it's probably relatively safe to say that the run rate that we had been running previously is a bit more realistic to return to. To put it maybe an overall number on it, that's probably $3 million to $4 million extra in the quarter, something like that.\nWill Nance: Got it. That's helpful. Appreciate it. And then just lastly, I was wondering if you can maybe address some of the news flow in the quarter around the BSA, AML issues? I realize there may not be much you can say, but just curious if there's any light you can shed on that?\nThomas Peterffy: What do you exactly mean?\nWill Nance: I think around the article as I had, I think around you guys and Morgan Stanley around some [indiscernible] investigation?\nThomas Peterffy: Oh, yes, yes. Well, I tell you honestly, that was the first time I heard of that customer, and you are right, I haven't even moved into the situation. I mean, I'm sure our compliance people are handling it. But I would think that if it were a serious issue, they would have brought to my attention by now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. I wanted to follow-up just on the account growth, and you've obviously very positive across all regions channels. Can you talk about the profile of the new customers coming on board, how that compares to your existing kind of customer? Is there anything specific or regions, I know that you said broadly very strong everywhere, but any specific areas to call out where you're having outsized success?\nThomas Peterffy: No, it's just great across the Board. It's similar growth every year.\nDan Fannon: And the profile of the customer is similar or?\nThomas Peterffy: Yes, it is similar. Yes. I mean, look, I mean, let's say is at the very beginning, when we started Interactive Brokers, we were of course going after the people, the traders, the floor traders that had to lead the floor. So if you look back to our early years, we had very few customers at very high rates of trading. So that is gradually coming down as we go forward. So every year, basically the number of trades per account is slowly dropping, but we still have around about 400 trades a year or something like that per account.\nDan Fannon: Okay. And then just you mentioned an increased yield on your advertising dollars, which is something that I think you said or alluded to allow you to spend more. Can you talk about that in terms of, obviously that I assume that ties to the account growth, but how we should think about that in terms of spending? And are there certain channels or regions that you think your -- that advertising dollars going further?\nThomas Peterffy: Yes, because our advertising dollars are certainly tied to certain aspects of our platform, and when we introduce something new, we do that now with a lot of advertising. So when we introduce crypto, we had a crypto advertising campaign that is going to continue for quite some time. Now, very, very shortly on November 1, we are introducing the new capability that we are going to start with a huge ad campaign. So -- and this part of reason why I feel so confident about the account growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.\nKyle Voigt: Hey, good evening. If I could just follow-up actually on the question, Dan's question on advertising. Thomas, I know there, you just mentioned new product rollouts and maybe that's different, but I know historically there has been some frustration about not getting that adequate return on marketing investment and clearly that's changed. I'm just wondering if you could speak to -- like has there been a strategy shift in terms like where, which channels those marketing dollars are being spent in or [indiscernible]?\nThomas Peterffy: Yes, but this is a very sensitive competitive issue, because you know, everybody is trying to advertise and gain more accounts. So yes, we have gotten into it very deeply and we now understand better, where you get your money's worth and where you do not.\nKyle Voigt: Got it. And so, as we're looking out to 2022 and beyond, do you think that's going to be kind of over the medium term, not just near term, but over the medium term, do you think advertising is going to be a bigger part of that medium term kind of growth story to continuously drive the account growth. Is that what you're saying?\nThomas Peterffy: I certainly, hope so. I do not have definite proof that for our plans, but we have the plans and we are going to go forward with them, and I think that we have every indication that they are going to work.\nKyle Voigt: Got it. Fair enough. Thank you. And then I guess another question, in terms of the Paxos relationship, just wondering can you help us better understand the contract structure? Is there just a set revenue share on the trading revenue that's generated, and so that's shared with Paxos?\nThomas Peterffy: So we are the customer to Paxos, the customers earlier to Paxos, and Paxos charge the commission and then gives us a share of it, not a share of it, it gives us a fee.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. Thanks. And then just my last one is, just in terms of -- if I look at the individual account size, if I'm doing my math correctly from the prepared remarks, it looks like the average account size is getting smaller despite the increase in the equity markets. So I think you commented earlier that the average client that's being acquired looks relatively similar, but is it fair to say that they're generally smaller-sized accounts? Is that fair to say, Thomas?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, introducing broker accounts are smaller, and yes, individual accounts are on the average, smaller. Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open.\nChris Allen: Good evening, everyone. Just wanted to follow up on a couple of things. One, Thomas on the crypto launch, I think you said you're going to broad the number of coins. Any color just in terms of where do you think you may get to on that? What's the timing around that?\nThomas Peterffy: I think, well, you know it's not up to us. It's up to Paxos, and I understand that they are working on adding five more coins in the near future.\nChris Allen: Understood. And then, I just want to follow up on Rich's question on your spot in some future targets, I just want to make sure I understood it correctly. You expect the gross revenues from those IB relationships to get to $75 million at year-end. Do you expect it to be maintained, even if they continue to migrate some of the U.S. customers to sub-clearing, or is that going to decline over time? Just want to be clear on that.\nThomas Peterffy: So no, the $75 million is just simple, I looked at the year-to-date growth and I expanded it to the end of the year. So that, I mean, I'm not expecting it to go up or down. I guess if I have to quantify, so that it's easily understandable, right, $75 million a year is understandable, right. Now some of our -- I mean everybody has known, and we have been talking about that for some time that Futu wants to become separate in the United States, and they put up a company and they've applied. I think they've applied for registration, FINRA and OCC, etcetera. So we are expecting them to eventually leave us. And so as I think this new rule, if anything may slow that down a little bit. Otherwise, as I mentioned, yes, we have 64,000 individual accounts still that come from -- mostly from Tiger, and I think that those accounts will go into an omnibus account and as a result, we'll lose those accounts, as our number of accounts. So our number of accounts would seemingly shrink. But simultaneously, the average account size will increase.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Macrae Sykes with Gabelli. Your line is open.\nMacrae Sykes: Just going back to this cryptocurrency, I think if Interactive is being a pretty competitive platform, and obviously this is a huge business for Coinbase and some of the other competitors, but it sounds like given how you're rolling out things, you're viewing it more as a complementary product to your accounts? I mean is this something that you could think could be a significant growth driver in the future, once you get settled on the operations, your relationship, etcetera? Or should we always kind of think of this as not being a major focus for you?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, no, I wouldn't think that, because I believe that there are 10s of millions of investors in the United States and I will think of crypto as just one product among the many they invest in, right. So I think it's a pain in the neck for them to have -- to have a different account when they want to buy some crypto versus when they want to buy a stock or sell an option or by a future, right. I mean it's so much nicer for -- for a person like that to have all the assets on -- in one account and see it on one screen and trade it from one screen, right. That's had -- that's what has always been our competitive strengths, right, enabling people to trade product all over the world from one screen in any currency and from one account, right.\nMacrae Sykes: Okay. I appreciate that. And I just wanted to -- just switching subjects a little bit. I wanted to get your thoughts on gamification and obviously providing education to clients to get them to understand the markets better, but I wanted to get your views on sort of where are the gray areas between some of these gimmicks and some of these other platforms are doing in terms of increase engagement, but perhaps crossing the rules or sort of good ethics around engaging the customer.\nThomas Peterffy: So as I have indicated previously, we are focusing on providing more education to our clients, and so we will reveal certain graphics that may be helpful in that effort, and I myself do not know about gamification, because to tell you frankly, I've never been on another brokers' platform. And I also never played any computer games. So I don't know the similarities. I'm the wrong man to ask about that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nRich Repetto: Yes, I just want to follow up one question with Paul, and you mentioned that 24% of your cash balances are non-U.S. And I assume that's 24% of the $23 billion of segregated cash. And could you also tell us, is there a way to quantify customers that don't have the 100,000 to fully get any increase in rates if short-term rates went up, to quantify that other part, we don't pay interest to your clients, the incremental interest.\nPaul Brody: Right. So a couple of things. I can give you a minor correction, that 24% is of customer credits. Not a segregated cash, that cash is a little bit different because in certain areas under SEC rules, we have to bring foreign currencies back into U.S. dollars, in order to protect them for the customers. That's about 26%. It makes the foreign currency about 26%. So, to your -- I'm sorry your second question was about the interest rate changes on where we're currently paying no interest on credit. It boils down to what is our spread. So in U.S. dollars, are advertised right there on our website. The spread is the benchmark minus 50 basis points. So, when Fed funds goes over 50 basis points, we will start paying interest again and similarly in other currencies. And I think you asked about on negative rate currencies, or maybe I'll just give you a little more information that our negative rate currencies as those rates go up something similar will happen, except that we do pass-through on the majority of balances, we now pass through negative rate to at least the larger customers, customers with less than $50,000 equivalent in those negative rate currencies, kind of get a free pass, they get zero interest, because we want to treat them well and keep those customers around, and it doesn't cost us a lot.\nThomas Peterffy: And to respond to the $100,000 question. So if you remember, say interest rates go to 1% that we are going to pay half a percent to accounts with a $100,000 and above and gradually less as the amount of funds in the account -- the amount of the value of the account decreases. So for example, if somebody has an account worth $50,000, he's going to get 25% on the cash part of his asset in the account.\nRich Repetto: Understood. Got it. Last question is, Thomas, we've had a quarter now since I last asked you about this, but any views or thoughts on regulation regards to payment for order flow coming after reading either the report or any interactions you might have had during the quarter, but your thoughts on whether there will actually be any regulatory changes to payment forward?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, I think that Gensler very, very much like to do something, and he said to us as much, that he would really love to do something and he is looking for ways to do it. I don't know if he will find one because there is going to be wish back about, whether the people that -- price or not. So, and he's very smart when he comes out with this information flow, because, indeed I mean that is hard to put a dollar figure on, but while the internalizers get the information flow, I'm not sure we've being damaged by them having the information flow. It's certainly not the person that send the order, but the person with the next order, right. And that person may be through a different broker, through a different high frequency trader, right.\nRich Repetto: Yes. Okay. That's helpful. Just wanted to hear your latest thoughts on it. Thank you.\nThomas Peterffy: All right.\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Nancy Stuebe.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you, everyone for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on our site tomorrow. Thanks again, and we will talk to you next quarter end.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nancy Stuebe",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 earnings call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. He will handle the Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the Company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature are not certain and are outside of the Company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. In the third quarter, we once again reached a record number of accounts, 1,536,000. Our year-over-year account growth of 57% was nearly equal in all three of our geographic regions. The markets continued to be constructive for us, but more normalized than they were last year driving commissions to $311 million, the second highest we have ever reported only exceeded by this year's hyperactive first quarter. While our GAAP reported net revenues were $464 million, our adjusted net revenues of $650 million were also our second highest on record, again surpassed only by the first quarter. The $186 million adjustment to net revenues was virtually all due to the depreciation of Tiger Brokers' stock price. We invested in Tiger at a blended price of less than $3 a share in 2018 and 2019 to help them gather enough capital to enter into the brokerage business on the large scale they wanted using our platform as an introducing broker. Since that time, the stock has traded as high as $38 and as low as $3, and at quarter end, our gain on this investment was about $80 million. Even though this started out as a relatively minor investment, it certainly has provided a lot of unintended distraction to our investors who look at our financials. With the new focus on the part of the Chinese government on data security, we now expect the stock to keep swinging for a while until they come to a clear understanding with the regulator of what is required and how to get there. Our financial performance underscores the strength of our platform and of our focus on automating as much of the brokerage business as possible. This gives us the ability to maximize our product and service offering while minimizing our costs. Automation to us means that our 1.5 million customers from all over the world can interact and trade securities, commodities and currencies with each other across 141 trading venues in many jurisdictions under different rules, seemingly from one account. This is not easy. And it is the reason that not all products on our platform are available for all users, such as crypto, which is not yet available to many of our non-U.S. customers, but we are working hard on that. We just yesterday enabled registered investment advisors to add small crypto positions to the investment portfolios of clients who requested it, which we are told happens ever more often. Automation also enables us to generate upon request, a single, nicely compiled investment report that not only summarizes your holdings and returns and the risk you have been taking but does so across continents and products and currencies. And you can even custom tailor it for yourself or for your customers, column by column. We've even added the capability to include assets that are custodied elsewhere and incorporate them into this report no matter what country or major currency they are in. We continue to see active trading among our client base. To give a sense of this, in the third quarter of 2019, our equity volume was 41 billion shares. In the third quarter of 2020, it was 86 billion shares. This quarter, it reached 172 billion shares. Third quarter total DARTs of 2.3 million were the third highest in company history, following the first two quarters of this year, as existing clients continue their activity and new clients begin to participate. Client investing confidence can also be seen in our customer margin loans, which reached a record $50.2 billion, up 67% from last year. We continue to see our clients putting their available funds to work. $50 billion of margin loans represents about 6% of all outstanding industry margin loans, even though we only hold less than a fraction of 1% of all investable assets. This is also remarkable because our margin lending policies are comparatively conservative, and we automatically liquidate positions and accounts that come into violation of these policies. The reason for our high margin balance is that we only charge 0.75% to 1.56% to IBKR Pro customers for margin loans. This policy is a major draw for sophisticated traders to trade often and use leverage. The more our clients participate, the stronger we become. Our reported pretax profit margin was 50% and adjusted for non-core items was 65%. We know of no other broker who can claim profit margins close to this. Our new account growth remains quite positive ahead of both prior year and prior quarter adds. Investor confidence and activity are strong across the globe in all regions as we emerge from the pandemic. This activity continues to be led more by individual investors who tend to stay with us, especially internationally, because we offer a broad product range in the lowest cost to those investors, and there are many who wish to invest globally. This breadth is one of our strategic advantages, one that is extremely difficult to offer. For any broker providing market access can be expensive and complex. To do so globally with compliance, legal, currency, and tax and reporting requirements that vary by market is even more so. Having all this automated is our competitive advantage. Three quarters of our accounts are international in rapidly growing markets. Even as we come through this period of COVID, global interest in the markets that began early last year continues. People have grown comfortable doing more and more of their financial business electronically. They have grown more connected to financial markets, institutions and each other online, which in turn drives even more people to participate. This, along with our continuing dedication to add more products and services to our platform is why we believe year-over-year growth of total accounts can be at least 30% going forward indefinitely. Once again, all client segments and geographies showed strong account adds with all regions showing greater than 55% year-on-year account growth. Now, I will go over our five client segments. Individual customers who made up 64% of our accounts, 37% of our client equity, and 54% of our commissions continued their remarkable run of growth with 12-month account growth of 79%, client equity growth of 57%, and commissions of 35%. All geographic regions we serve saw growth in individual accounts of over 70% with European accounts topping all regions with over 90% growth. This underscores what we always say, it is important to provide a reliable platform that is global because people around the world want to maximize their opportunities to invest in the variety of ways they prefer. Hedge fund customers also continued to grow. For the 12 months ended September 30, we saw 4% hedge fund account growth, 41% customer equity growth, and 4% commission growth. We continued to add growing and larger hedge funds, which can be seen in the particularly robust growth in client equity in this segment. Hedge funds represent 1% of our accounts, 7% of our client equity, and 6% of our commissions. According to Preqin, we moved from eighth to seventh place as the prime broker servicing the most single manager hedge funds. We are in first place as the prime broker servicing the most hedge funds with under $50 million in AUM. And for the second year in a row, we are the fastest-growing prime broker. Proprietary trading firms are 2% of our accounts, 9% of our client equity and 12% of commissions. For the quarter, this group grew by 36% in accounts for the 12-month period, 44% in client equity and 19% in commissions. All regions saw strong growth. We are seeing particular success in this segment in Europe as more prop trading firms open and new and existing firms move to us due to our unusually diverse international product base, to capitalize on our reputation for seamless, efficient and favorable trade executions and as investors seek to counterbalance negative interest rates in the EU. Financial advisors are 9% of our accounts, 17% of our customer equity and 10% of our commissions. This group grew accounts by 19% for the 12-month period, customer equity by 41% and commissions by 7%. Account and client equity growth in this segment tends to be higher than commission growth as advisors typically tend to trade more conservatively. More larger advisor firms are beginning to try Interactive Brokers for our adaptable account structures where you can manage hedge funds, SMAs and regular client accounts under one master and invest across the world in a wide variety of products that now includes crypto. And RIA can use a rich set of tools and capabilities and with our dedicated client service desk for advisors, we continue to get better and capture more business globally. Our final segment is introducing brokers. These represent 25% of our accounts, 30% of our client equity and 17% of our commissions. IBroker segment account growth was 31% for the latest 12 months, with client equity up 59% and commissions up 97%. Offering the ticket of global access to their customers is critical for brokers looking to grow their business. Worldwide, new brokers starting up and existing brokers looking to extend the breadth and depth of their offerings turn to our platform for its global trading and seamless back-office functionality. With the worldwide growth in investors who want global access, introducing brokers know that their best opportunity to succeed is to partner with us to provide it. Much was done to enhance and improve our platform this quarter. We eliminated monthly inactivity fees, part of our ongoing commitment to provide low-cost training solutions. We introduced Bitcoin early last month in response to client demand. Over the next few months, we will be broadening both the regions and types of customers and coins available on our platform. We are very proud of the great advances we have made in building out our compliance systems and staff, in a group that now numbers 350 across the many regional brokerage subsidiaries we have around the world, each with its own unique rules and regulations. We've increased the yield on our advertising dollars, to a point at which it is becoming profitable to spend more. We have grown our sales force, and they are gaining stride. As Interactive Brokers becomes better known for the sophistication and diverse capabilities of our platform, along with our industry low pricing, it is easier and easier for them to attract new and larger customers. The growing controversy and focus on payment for order flow is to our advantage. Due to our unique position in the PFOF space, where we provide either zero commissions or executions at a small commission crossing at usually better prices in our ATS, we have a great opportunity to attract more institutional flow. They love to trade against our often overseen retail flow in between the NBBO, where both sides benefit. All in all, it is a thrill for us to keep building new things and adding more and more products and capabilities and to offer it to an ever-growing audience at the same time. It feels like our opportunities are, for the moment, unlimited, but we must hurry because the empty unserved product space is filling in quickly. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul? Thank you, everyone for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on our site tomorrow. Thanks again, and we will talk to you next quarter end."

            "name": "Paul Brody",
            "content": "Thank you, Nancy. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call. I'll review the third quarter results, and then we'll open it up for questions. Please first note, we have reordered our earnings release a bit to more closely align with many readers' expectations. So I'll start with our revenue items on Page 3 of the release. Commissions continue to be strong, returning our second highest ever quarterly revenues of $311 million. This reflects higher trading volumes, especially in stocks and options from active customers and a groundswell of new customers on our platform. Net interest income generated $274 million in revenues. Margin lending was particularly strong this quarter, with customers producing $141 million in margin interest, reflecting their confidence in the market. Securities lending also continued its strong run as investor demand for a broad range of securities to borrow was met with a growing supply of inventory held by our customers. We generated $49 million in revenues from other fees and services, even while discontinuing account in activity fees. Strong client activity drove revenues higher in market data fees and risk exposure fees, and income from options exchanged liquidity payments was driven higher by options volume. Market data fees were $20 million, up 21%. Risk exposure fees more than doubled to $8 million, and exchange liquidity payments were $10 million, up 51%. We eliminated account inactivity fees on July 1 to further improve account retention. We believe the trade-off will be worth it for the long-term growth of the business. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Many of these are excluded in our adjusted earnings. Outside of those, other income was up to $16 million. Turning to expenses. Execution, clearing and distribution costs were down 18% despite the higher trading volume, capturing exchange liquidity rebates through our state-of-the-art order routing system drove this performance, and regulatory transaction fees were substantially lower on reduced rates. We have gotten better and better at reducing these costs for our clients. As a percent of commission, execution and clearing costs declined from 36% in the third quarter of 2019 to 27% in the third quarter of '20 and now to 20% in the third quarter of this year. With client trading volumes rising, while we continuously improve our order routing technology, more commission revenue goes to the bottom line. Our ratio of compensation and benefits expense to adjusted net revenues was 15%, unchanged from last year despite a 28% increase in headcount. This reflects our expense discipline and our strong top line. Our quarter end headcount was 2,471. G&A expenses were up 19% on the prior year, reflecting legal expenses on litigation and prior period bank fees, neither of which we would expect to continue at this pace. Our adjusted pretax margin was a robust 65%. By practicing expense control while also hiring and investing in the business for accelerated growth, we are maintaining the operating leverage in our business. Finally, on the income taxes line of this $28 million shown, the operating company's portion with $19 million the public company's portion was $9 million. Moving to our balance sheet on Page 5 of the release, the total assets ended the quarter at $106 billion with growth driven by margin lending to customers. Our consolidated equity capital reached $10 billion for the first time, and we have no long-term debt. We continue to deploy our balance sheet to support our growing client business, in particular, more and larger customers want access to margin lending, which our capital base gives us the ability to provide. We opened offices in Ireland and Hungary in response to Brexit. For those and our other rapidly growing international locations, our capital base provides the foundation needed for today's operations and for future growth. Our capital is also used for numerous other growth and investment opportunities we see worldwide. And finally, an ample capital base helps us win business, by showing the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners. Let's look briefly at our operating data on Pages 6 and 7 of the release. Page 6 shows contract and share volumes for all customers rose 34% in options and 100% in stocks, well above industry growth. Activity is strong across client types and geographies. In most securities products, our volumes are still above the very high activity levels of 2020. Turning to Page 7, account growth remains robust with 555,000 account adds for the year and 122,000 for the latest quarter on top of record performance in the first half of this year. Total accounts reached 1.5 million, 57% over the prior year and 9% over the prior quarter. Customer equity growth reflected strength in new accounts, solid additions to existing accounts and a generally supportive market environment. Total customer DARTs reached their third highest quarterly level ever at 2.3 million trades per day. This reflected investor confidence in rising markets, the ongoing global search for yield in zero and negative interest rate environments and more customers on our trading platform. Commission for a cleared commissionable order shows our success in capturing rebates paid by exchanges. We route IBKR Pro orders directly to exchanges realizing these exchange rebates and passing the savings on to our clients by lowering their commission. Our cleared IBKR Pro customers paid an average of $2.46 per order, 9% less than we did last year, as our order adding system found opportunities to maximize rebates while achieving best price execution. Our clients benefit with lower commission costs as we pass our lower execution and clearing costs on to them. Profitability per order to us remains the same. Next, we break down our net interest margin on Page 8 of the release. Total GAAP net interest income was $274 million, significantly higher than a year ago, reflecting increases in margin lending and securities lending. Average margin loan balances and margin interest income were up 64% and 70%, respectively, from last year. Investors were comfortable this quarter taking on leverage in a fairly benign market environment. Securities lending net interest was up 43% from last year, driven by strong client participation in the market. As we grow our client and our customer base, our opportunities to lend customers shares to other customers who short these stocks also grows. Together with increasing our profitable securities lending to other broker dealers, the model generates expanding revenues. We believe our proprietary system developed in-house for securities lending and operated by our team of specialists is proficient in identifying and lending out securities and high demand, which drives our revenue from this activity. Moving to net interest from segregated cash and from customer credit balances, this shows the impact of negative benchmark rates in certain countries. When benchmark rates are very low, as they are in the U.S., we pay no interest to customers on their cash. But in currencies where rates are negative, we earn interest by passing through these negative rates to customers. We earned $8 million on this. When benchmark rates are positive, we earn interest on depositing and investing our segregated cash balance. But because of negative rates in some currencies, we had a net cost of $4 million on these balances. Taken together, the net interest income from these balances was $4 million for the quarter. Now our estimate of the impact of the next 25 basis point increase in the U.S. benchmark rates, we expect the next 25 basis point rise in rates to produce an additional $107 million annually. This does not take into account any change in how we may adjust our strategy to take advantage of newly higher rates. About 24% of our customer cash balances are not in U.S. dollars, so estimates of the impact of U.S. rate changes exclude those currencies. In conclusion, this was a strong quarter that reflects our ability to grow our customer base and that shows the attractiveness of our strategy to automate for growth, expanding what we offer while minimizing what we charge. Given our progress and performance, we're confident in our ability to grow accounts Thomas has indicated, maintain our expense discipline, and to capture future opportunities as they arise. And with that, we'll now open up the line for questions. So, it's probably relatively safe to say that the run rate that we had been running previously is a bit more realistic to return to. To put it maybe an overall number on it, that's probably $3 million to $4 million extra in the quarter, something like that. Right. So a couple of things. I can give you a minor correction, that 24% is of customer credits. Not a segregated cash, that cash is a little bit different because in certain areas under SEC rules, we have to bring foreign currencies back into U.S. dollars, in order to protect them for the customers. That's about 26%. It makes the foreign currency about 26%. So, to your -- I'm sorry your second question was about the interest rate changes on where we're currently paying no interest on credit. It boils down to what is our spread. So in U.S. dollars, are advertised right there on our website. The spread is the benchmark minus 50 basis points. So, when Fed funds goes over 50 basis points, we will start paying interest again and similarly in other currencies. And I think you asked about on negative rate currencies, or maybe I'll just give you a little more information that our negative rate currencies as those rates go up something similar will happen, except that we do pass-through on the majority of balances, we now pass through negative rate to at least the larger customers, customers with less than $50,000 equivalent in those negative rate currencies, kind of get a free pass, they get zero interest, because we want to treat them well and keep those customers around, and it doesn't cost us a lot."

            "name": "Thomas Peterffy",
            "content": "Well, I'm glad that it's so clear to you. It may not be so clear to everybody else. So, but any day -- so while IBKR does not process client data in China to the extend we keep data on customers who reside in China, we must keep that data on their procedures that satisfy, you know the criteria that they have public. This criteria we find is very similar to the one imposed by the European Union under the so-called GDPR rules. Since we have built those procedures at the time the GDPR rules came into effect, we will modify and reuse them for Chinese customers. Now, these are direct customers from mainland China. As you know, we have the two introducing brokers, Futu and Tiger Brokers you mentioned, these two firms will have to work with the regulator to make sure that they are compliant with the new rules. While we do not think that these accounts are, that the accounts -- their accounts with us, I mean in a danger of having to close, it is well known that Futu has been planning to go on their own in the U.S. We think, if anything, the new rules may slow down that process. But anyway, the investors who want to know our exposure to these two brokers, our expected net revenue, no gross revenue, sorry, our expected gross revenue derived from servicing Futu and Tiger, by the end of the year we expect it to be $75 million. Most of these accounts operate on an omnibus basis, but they still have about 64,000 individual accounts, which we have indications that they will convert to omnibus, and so in that case it will result in a 64,000 account diminution in our number of customer accounts. So, that's what I have to say about that. Thank you. All right. So, we have invited so far, as you know, we cannot make this available everywhere, right at the start, because we haven't verbed out the licensing situation. So, at this moment, this is only available in the United States. We have so far invited, I think around 350,000 accounts, of which 17,000 requested permission to trade it, and that's what we have so far. Now as of yesterday, we have enabled registered investment advisors, because we often heard that people whose accounts are managed by registered investment advisors would like to have some crypto, and so that creates a situation where we are the only broker at this time, where an investment manager can trade crypto along with stocks and bonds for her clients and manage all positions on one screen, and shows them in one account. I was extremely surprised to find that they did not mention the pre-opening activity on those two days when their stock doubled or tripled, because pre-opening trading usually is on a very, very strong run-up is usually indicating that the broker has to cover fails, because the broker on the first day has to cover the fails prior to the open, no matter what the price. So, I think that's what must have driven price in those two days prior to being open. Yes. So number one, we are experiencing that stronger growth. And number two, we have a clear plan of how to go forward nurturing the growth. So, I'm very confident about -- being about 30% going forward for indefinitely. What do you exactly mean? Oh, yes, yes. Well, I tell you honestly, that was the first time I heard of that customer, and you are right, I haven't even moved into the situation. I mean, I'm sure our compliance people are handling it. But I would think that if it were a serious issue, they would have brought to my attention by now. No, it's just great across the Board. It's similar growth every year. Yes, it is similar. Yes. I mean, look, I mean, let's say is at the very beginning, when we started Interactive Brokers, we were of course going after the people, the traders, the floor traders that had to lead the floor. So if you look back to our early years, we had very few customers at very high rates of trading. So that is gradually coming down as we go forward. So every year, basically the number of trades per account is slowly dropping, but we still have around about 400 trades a year or something like that per account. Yes, because our advertising dollars are certainly tied to certain aspects of our platform, and when we introduce something new, we do that now with a lot of advertising. So when we introduce crypto, we had a crypto advertising campaign that is going to continue for quite some time. Now, very, very shortly on November 1, we are introducing the new capability that we are going to start with a huge ad campaign. So -- and this part of reason why I feel so confident about the account growth. Yes, but this is a very sensitive competitive issue, because you know, everybody is trying to advertise and gain more accounts. So yes, we have gotten into it very deeply and we now understand better, where you get your money's worth and where you do not. I certainly, hope so. I do not have definite proof that for our plans, but we have the plans and we are going to go forward with them, and I think that we have every indication that they are going to work. So we are the customer to Paxos, the customers earlier to Paxos, and Paxos charge the commission and then gives us a share of it, not a share of it, it gives us a fee. Well, introducing broker accounts are smaller, and yes, individual accounts are on the average, smaller. Yes. I think, well, you know it's not up to us. It's up to Paxos, and I understand that they are working on adding five more coins in the near future. So no, the $75 million is just simple, I looked at the year-to-date growth and I expanded it to the end of the year. So that, I mean, I'm not expecting it to go up or down. I guess if I have to quantify, so that it's easily understandable, right, $75 million a year is understandable, right. Now some of our -- I mean everybody has known, and we have been talking about that for some time that Futu wants to become separate in the United States, and they put up a company and they've applied. I think they've applied for registration, FINRA and OCC, etcetera. So we are expecting them to eventually leave us. And so as I think this new rule, if anything may slow that down a little bit. Otherwise, as I mentioned, yes, we have 64,000 individual accounts still that come from -- mostly from Tiger, and I think that those accounts will go into an omnibus account and as a result, we'll lose those accounts, as our number of accounts. So our number of accounts would seemingly shrink. But simultaneously, the average account size will increase. Well, no, I wouldn't think that, because I believe that there are 10s of millions of investors in the United States and I will think of crypto as just one product among the many they invest in, right. So I think it's a pain in the neck for them to have -- to have a different account when they want to buy some crypto versus when they want to buy a stock or sell an option or by a future, right. I mean it's so much nicer for -- for a person like that to have all the assets on -- in one account and see it on one screen and trade it from one screen, right. That's had -- that's what has always been our competitive strengths, right, enabling people to trade product all over the world from one screen in any currency and from one account, right. So as I have indicated previously, we are focusing on providing more education to our clients, and so we will reveal certain graphics that may be helpful in that effort, and I myself do not know about gamification, because to tell you frankly, I've never been on another brokers' platform. And I also never played any computer games. So I don't know the similarities. I'm the wrong man to ask about that. And to respond to the $100,000 question. So if you remember, say interest rates go to 1% that we are going to pay half a percent to accounts with a $100,000 and above and gradually less as the amount of funds in the account -- the amount of the value of the account decreases. So for example, if somebody has an account worth $50,000, he's going to get 25% on the cash part of his asset in the account. Well, I think that Gensler very, very much like to do something, and he said to us as much, that he would really love to do something and he is looking for ways to do it. I don't know if he will find one because there is going to be wish back about, whether the people that -- price or not. So, and he's very smart when he comes out with this information flow, because, indeed I mean that is hard to put a dollar figure on, but while the internalizers get the information flow, I'm not sure we've being damaged by them having the information flow. It's certainly not the person that send the order, but the person with the next order, right. And that person may be through a different broker, through a different high frequency trader, right. All right."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Interactive Brokers Group Second Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Nancy Stuebe, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNancy Stuebe: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. He will handle the Q&A. As a reminder, today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company\u2019s belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company\u2019s control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. Q2 was a fantastic quarter. With the exception of the first quarter this year, it was the best one in Interactive Brokers\u2019 history. Total accounts grew 61% versus a year ago, a record, say for the first quarter. Client equity grew 79%, growth also outpaced only by Q1. Total client DARTs of $2.3 million were also, except for Q1, a record. The same is true of our stock share and options contract volumes. Our business strength can also be seen in our overall metrics. While our client equity or the cash and securities in client accounts grew 79%, client margin loans rose even faster to a record high of $49 billion, up 96%. In contrast, client credit balances or the cash and client accounts grew 16%. Why? Strong markets and an active client base let our customers utilize the Interactive Brokers\u2019 platform to put proportionately more of their money to work in the market. As a percent of our client equity, margin loans have risen from a pandemic outset low of 11.5%, up to 13.4% as investors have grown more confident and want to participate in the market. This increase is even more impressive when you consider that while for margin loans, the numerator is based solely on client activity, the denominator of client equity is based on customer activity plus overall market performance. Even if there was no change in total margin loans, rising markets mean that this ratio will naturally decline. Instead, we see that this ratio increased nearly 200 basis points within a backdrop of rising global markets, showing investor confidence and willingness to participate. And the more our clients participate, the stronger we become. Our reported pre-tax margin was 72% and adjusted for non-core items was 67%. We know of no other broker who can claim margins close to this. We see this investor confidence and strong activity across the globe in all geographies. As we observed earlier this year, this activity appears to be led more by individual investors than by institutions. These customers tend to be sticky as they become familiar with our platform; and especially internationally, we offer the broadest geographic product offering and lowest cost to those investors and there are many who wish to invest internationally. It is expensive to provide global market access with compliance, legal, currency, and tax and reporting requirements different in each market and the costs to comply with all these requirements is high. As three quarters of our accounts are international, this competitive advantage continues to serve us well. Over time, even as this period of COVID winds down, we see global interest in the markets and the rise of the electronic connectedness of individuals to financial markets, institutions, and each other driving more people to participate, generating further interest in the financial markets among investors old and new. We continue to see year-over-year growth in total accounts in the high 20s to low 30%. This is well above the high-teens level year-over-year growth we experienced before the pandemic. We continue to get better at giving our customers the power to navigate through our numerous high-quality features more efficiently. We continue to improve on giving them a customized work environment. We continue to listen to them to learn what products and tools they want added. And now to go over our record, for the first quarter numbers. We ended the quarter with a record 1,414,000 accounts, a net increase of 61%. Once again, we saw account growth in all client segments in all geographic regions with all areas showing over 50% growth, with modestly more rapid growth in Asia. We saw growth in all five of the client types that we service. I will now go over our five client segments. Individual customers who made up 63% of our accounts, 37% of our client equity, and 54% of our commissions continued their growth this quarter with 12-month account growth of 88% and client equity growth of 85%, while commissions grew 48%. In addition to the aforementioned factors, continued active interest in markets by investors worldwide increases market indices and investor desire to improve on zero interest rate environment alternative are some of the reasons behind this segment\u2019s strength. All geographic areas we serve saw triple-digit individual account growth with close to uniform growth rates across the Americas, Europe, and Asia. This proves the importance of providing a reliable platform to a global audience, offering wide product choices and worldwide access and shows that clients want the maximum opportunities to invest in the variety of ways they prefer. We continue to see growth in the Hedge Fund customer segment. For the 12 months ended June 30, we saw a 2% Hedge Fund account growth, 54% customer equity growth, and 5% commission growth. We continue to benefit from a reputation for best price execution, low and transparent margin and securities financing rates, the quality of our platform, and the strength of our balance sheet. Hedge Funds represent 1% of our accounts, 7% of our client equity, and 6% of our commission. Proprietary trading firms are 2% of our accounts, 9% of our client equity, and 12% of commission. For the quarter, this group grew by 34% in accounts for the 12-month period, 48% in client equity, and 21% in commission. Prop trading firms are sensitive to the direction of volatility and trade more as volatility increases. While not as high as the spike in the first quarter, continuing strong volatility led to more active trading strategies, while accounts and client equity grew due to more traders wanting to be on our platform to capitalize on its reputation for seamlessness and efficient trade execution. Financial advisers are 10% of our account, 16% of our customer equity, and 10% of our commissions. This group grew accounts by 20% for the 12-month period, customer equity by 52%, and commissions by 6%. Account and client equity growth show our increasing penetration of this segment. Commissions were up by less than the account and equity growth as advisers typically tend to trade more conservatively. While our independent advisor business is small relative to Fidelity or Schwab, those firms serve the advisor and individual segments only. Interactive Brokers also caters to Hedge Funds and prop traders, more demanding groups as far as certain functionality is concerned. We add tools and build out our infrastructure based on input from each client segment and then make these improvements available to all of them. As a result, our platform has the richest set of tools and capabilities. And with this strategy, we get better and grow faster in each of our customer segments than our peers. Our final segment is introducing brokers. These represent 26% of our accounts, 32% of our client equity and 17% of our commissions. iBroker segment account growth was 39% for the latest 12 months, while client equity more than doubled, growing 115% and commissions by 131%. Interactive Brokers\u2019 platform provides the global trading and seamless back office functionality critical for brokers who want to provide a global offering in order to capture clients worldwide who seek to invest and want to be able to access many markets in order to do so. We continue to be excited about 2021 and beyond. I know you were all going to ask me about a Bitcoin introduction and we expect it by the end of next month. In other areas, we have provided content to Coursera, creating a certificate program for them called a Practical Guide to Trading, which covers equities, ForEx, U.S. bond and derivatives trading. You should also take a look at IBKR campus, which offers over 50 courses on investment products, trading tools and portfolio and risk analysis. We want informed clients who will have the knowledge and tools to be with us for the long run. And finally, we look forward to the Robinhood IPO so that our various metrics can be compared to another firm besides Charles Schwab. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul?\nPaul Brody: Thank you, Nancy. Thanks everyone for joining the call. As usual, we will review the quarterly operating results, the non-core items, factors that drove those numbers, and then we will open it up for questions. Starting with the operating data, progressively stronger trading levels and record margin borrowing throughout the quarter drove robust operating metrics, albeit below the unusual spike in the first quarter, with the tailwind of rising world markets on positive vaccination and economic news and low interest rates. Continued global interest in financial markets, amid the search for higher yield, led to industry trading volumes that are still above the activity level of 2020 in most products. Mean stock trading volume came down from the extreme highs of the first quarter, which impacted industry volumes, mainly on stock. So, over the course of the second quarter, trading by our active trader customer base rose from April lows. Volatility, as measured by the average VIX, fell from the unusually high levels it reached early last year at the beginning of the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic, a time of great uncertainty amid rising case numbers worldwide. The average VIX fell from 35 in the second quarter last year to 18 this quarter. And while it has come down recently, the VIX is still stronger than pre-pandemic levels, reflecting perhaps the unevenness of the reopening of economies worldwide. Compared to the second quarter of 2020, our quarterly total DARTs rose 32% to $2.3 million, second only to the unusually active first quarter. Our customer trade volumes rose year-on-year in several product classes, led by increases of 34% and 160% in options and stock volumes respectively. Stock volume was inflated by trading in low-priced stocks though even after removing those from our calculation, our share volume still rose 36%. Again, these volumes are second only to those of the first quarter. Futures volume declined 19% year-on-year, but remained modestly higher than the pre-pandemic level. FX dollar volumes this quarter were lower, a trend we have seen since the explosion of volume in early 2020 and now are about even with pre-pandemic levels. Total accounts reached a record $1.414 million, up 61% over the prior year, contributing to customer equity, growing 79% from the second quarter of 2020 to $363.5 billion. Our overall average commission per cleared commissionable order declined 15% versus last year to $2.38. So, it rose 3% versus the first quarter. Factors impacting this decline included product mix that featured smaller average trade sizes in options and ForEx and our continued success in capturing liquidity rebates, some or all of which are passed through to our clients. Capturing these rebates reduces the overall commission our clients pay, decreasing the average commission per DART, but also reduces the exchange fees we pay on the expense side, making their net impact neutral to our bottom line. Moving to our net interest margin table, our net interest margin rose from 0.99% to 1.15% year-over-year, driven by margin lending and securities lending. Quarter-over-quarter, our NIM declined from 1.26% to 1.15%, partially impacted by a decrease in the average effective U.S. benchmark Fed funds rate from 8 to 7 basis points with a further impact from most other rates worldwide remaining at or below zero. Securities lending and margin loans were the largest contributors to our net interest income. Securities lending was particularly strong this quarter, though down from a spike in the first quarter when several stocks presented us opportunities to lend at high rate. Utilizing our in-house developed system, our team executed on opportunities to lend hard-to-borrow names that investors were looking to short. Net interest income from securities lending reached $136 million this quarter, up 70% year-over-year. Average margin loan balances rose 94% versus last year as investors continue to grow more comfortable taking on risk and leverage. Higher year-over-year balances led to a 97% increase in margin loan interest income to $128 million. In light of the flat yield curve, we kept the duration of our portfolio relatively short and recorded an immaterial mark-to-market loss on our holdings of U.S. Treasury. Outside the U.S., notably in Europe, where we have grown accounts at 55% and client equity by 70%, negative benchmark interest rates in some currencies have affected our ability to achieve acceptable yields on our segregated cash in this region. This has led to a couple of unusual factors. Over the past few quarters, we have earned interest on our customer credit balances as we pass through negative rate costs on large balances in these currencies. Our aggregate yield on segregated cash in this quarter was immaterial, but slightly negative. This was driven by increased customer cash balances and negative rate currencies although offset by the pass-through of costs I just mentioned. Aggregate segregated cash balances fell 13% as clients used more cash to invest in the financial markets and more cash was used to fund margin lending in the U.S. This overall decline along with inflows in negative rate currencies led to a drop in our segregated cash net interest to minus $2 million, including the pass-through of $8 million of the negative rate interest to customers. The net interest earned on segregated cash balances was $6 million for the quarter. Note that for accounting purposes, our FDIC sweep program, which was $2.7 billion in the second quarter, removes funds that would otherwise be included in segregated cash balances on our balance sheet. Now for our estimate of the impact of the next 25 basis point increase in rates, and calculating the impact of rate changes, we understand that as the possibility of a future rate increase becomes more certain this expectation is typically already reflected in the yields of the instruments in which we invest. Therefore, we attempt to isolate the impact of an unexpected rise in falling rate separate from the impact of rate hikes or cuts that have already been baked into the prices of these instruments. With that assumption, we would expect the next 25 basis point unanticipated rise in rates to produce an additional $99 million in net interest income over the next four quarters and $102 million as the yearly run rate based on our current balance sheet. Our net interest income is highly sensitive to small rate increases due to the impact of low benchmark rates on the spread between what we earn on our segregated cash and what we pay to our customers. As U.S. rates fell below 50 basis points, our spread compressed as we earn less on our segregated cash. However, the converse is also true that as rates move back up towards 50 basis points, the spread rise. The $102 million run rate includes the reinvestment of all of our present holdings at the new assumed rate, but does not take into account any change in how we may manage our segregated cash. A 25 basis point unanticipated fall in rates would produce a decline in net interest income of $32 million over the next four quarters and $32 million as well for the yearly run rate. As a reminder, about quarter of our customer credit balances are not in U.S. dollars, and so changes in rates that occur in the U.S. do not apply to all of our balance. Turning to the income statement. We define non-core items as those not part of our fundamental operating results. Non-core adjusting items versus the year ago quarter are as follows: our currency diversification strategy swung from a gain of $16 million a year ago to a loss of $9 million this quarter for a comparative decrease in income of $25 million. Investment gains and losses rose from a gain of $13 million to a gain of $113 million this quarter for a comparative increase of $100 million. And mark-to-market on U.S. government securities went from a $13 million loss to about zero this quarter, a comparative increase of $13 million. The net effect of these items increased pre-tax income by $104 million this quarter, a positive shift of $88 million over last year\u2019s quarter. Net revenues were \u2013 they reported $754 million for the quarter, up 40% versus last year\u2019s second quarter. Excluding non-core items, net revenues were up 24% to $650 million. Commission revenue rose 11% on higher volumes year-on-year, particularly in stocks and options. Net interest income rose 40% to $274 million despite continued low benchmark interest rates, thanks to growth in our balance sheet, higher margin loan balances and our successful securities lending efforts, our growth in net interest was robust. Other fees and services revenues, which include market data, exposure, account activity, FDIC bank sweep program and IPO facilitation fees as well as order flow income from options exchange mandated programs rose 38% to $55 million. The top three contributors were risk exposure fees, which were up $6 million, market data fees, which were up $5 million, and liquidity payments from options exchanges, which rose $2 million. Other income, which includes gains and losses on our investments and currency diversification strategy, as well as principal transaction showed a gain of $118 million, up from a gain of $27 million in last year\u2019s quarter. Ex non-core items, other income increased 27% to $14 million. Non-interest expenses were $213 million for the quarter, down 33% from last year\u2019s quarter. Larger exchange liquidity rebate, lower futures volume and a $6 million clearing fee rebate drove a 29% reduction in execution clearing and distribution fees to $54 million despite the higher stock and options volume. As mentioned, a portion of exchange liquidity rebates are passed through to our clients and are reflected in reduced commission. Fixed expenses were $158 million, down 34%, driven by a 73% decrease in G&A expense. Last year\u2019s G&A included a $103 million in costs associated with the WTI oil futures event. At quarter end, our total head count stood at 2,429, a 34% increase over last year. We continue to hire aggressively in client services to support the influx of new accounts as well as in software development. Note, too, that Brexit requires that we open offices in Europe, which are now fully operational in Hungary as well as in Ireland. Customer bad debt expense was $1 million, well contained for a highly active trading period. Reported pre-tax income more than doubled from last year\u2019s quarter to $541 million or a 72% pre-tax margin. And excluding non-core items, pre-tax income rose 41% to $437 million, 67% pre-tax margin. Diluted earnings per share were $1 for the quarter versus $0.40 for the same period in 2020. And ex non-core items, diluted earnings per share were $0.82 versus $0.57 as adjusted last year. Now to help investors better understand our earnings, taxes and the split between public shareholders and the non-controlling interest, the second quarter numbers are as follows. Starting with our pre-tax income of $541 million, we removed $1 million income at the holding company, then we deduct $12 million for income taxes paid by our operating companies, which are mostly foreign tax. This leaves $528 million, of which 78.1% or that $414 million reported on our income statement is attributable to non-controlling interests. The remaining 21.9% or $114 million is available for the public company shareholders. As this is a non-GAAP measure, it is not reported on our income statement. After we expense remaining taxes owed by the public company of $23 million on that $114 million, the net income available for common stockholders is the $92 million you see reported on our income statement. Note that the public company\u2019s tax is proportionately higher than last year, primarily because IBG Inc\u2019s. ownership rose from 18.6% to 21.9%. Our total income tax expense of $35 million consists of this $23 million plus the $12 million of taxes paid by the operating company. Turning to the balance sheet, with $9.9 billion in consolidated equity at June 30, 2021, we\u2019re well capitalized from a regulatory standpoint. We deploy our strong capital base toward opportunities to grow our business and investment opportunities worldwide as well as to emphasize the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners. Our capital is deployed across 14 registered broker-dealer type entities around the world, supporting regulatory capital requirements, liquidity needs, margin lending, and other financing opportunities in our growing brokerage business. And we continue to carry no long-term debt. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the moderator, and we will take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nRich Repetto: Yes. Good evening, Thomas. Good evening, Paul. I guess my first question is on interest and interest sensitivity. And I know, Paul, you gave us the sensitivity to the 25 basis points move, but I was just trying to see if \u2013 when and if the Fed gets to 50 basis points or above, I know you share that completely with customers, but you don\u2019t share it if they have less than $100,000 or pro rata and they need $10,000 in cash. Is there any way we can get to \u2013 I think you\u2019ve given in the past about how much cash is, what we call, rate insensitive that would fall \u2013 that wouldn\u2019t be \u2013 get \u2013 share that interest above the Fed rate of 50 basis points? And then the other part would be just what could you do on treasuries in your reinvestment sort of policy? How could the NIM expand if potentially treasuries were to widen out?\nPaul Brody: I can take the first one certainly. Yes, our fully interest rate-sensitive credit amount to about 14% of the total credit, about $11.2 billion at the end of the quarter. So that can give you an idea of the portion on which we can fully capture any other rate increases. And to the second, I would turn that one over to Thomas with regard to investment policy on \u2013 depending on the yield curve, I guess, is really your question, yes?\nThomas Peterffy: So we\u2019re going to remain invested for the short-term, because I wouldn\u2019t dare to go out very far on the yield curve, especially with these rising inflation prospects. But as to your first question, that first half percent is just completely ours, right, you understand it. So when [indiscernible] rates go to 0.5%, that is completely ours. From thereon, we share. But our clients with less than $100,000, they have only about sum total of $10 billion.\nRich Repetto: Understood. Yes. And the \u2013 if we got \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to understand, if we looked at pass rate, last rate cycle, your net interest \u2013 your NIM expanded dramatically. And if \u2013 I\u2019m not saying today, but if yield curve changed dramatically in a rising rate scenario, wouldn\u2019t we expect some NIM expansion because you would go farther out the curve on treasuries rather than staying short rate \u2013 on the short end right now?\nThomas Peterffy: It\u2019s not because we are not further out, I mean we went out maybe a year. But it\u2019s mostly because the first half percent is \u2013 it\u2019s a huge amount of money on $85 billion of free cash we\u2019re sitting on, customer cash.\nRich Repetto: Got it. Okay. My last question would be, Thomas, you\u2019ve talked about regulatory issues. Any \u2013 have your views on payment for order flow or what \u2013 any changes to market structure that you could \u2013 that you are at least bracing for or think could possibly change over the next 12 months to 18 months?\nThomas Peterffy: So, I cannot foresee any change because basically this has been the business of Wall Street for 200 years now, namely customer order comes in and the firm trades against it, right. Now all that is happening with Schwab and Robinhood [indiscernible] on the other is that they are two different companies. But \u2013 so if they prohibited order flow, what would happen is Schwab will buy Virtu, and Citadel will buy Robinhood, right. And the same thing would just continue, right. So, I don\u2019t think that the annual \u2013 the payment for order flow can be prohibited. It just unbundles the traditional Wall Street model.\nRich Repetto: Got it. Super helpful Thomas. Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. So, just a follow-up on some of the account metrics and the growth numbers that you guys cited in regions, continues to be very strong, I believe last quarter you talked about China and Hong Kong being slightly weaker. But \u2013 so just curious if there\u2019s anything underneath at a country level or other areas where things are potentially not as strong as otherwise would be expected.\nThomas Peterffy: China continues to be weaker, even weaker than it was in the previous quarter. And I mean it went out to practically nothing. And Hong Kong is just \u2013 it is certainly not as strong as it was a year ago, but it sort of continues. Otherwise, there is Europe, especially Eastern Europe, the Middle East, South America, these are especially strong.\nDan Fannon: In the profile of the customer being added today, any kind of material difference or change than what you have seen historically?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, in the mix, maybe there are some smaller customers, but we also get larger customers in there due to our institutional efforts such as the prop trading firms and the investment advisors. So overall, there isn\u2019t a substantial difference in the mix and the size of customers.\nDan Fannon: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is now open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good evening. So Thomas, if you look at May and June metrics, specifically, I think you were running around 23% or 24% annualized account growth rate. In the past, you had said you thought that account growth would kind of normalize towards the \u2013 kind of maybe high 20% or around 30% range, but seems like the trajectory of the growth over the past couple of months is trending below that. So I guess, any updated thoughts on where you think that account growth will stabilize as this kind of work-from-home environment ends and the operating environment normalizes?\nThomas Peterffy: My best guess is 30%. I am aware that May was lower, June was also lower, not \u2013 although not 23%, but I think more like 27%. But my best guess going forward is 30%.\nKyle Voigt: Okay. Second question is on the elimination of the monthly inactivity fees. I think we probably asked about this for a long time, a lot of the analyst community. Just wondering, can you help us understand why you thought now was the right time to eliminate these fees. Do you think that could impact your account growth rate? And does this move kind of suggests a shift in strategy in terms of wanting to target maybe smaller, less active individual traders, which is a little bit different than where you have historically targeted?\nThomas Peterffy: So, it is not paying the traders, new traders, it\u2019s aimed at existing folks that decide to hang up their hats for a while and not trade and so what they have been doing is they close their accounts and then \u2013 in order to save the inactivity fee. And so they come back a year or 2 years later, but they won\u2019t necessarily come back to us. They go to some other broker. So, that\u2019s what we want to prevent. So, we want to \u2013 we would like to hold on to the people who have had accounts with us. We want them to continue to have a concept of even if they become inactive for a while. And so that their account is open, even if they just leave a few dollars and then when they are ready to invest again, they will do it with us.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. And then just maybe my final questions on securities lending. Just down from a record first quarter, but still grew 70% year-on-year and the revenues there. I guess when we are thinking about the current sec lending environment, would you still think of this as an elevated revenue level or I guess I am asking if this is \u2013 should be a good run rate going forward because, as I said, 70% year-on-year growth in revenues, but your average client equity was also up over 70% year-over-year and account growth was also up very strongly, but just curious on your thoughts on the current kind of environment for sec lending.\nThomas Peterffy: I didn\u2019t understand the first word, security funding you said?\nKyle Voigt: Securities lending.\nThomas Peterffy: Lending. Okay.\nKyle Voigt: Sorry.\nPaul Brody: If I can comment, Thomas. Sure. Sure. I mean as we always say, it\u2019s driven by both as the customer base grows and balances grow, it is driven by higher short balances and greater inventory to lend, but it is most particularly driven by stocks that get hot in the marketplace. And for some period of time, sometimes very short, sometimes an extended period of time, we can lend them out at very high rate. And so we had some experience with that this past quarter, we had more in the first quarter. These stocks just come and go as you can read about them in the news. We are just able to take advantage of them, both because our customers borrow money against them, but also because we have a fully paid lending program, we call it Stock Yield Enhancement Program. And so, we have seen growth there, and it provides us opportunities to increase revenues because we are now lending out more of our customers\u2019 stock in that program.\nThomas Peterffy: I would add to that, that our especially low margin rates brings in a lot of clients who want to carry positions on margin. And as you know, those positions are available to us to lend. So, there is a benefit to charging a very low margin rate.\nKyle Voigt: Great. Thanks and thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Allen from Compass Point. Your line is now open.\nChris Allen: Thank you everyone. Maybe just a follow-up on Kyle\u2019s question on the monthly activity fees, any estimate in terms of how many accounts have been closed to save on the activity fees maybe over the last year or 2 years?\nThomas Peterffy: I would guess about 25,000 accounts a year, but that\u2019s a guess.\nChris Allen: Got it. And then I think it was yesterday you announced a new pricing over in Europe, standard pricing, I guess, as started in Western Europe. Maybe just some color just in terms of \u2013 what was the catalyst to introduce new pricing scheme? Any estimate in terms of financial impact?\nThomas Peterffy: So, there is no financial impact to speak of. But our competitors were advertising these similar simple rates, our issue was that our rates are not so simple. And the \u2013 so we now can say that it\u2019s \u20ac3 or some \u00a33 whatever your currency is. And so it competes well with other folks in the marketplace.\nChris Allen: Understood. Thanks and that\u2019s it for me.\nOperator: And thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, I would now like to turn the call back to Nancy Stuebe, Director of Investor Relations, for closing remarks. I apologize. We have a follow-up question from Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler.\nRich Repetto: Thank you. Yes, want to get one more in, Thomas, a quick one, I think. Paul, could you define fully paid security lending versus just, I guess, margin loan lending? And then also, do you think that just because we are trading in the U.S. markets, almost 50% higher levels at 10 billion shares a day versus 7 billion in 2019. Does that make it more likely that stocks are \u2013 that you have these scarce stocks just because there is more trading overall? Like in other words, more evidence that the elevated securities lending could be \u2013 could stay elevated going forward?\nPaul Brody: Well, certainly, the greater inventory we have, the more likely it is that we have more shares in the high rate stocks to lend. And this feeds on itself, as Thomas said, as our low rates attract more margin lending that frees up those \u2013 that body of stocks for us to lend. On that, we earn 100% of the revenue because they are margin stock. And on the fully paid stocks, we share that revenue generally 50-50 with our customer. Fully paid mean, it\u2019s either fully paid even in a cash account or in a margin account where there may be margin borrowing by the customer, that\u2019s not the full amount of margin borrowing that the customer can put on, which leads some of the stocks to be not collateralizing margin loans, and therefore, they are fully paid, and we can still lend them out. And in fact, the customer will earn something on those shares.\nThomas Peterffy: So, we have an outright agreement with some of our customers in which we agree, they agree that we can lend out their shares that are fully paid for, and we agreed to hold them on as far as the credit risk. So, we guarantee them against credit risk and we keep them have the proceeds.\nRich Repetto: Understood. Thank you. Very helpful. That\u2019s all I have.\nOperator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back to Nancy Stuebe, Director of Investor Relations, for closing remarks.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you everyone for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will look forward to talking to you next quarter end.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. He will handle the Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. Q2 was a fantastic quarter. With the exception of the first quarter this year, it was the best one in Interactive Brokers' history. Total accounts grew 61% versus a year ago, a record, say for the first quarter. Client equity grew 79%, growth also outpaced only by Q1. Total client DARTs of $2.3 million were also, except for Q1, a record. The same is true of our stock share and options contract volumes. Our business strength can also be seen in our overall metrics. While our client equity or the cash and securities in client accounts grew 79%, client margin loans rose even faster to a record high of $49 billion, up 96%. In contrast, client credit balances or the cash and client accounts grew 16%. Why? Strong markets and an active client base let our customers utilize the Interactive Brokers' platform to put proportionately more of their money to work in the market. As a percent of our client equity, margin loans have risen from a pandemic outset low of 11.5%, up to 13.4% as investors have grown more confident and want to participate in the market. This increase is even more impressive when you consider that while for margin loans, the numerator is based solely on client activity, the denominator of client equity is based on customer activity plus overall market performance. Even if there was no change in total margin loans, rising markets mean that this ratio will naturally decline. Instead, we see that this ratio increased nearly 200 basis points within a backdrop of rising global markets, showing investor confidence and willingness to participate. And the more our clients participate, the stronger we become. Our reported pre-tax margin was 72% and adjusted for non-core items was 67%. We know of no other broker who can claim margins close to this. We see this investor confidence and strong activity across the globe in all geographies. As we observed earlier this year, this activity appears to be led more by individual investors than by institutions. These customers tend to be sticky as they become familiar with our platform; and especially internationally, we offer the broadest geographic product offering and lowest cost to those investors and there are many who wish to invest internationally. It is expensive to provide global market access with compliance, legal, currency, and tax and reporting requirements different in each market and the costs to comply with all these requirements is high. As three quarters of our accounts are international, this competitive advantage continues to serve us well. Over time, even as this period of COVID winds down, we see global interest in the markets and the rise of the electronic connectedness of individuals to financial markets, institutions, and each other driving more people to participate, generating further interest in the financial markets among investors old and new. We continue to see year-over-year growth in total accounts in the high 20s to low 30%. This is well above the high-teens level year-over-year growth we experienced before the pandemic. We continue to get better at giving our customers the power to navigate through our numerous high-quality features more efficiently. We continue to improve on giving them a customized work environment. We continue to listen to them to learn what products and tools they want added. And now to go over our record, for the first quarter numbers. We ended the quarter with a record 1,414,000 accounts, a net increase of 61%. Once again, we saw account growth in all client segments in all geographic regions with all areas showing over 50% growth, with modestly more rapid growth in Asia. We saw growth in all five of the client types that we service. I will now go over our five client segments. Individual customers who made up 63% of our accounts, 37% of our client equity, and 54% of our commissions continued their growth this quarter with 12-month account growth of 88% and client equity growth of 85%, while commissions grew 48%. In addition to the aforementioned factors, continued active interest in markets by investors worldwide increases market indices and investor desire to improve on zero interest rate environment alternative are some of the reasons behind this segment's strength. All geographic areas we serve saw triple-digit individual account growth with close to uniform growth rates across the Americas, Europe, and Asia. This proves the importance of providing a reliable platform to a global audience, offering wide product choices and worldwide access and shows that clients want the maximum opportunities to invest in the variety of ways they prefer. We continue to see growth in the Hedge Fund customer segment. For the 12 months ended June 30, we saw a 2% Hedge Fund account growth, 54% customer equity growth, and 5% commission growth. We continue to benefit from a reputation for best price execution, low and transparent margin and securities financing rates, the quality of our platform, and the strength of our balance sheet. Hedge Funds represent 1% of our accounts, 7% of our client equity, and 6% of our commission. Proprietary trading firms are 2% of our accounts, 9% of our client equity, and 12% of commission. For the quarter, this group grew by 34% in accounts for the 12-month period, 48% in client equity, and 21% in commission. Prop trading firms are sensitive to the direction of volatility and trade more as volatility increases. While not as high as the spike in the first quarter, continuing strong volatility led to more active trading strategies, while accounts and client equity grew due to more traders wanting to be on our platform to capitalize on its reputation for seamlessness and efficient trade execution. Financial advisers are 10% of our account, 16% of our customer equity, and 10% of our commissions. This group grew accounts by 20% for the 12-month period, customer equity by 52%, and commissions by 6%. Account and client equity growth show our increasing penetration of this segment. Commissions were up by less than the account and equity growth as advisers typically tend to trade more conservatively. While our independent advisor business is small relative to Fidelity or Schwab, those firms serve the advisor and individual segments only. Interactive Brokers also caters to Hedge Funds and prop traders, more demanding groups as far as certain functionality is concerned. We add tools and build out our infrastructure based on input from each client segment and then make these improvements available to all of them. As a result, our platform has the richest set of tools and capabilities. And with this strategy, we get better and grow faster in each of our customer segments than our peers. Our final segment is introducing brokers. These represent 26% of our accounts, 32% of our client equity and 17% of our commissions. iBroker segment account growth was 39% for the latest 12 months, while client equity more than doubled, growing 115% and commissions by 131%. Interactive Brokers' platform provides the global trading and seamless back office functionality critical for brokers who want to provide a global offering in order to capture clients worldwide who seek to invest and want to be able to access many markets in order to do so. We continue to be excited about 2021 and beyond. I know you were all going to ask me about a Bitcoin introduction and we expect it by the end of next month. In other areas, we have provided content to Coursera, creating a certificate program for them called a Practical Guide to Trading, which covers equities, ForEx, U.S. bond and derivatives trading. You should also take a look at IBKR campus, which offers over 50 courses on investment products, trading tools and portfolio and risk analysis. We want informed clients who will have the knowledge and tools to be with us for the long run. And finally, we look forward to the Robinhood IPO so that our various metrics can be compared to another firm besides Charles Schwab. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul? Thank you everyone for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will look forward to talking to you next quarter end."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Paul Brody",
            "content": "Thank you, Nancy. Thanks everyone for joining the call. As usual, we will review the quarterly operating results, the non-core items, factors that drove those numbers, and then we will open it up for questions. Starting with the operating data, progressively stronger trading levels and record margin borrowing throughout the quarter drove robust operating metrics, albeit below the unusual spike in the first quarter, with the tailwind of rising world markets on positive vaccination and economic news and low interest rates. Continued global interest in financial markets, amid the search for higher yield, led to industry trading volumes that are still above the activity level of 2020 in most products. Mean stock trading volume came down from the extreme highs of the first quarter, which impacted industry volumes, mainly on stock. So, over the course of the second quarter, trading by our active trader customer base rose from April lows. Volatility, as measured by the average VIX, fell from the unusually high levels it reached early last year at the beginning of the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic, a time of great uncertainty amid rising case numbers worldwide. The average VIX fell from 35 in the second quarter last year to 18 this quarter. And while it has come down recently, the VIX is still stronger than pre-pandemic levels, reflecting perhaps the unevenness of the reopening of economies worldwide. Compared to the second quarter of 2020, our quarterly total DARTs rose 32% to $2.3 million, second only to the unusually active first quarter. Our customer trade volumes rose year-on-year in several product classes, led by increases of 34% and 160% in options and stock volumes respectively. Stock volume was inflated by trading in low-priced stocks though even after removing those from our calculation, our share volume still rose 36%. Again, these volumes are second only to those of the first quarter. Futures volume declined 19% year-on-year, but remained modestly higher than the pre-pandemic level. FX dollar volumes this quarter were lower, a trend we have seen since the explosion of volume in early 2020 and now are about even with pre-pandemic levels. Total accounts reached a record $1.414 million, up 61% over the prior year, contributing to customer equity, growing 79% from the second quarter of 2020 to $363.5 billion. Our overall average commission per cleared commissionable order declined 15% versus last year to $2.38. So, it rose 3% versus the first quarter. Factors impacting this decline included product mix that featured smaller average trade sizes in options and ForEx and our continued success in capturing liquidity rebates, some or all of which are passed through to our clients. Capturing these rebates reduces the overall commission our clients pay, decreasing the average commission per DART, but also reduces the exchange fees we pay on the expense side, making their net impact neutral to our bottom line. Moving to our net interest margin table, our net interest margin rose from 0.99% to 1.15% year-over-year, driven by margin lending and securities lending. Quarter-over-quarter, our NIM declined from 1.26% to 1.15%, partially impacted by a decrease in the average effective U.S. benchmark Fed funds rate from 8 to 7 basis points with a further impact from most other rates worldwide remaining at or below zero. Securities lending and margin loans were the largest contributors to our net interest income. Securities lending was particularly strong this quarter, though down from a spike in the first quarter when several stocks presented us opportunities to lend at high rate. Utilizing our in-house developed system, our team executed on opportunities to lend hard-to-borrow names that investors were looking to short. Net interest income from securities lending reached $136 million this quarter, up 70% year-over-year. Average margin loan balances rose 94% versus last year as investors continue to grow more comfortable taking on risk and leverage. Higher year-over-year balances led to a 97% increase in margin loan interest income to $128 million. In light of the flat yield curve, we kept the duration of our portfolio relatively short and recorded an immaterial mark-to-market loss on our holdings of U.S. Treasury. Outside the U.S., notably in Europe, where we have grown accounts at 55% and client equity by 70%, negative benchmark interest rates in some currencies have affected our ability to achieve acceptable yields on our segregated cash in this region. This has led to a couple of unusual factors. Over the past few quarters, we have earned interest on our customer credit balances as we pass through negative rate costs on large balances in these currencies. Our aggregate yield on segregated cash in this quarter was immaterial, but slightly negative. This was driven by increased customer cash balances and negative rate currencies although offset by the pass-through of costs I just mentioned. Aggregate segregated cash balances fell 13% as clients used more cash to invest in the financial markets and more cash was used to fund margin lending in the U.S. This overall decline along with inflows in negative rate currencies led to a drop in our segregated cash net interest to minus $2 million, including the pass-through of $8 million of the negative rate interest to customers. The net interest earned on segregated cash balances was $6 million for the quarter. Note that for accounting purposes, our FDIC sweep program, which was $2.7 billion in the second quarter, removes funds that would otherwise be included in segregated cash balances on our balance sheet. Now for our estimate of the impact of the next 25 basis point increase in rates, and calculating the impact of rate changes, we understand that as the possibility of a future rate increase becomes more certain this expectation is typically already reflected in the yields of the instruments in which we invest. Therefore, we attempt to isolate the impact of an unexpected rise in falling rate separate from the impact of rate hikes or cuts that have already been baked into the prices of these instruments. With that assumption, we would expect the next 25 basis point unanticipated rise in rates to produce an additional $99 million in net interest income over the next four quarters and $102 million as the yearly run rate based on our current balance sheet. Our net interest income is highly sensitive to small rate increases due to the impact of low benchmark rates on the spread between what we earn on our segregated cash and what we pay to our customers. As U.S. rates fell below 50 basis points, our spread compressed as we earn less on our segregated cash. However, the converse is also true that as rates move back up towards 50 basis points, the spread rise. The $102 million run rate includes the reinvestment of all of our present holdings at the new assumed rate, but does not take into account any change in how we may manage our segregated cash. A 25 basis point unanticipated fall in rates would produce a decline in net interest income of $32 million over the next four quarters and $32 million as well for the yearly run rate. As a reminder, about quarter of our customer credit balances are not in U.S. dollars, and so changes in rates that occur in the U.S. do not apply to all of our balance. Turning to the income statement. We define non-core items as those not part of our fundamental operating results. Non-core adjusting items versus the year ago quarter are as follows: our currency diversification strategy swung from a gain of $16 million a year ago to a loss of $9 million this quarter for a comparative decrease in income of $25 million. Investment gains and losses rose from a gain of $13 million to a gain of $113 million this quarter for a comparative increase of $100 million. And mark-to-market on U.S. government securities went from a $13 million loss to about zero this quarter, a comparative increase of $13 million. The net effect of these items increased pre-tax income by $104 million this quarter, a positive shift of $88 million over last year's quarter. Net revenues were \u2013 they reported $754 million for the quarter, up 40% versus last year's second quarter. Excluding non-core items, net revenues were up 24% to $650 million. Commission revenue rose 11% on higher volumes year-on-year, particularly in stocks and options. Net interest income rose 40% to $274 million despite continued low benchmark interest rates, thanks to growth in our balance sheet, higher margin loan balances and our successful securities lending efforts, our growth in net interest was robust. Other fees and services revenues, which include market data, exposure, account activity, FDIC bank sweep program and IPO facilitation fees as well as order flow income from options exchange mandated programs rose 38% to $55 million. The top three contributors were risk exposure fees, which were up $6 million, market data fees, which were up $5 million, and liquidity payments from options exchanges, which rose $2 million. Other income, which includes gains and losses on our investments and currency diversification strategy, as well as principal transaction showed a gain of $118 million, up from a gain of $27 million in last year's quarter. Ex non-core items, other income increased 27% to $14 million. Non-interest expenses were $213 million for the quarter, down 33% from last year's quarter. Larger exchange liquidity rebate, lower futures volume and a $6 million clearing fee rebate drove a 29% reduction in execution clearing and distribution fees to $54 million despite the higher stock and options volume. As mentioned, a portion of exchange liquidity rebates are passed through to our clients and are reflected in reduced commission. Fixed expenses were $158 million, down 34%, driven by a 73% decrease in G&A expense. Last year's G&A included a $103 million in costs associated with the WTI oil futures event. At quarter end, our total head count stood at 2,429, a 34% increase over last year. We continue to hire aggressively in client services to support the influx of new accounts as well as in software development. Note, too, that Brexit requires that we open offices in Europe, which are now fully operational in Hungary as well as in Ireland. Customer bad debt expense was $1 million, well contained for a highly active trading period. Reported pre-tax income more than doubled from last year's quarter to $541 million or a 72% pre-tax margin. And excluding non-core items, pre-tax income rose 41% to $437 million, 67% pre-tax margin. Diluted earnings per share were $1 for the quarter versus $0.40 for the same period in 2020. And ex non-core items, diluted earnings per share were $0.82 versus $0.57 as adjusted last year. Now to help investors better understand our earnings, taxes and the split between public shareholders and the non-controlling interest, the second quarter numbers are as follows. Starting with our pre-tax income of $541 million, we removed $1 million income at the holding company, then we deduct $12 million for income taxes paid by our operating companies, which are mostly foreign tax. This leaves $528 million, of which 78.1% or that $414 million reported on our income statement is attributable to non-controlling interests. The remaining 21.9% or $114 million is available for the public company shareholders. As this is a non-GAAP measure, it is not reported on our income statement. After we expense remaining taxes owed by the public company of $23 million on that $114 million, the net income available for common stockholders is the $92 million you see reported on our income statement. Note that the public company's tax is proportionately higher than last year, primarily because IBG Inc's. ownership rose from 18.6% to 21.9%. Our total income tax expense of $35 million consists of this $23 million plus the $12 million of taxes paid by the operating company. Turning to the balance sheet, with $9.9 billion in consolidated equity at June 30, 2021, we're well capitalized from a regulatory standpoint. We deploy our strong capital base toward opportunities to grow our business and investment opportunities worldwide as well as to emphasize the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners. Our capital is deployed across 14 registered broker-dealer type entities around the world, supporting regulatory capital requirements, liquidity needs, margin lending, and other financing opportunities in our growing brokerage business. And we continue to carry no long-term debt. Now I'll turn the call back over to the moderator, and we will take questions. I can take the first one certainly. Yes, our fully interest rate-sensitive credit amount to about 14% of the total credit, about $11.2 billion at the end of the quarter. So that can give you an idea of the portion on which we can fully capture any other rate increases. And to the second, I would turn that one over to Thomas with regard to investment policy on \u2013 depending on the yield curve, I guess, is really your question, yes? If I can comment, Thomas. Sure. Sure. I mean as we always say, it's driven by both as the customer base grows and balances grow, it is driven by higher short balances and greater inventory to lend, but it is most particularly driven by stocks that get hot in the marketplace. And for some period of time, sometimes very short, sometimes an extended period of time, we can lend them out at very high rate. And so we had some experience with that this past quarter, we had more in the first quarter. These stocks just come and go as you can read about them in the news. We are just able to take advantage of them, both because our customers borrow money against them, but also because we have a fully paid lending program, we call it Stock Yield Enhancement Program. And so, we have seen growth there, and it provides us opportunities to increase revenues because we are now lending out more of our customers' stock in that program. Well, certainly, the greater inventory we have, the more likely it is that we have more shares in the high rate stocks to lend. And this feeds on itself, as Thomas said, as our low rates attract more margin lending that frees up those \u2013 that body of stocks for us to lend. On that, we earn 100% of the revenue because they are margin stock. And on the fully paid stocks, we share that revenue generally 50-50 with our customer. Fully paid mean, it's either fully paid even in a cash account or in a margin account where there may be margin borrowing by the customer, that's not the full amount of margin borrowing that the customer can put on, which leads some of the stocks to be not collateralizing margin loans, and therefore, they are fully paid, and we can still lend them out. And in fact, the customer will earn something on those shares."

            "name": "Thomas Peterffy",
            "content": "So we're going to remain invested for the short-term, because I wouldn't dare to go out very far on the yield curve, especially with these rising inflation prospects. But as to your first question, that first half percent is just completely ours, right, you understand it. So when [indiscernible] rates go to 0.5%, that is completely ours. From thereon, we share. But our clients with less than $100,000, they have only about sum total of $10 billion. It's not because we are not further out, I mean we went out maybe a year. But it's mostly because the first half percent is \u2013 it's a huge amount of money on $85 billion of free cash we're sitting on, customer cash. So, I cannot foresee any change because basically this has been the business of Wall Street for 200 years now, namely customer order comes in and the firm trades against it, right. Now all that is happening with Schwab and Robinhood [indiscernible] on the other is that they are two different companies. But \u2013 so if they prohibited order flow, what would happen is Schwab will buy Virtu, and Citadel will buy Robinhood, right. And the same thing would just continue, right. So, I don't think that the annual \u2013 the payment for order flow can be prohibited. It just unbundles the traditional Wall Street model. China continues to be weaker, even weaker than it was in the previous quarter. And I mean it went out to practically nothing. And Hong Kong is just \u2013 it is certainly not as strong as it was a year ago, but it sort of continues. Otherwise, there is Europe, especially Eastern Europe, the Middle East, South America, these are especially strong. Well, in the mix, maybe there are some smaller customers, but we also get larger customers in there due to our institutional efforts such as the prop trading firms and the investment advisors. So overall, there isn't a substantial difference in the mix and the size of customers. My best guess is 30%. I am aware that May was lower, June was also lower, not \u2013 although not 23%, but I think more like 27%. But my best guess going forward is 30%. So, it is not paying the traders, new traders, it's aimed at existing folks that decide to hang up their hats for a while and not trade and so what they have been doing is they close their accounts and then \u2013 in order to save the inactivity fee. And so they come back a year or 2 years later, but they won't necessarily come back to us. They go to some other broker. So, that's what we want to prevent. So, we want to \u2013 we would like to hold on to the people who have had accounts with us. We want them to continue to have a concept of even if they become inactive for a while. And so that their account is open, even if they just leave a few dollars and then when they are ready to invest again, they will do it with us. I didn't understand the first word, security funding you said? Lending. Okay. I would add to that, that our especially low margin rates brings in a lot of clients who want to carry positions on margin. And as you know, those positions are available to us to lend. So, there is a benefit to charging a very low margin rate. I would guess about 25,000 accounts a year, but that's a guess. So, there is no financial impact to speak of. But our competitors were advertising these similar simple rates, our issue was that our rates are not so simple. And the \u2013 so we now can say that it's \u20ac3 or some \u00a33 whatever your currency is. And so it competes well with other folks in the marketplace. So, we have an outright agreement with some of our customers in which we agree, they agree that we can lend out their shares that are fully paid for, and we agreed to hold them on as far as the credit risk. So, we guarantee them against credit risk and we keep them have the proceeds."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Nancy Stuebe, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call but asked me to present his comments on the business. He will handle the Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. Q1 was an absolutely spectacular quarter. I have never seen anything like this in over 50 years on Wall Street, and those are Thomas\u2019 years, not my years. While we have had some other very active quarters in the past, there were two unique features about this one. First, that it seemingly happened in parallel and in tandem across all geographies around the globe; and second, that the feverish activity appeared to be led much more by individual investors than by institutions. You can explain all this by the combination of both the slowly spreading electronic connectedness of individuals to each other and to institutions and businesses, including the financial markets as well as by the sudden worldwide spread of the virus. The activity started to rise slowly, along with the advancement of the virus in March 2020, picking up speed toward the end of the year. It reached its crescendo towards the end of February and has been subsiding since. Where will we end up? I think the impact of the virus will disappear, but the resulting increasing reliance by the public on electronic communications, on working and meeting from a distance, and on gathering in larger asynchronous groups, including groups of investors, will remain. As for Interactive Brokers, I would expect that the sudden growth spurt will soon be over, and we'll return to our historic account growth rate in the high 20s percent, but now from a substantially higher base, and that is only if of our many new tools, products, or ideas that we continuously develop and add to the platform, none really hit the jackpot. If they do, we'll grow faster. Just kidding, we do not realize that any one particular feature or aspect of our platform will hit the jackpot, but what we do expect is that as we become better at enabling our customers to navigate through our numerous high-quality features at ever greater efficiency and as we establish individualized work environments and tools for them, the superior customer experience will become ever better known and spread by word of mouth. And now to go over these outsized numbers. We ended the quarter with a record 1,325,000 accounts, a net increase of over 565,000 from March 2020 or 74%. We saw account growth in all client segments and all geographic regions. In fact, accounts grew nearly equally in the three geographic regions we serve; the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Client equity more than doubled to a quarter-end record of $330 billion. As our customer base grew, DARTs and DARTs per account rose as well. Total DARTs for the first quarter were $3.3 million, up 128% over last year and 57% over the fourth quarter, while DARTs per account rose to 622, the highest in nearly 10 years. While our business is strong even with moderate volatility, the highly automated nature of our platform and our low-cost structure mean that higher trading activity sends a greater proportion of revenues to our bottom line. This quarter, our pretax margins were strong at 72%. Adjusted for noncore items, our pretax margin reached 68%, up from 61% a year ago. In addition, our capital base has grown even stronger during this period with total equity reaching $9.4 billion this quarter. This base has helped us to attract larger customers as well as reassure the increasing number of clients looking to participate in the markets. We saw growth, including record growth in some segments and in all five of the client types that we service. I will now go over our five client segments. Individual customers who made up 62% of our accounts, 36% of our client equity, and 54% of our commissions continued their run of record growth this quarter, with 12-month account growth more than doubling to 107% and even higher client equity growth of 109% while commissions grew 66%. This includes the roughly 57,000 less active accounts we took over from Goldman's Folio purchase. In addition to the aforementioned factors, continued active interest in the markets by investors worldwide, increases in market indices and investor desire to improve on the zero interest rate environment alternatives are some of the reasons behind the strength. All geographic areas we serve saw triple-digit growth in individuals with close to uniform growth rates across the Americas, Europe, and Asia. This proves the importance of providing a reliable platform to a global audience, offering wide product choices and worldwide access and demonstrates that clients want the maximum opportunities to invest in a variety of ways they prefer. We continue to see growth in the Hedge Fund customer segment. For the 12 months ended March 31, we saw 3% Hedge Fund account growth, 69% customer equity growth, and 12% commission growth. Strong customer equity growth well outpaced industry asset growth of under 10%. We continue to benefit from our reputation for best price execution, low and transparent margin and securities financing rates, the quality of our platform, and the strength of our balance sheet, and we keep inching up in Prequin\u2019s ranking of prime broker custodians. Hedge funds represent 1% of our accounts, 7% of our client equity, and 6% of our commissions. Proprietary trading firms are 2% of our accounts, 9% of client equity, and 13% of commissions. For the quarter, this group grew by 35% in accounts for the 12-month period, 57% in client equity and 31% in commissions. Prop trading firms are sensitive to the direction of volatility and trade more as volatility increases. Continuing strong volatility led to more active trading strategies, while accounts and client equity grew due to more traders wanting to be on our platform to capitalize on its reputation for seamlessness and efficient trade executions. Financial advisers are 10% of our accounts, 16% of our customer equity, and 11% of our commissions. This group grew accounts by 21% for the 12-month period, customer equity by 66%, and commissions by 11%. Account and client equity growth showed our increasing penetration of this segment. Commissions were up by less than account and equity growth as advisers typically tend to trade more conservatively. Our independent adviser business is small relative to Fidelity or Schwab. But while these firms emphasize the adviser and individual segments only, we also cater to hedge funds and prop traders who are a more demanding group as far as certain functionality is concerned. We build infrastructure for each client segment and make it available to all. As a result, our platform has the richest set of tools and capabilities. And with this strategy, we get better and grow faster in each of our customer segments than our peers. As published reports indicate, when RIAs are asked to rank nine brokers, Schwab, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, LPL, Edward Jones, Stifel, Raymond James and Interactive Brokers, our RIA offering ranks third of the nine among most liked and seventh of the nine, among most disliked. Even more promising, we were also the most improved from year-to-year among all. Large advisers would work best by using three custodians and giving us the most active and most leveraged accounts due to our superior execution and margin rates. Our final segment is introducing brokers. These represent 26% of our accounts, 32% of our client equity and 16% of our commissions. IBroker segment account growth was 48% for the latest 12 months, while client equity more than doubled, growing 169% and commissions by 105%. Interactive Brokers platform provides the global trading and seamless back office functionality critical for brokers who want to provide a global offering so they can capture clients worldwide to seek to invest and want to be able to access many markets in order to do so. We are excited about the opportunities for 2021. We have placed enhanced focus on our marketing efforts, and we've continued to increase spending in this area over the past year and continue \u2013 and expect to continue to do so this year. We are coming out in the current quarter with several new, exciting tools and products. It is this endless precession of new Interactive Brokers products and services that is the foundation of our rapid growth. In this regard, quality truly outshines quantity. More and more online brokers pop up every day all over the world. They all offer trading tools, trade executions and custody and each has some angle that is their specialty. But how are they going to compete with the established brokers platforms that have been evolving for many years, they will not be able to. It is the platforms with the best all-in prices and highest-quality of tools and services that will ultimately attract those users who seriously search for what suits them the best. This is our moat, and we will continue to widen it this year and onwards. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter.\nPaul Brody: Thank you, Nancy. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. As usual, I'll start by reviewing our first quarter operating results and the non-core items, the main factors that drove those numbers, and then we'll open it up for questions. Beginning with the operating data, record levels of account openings and trading drove strong operating metrics, aided by a continuing high global market participation in the phase of zero to negative interest rates. While market volatility came down a bit, industry volumes, especially in stocks and options, continued their upward march and trading by our active trader customer base surpassed even the industry's risk increases. Volatility, as measured by the average VIX fell from the unusually high levels it reached last year at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, a time of great uncertainty. The average VIX fell from 31 in the first quarter last year to 23 this quarter, consistent with the mid-20 s levels seen in the second half of 2020. Continued global interest in financial markets, amid the search for higher yields led to higher industry trading volumes in most products. Compared to the first quarter of 2020, our quarterly total DARTs more than doubled, rising 128% to a record $3.3 million. Our customer trade volumes rose dramatically in several product classes, led by increases of 72% and 411% in options and stock volumes, respectively. Stock volume was inflated by trading in low-priced stocks, though even after removing that effect, the share volume still rose 134%. Futures volumes declined 17% due to this quarter's comparison to the extremely active futures volume of March 2020, but this quarter still ranked as our fifth highest. FX dollar volumes this quarter were lower as investors turn their focus to equity market. Total accounts reached a record of $1.325 million, up 74% over the prior year, contributing to customer equity more than doubling from the first quarter of 2020 to $330.6 billion. Our overall average cleared commission per commissionable order fell 30% versus last year to $2.31. On a product mix that featured smaller average trade sizes and options, futures and ForEx. Another factor contributing to this decline was our continued success in capturing liquidity rebates, some or all of which are passed through to our clients. These rebates reduce the overall commission our client\u2019s pay, which decreases the average commission per DART, but they also reduced the exchange fees we pay on the expense side, making their overall impact neutral to our bottom line. Moving to our net interest margin table. Our net interest margin narrowed from 1.45% to 1.26% year-over-year, partially but not fully impacted by the drop in average U.S. benchmark fed funds rate from 125 basis points to 8 basis points and as most rates worldwide remained at or below zero. In light of the flat yield curve, we kept the duration of our portfolio relatively short and recorded an immaterial mark-to-market loss on our holdings of U.S. treasuries. Outside the U.S., benchmark interest rates remain zero or negative, nearly all currencies as central banks continue trying to soften the impact from the pandemic. This has led over the past few quarters, due interest earned on credit balances where we pass-through negative rate costs on these currencies. As a reminder, about quarter of our customer credit balances are not in U.S. dollars, and so changes in rates that occur in the U.S. do not apply to all of our balances. Securities lending and margin loans were the largest contributors to our net interest income. Securities lending was particularly strong this quarter, utilizing our in-house developed system, our team executed on opportunities to lend hard-to-borrow names and investors were looking to short. Net interest income from securities lending reached a record $175 million this quarter, up 182% year-over-year. Average margin loan balances rose 47% versus last year as investors grew more comfortable taking on risk and leverage even with the decline in the fed funds effective rate to near zero, higher year-over-year balances led to only a 16% decline in margin loan interest income from $139 million to $117 million. Lower rates also reduced our earnings on segregated cash, where despite a 38% increase in segregated cash balances, interest income fell along with benchmark rates. Drop in yield from 6 basis points in the fourth quarter to 2 basis points in this quarter was also affected by inflows in currencies with negative interest rates. Note that for accounting purposes, our FDIC sweep program, which expanded by 11% over the prior year, removes funds that would otherwise be included in segregated cash balances on our balance sheet. Now for our estimate of the impact of the next 25 basis point increase in rates and calculating the impact of rate changes, we understand that as the possibility of a future rate increases becomes more certain, this expectation is typically already reflected in the yields of the instruments in which we invest. Therefore, we attempt to isolate the impact of an unexpected rise or fall in rates, separate from the impact of rate hikes or cuts that have already been baked into the prices of these instruments. With that assumption, we would expect the next 25 basis point unanticipated rise in rates to produce an additional $105 million in net interest income over the next four quarters and $110 million as the yearly run rate based on our current balance sheet. Our net interest income is highly sensitive to small rate increases due to the impact of low benchmark rates on the spread between what we earn on our segregated cash and what we pay to our customers. As U.S. rates fell below 50 basis points, our spread compressed as we earn less on our segregated cash. However, the converse is also true that as rates move back up towards 50 basis points, the spread rise. The $110 million run rate includes the reinvestment of all of our present holdings at the new assumed rate, but does not take into account any change in how we may manage our segregated cash. A 25 basis point unanticipated fall in rates would produce a decline in net interest income of $37 million over the next four quarters and $38 million as the yearly run rate. Turning to the income statement. We define non-core items as those not part of our fundamental operating results, non-core adjusting items versus the year ago quarter. Our currency diversification strategy lost $49 million a year ago versus a loss of $2 million this quarter, so a comparative increase in income of $47 million. Investment gains and losses rose from a loss of $11 million to a gain of $99 million this quarter for a $110 million swing. And mark-to-market on U.S. government securities went from an $11 million gain to zero this quarter, a comparative decrease of $11 million. The net effect of these adjustments increased pretax income by $97 million this quarter, a positive shift of $146 million over last year\u2019s quarter. Net revenues were a reported $893 million for the quarter, up 68% versus last year\u2019s first quarter. Excluding non-core items, net revenue was up 37% to $796 million. Commission revenue rose 53% on significantly higher volumes, particularly in stock and options. Our average cleared commission per commissionable order was $2.31. As noted earlier, smaller average trade sizes in options, futures and ForEx as well as our continued successful capturing of execution rebates, which largely are passed back to clients contributed to this number. Net interest income rose 19% to $305 million despite a 118 basis point decline in the average effective Fed funds rate versus the year ago quarter. Thanks to growth in our balance sheet, higher-margin loan balances and our successful securities lending effort. Other fees and services revenues, which include market data, exposure, account activity, FDIC bank sweep program and IPO facilitation fees as well as order flow income from options exchange mandated program, rose 47% to $56 million. The top three contributors were market data fees, which were up $6 million; options order flow income, which was up $3 million; and IPO facilitation fees, which were up $7 million. Other income, which includes the gains and losses on our investments and currency diversification strategy as well as principal transactions swung to a gain of $120 million from a loss of $31 million in last year\u2019s quarter. Ex-noncore items, other income increased 25% to $23 million. Non-interest expenses were $254 million for the quarter, up 13% from last year. Larger exchange liquidity rebates drove a 12% reduction in execution, clearing and distribution fees to $68 million despite the higher volume. As mentioned, a portion of these rebates are passed through to our clients and are reflected in reduced commission. Fixed expenses were $184 million, up 31%, driven by a 21% increase in compensation and benefits, in line with the hiring that supports our growing brokerage business and by G&A expense. At quarter end, our total headcount stood at 2,187, a 28% increase over last year. We have been hiring aggressively in client services to support the influx of new accounts, as well as in compliance and software development. This quarter, G&A included $19 million related to licenses and fees required to set up operations in Europe due to Brexit. Going forward, we will have some annual regulatory fees as we do in all countries in which we are registered, but this $19 million will not be recurring. Customer bad debt expense was $2 million, well contained for a highly active trading period. Reported pretax income more than doubled from last year\u2019s quarter to $639 million for a 72% pretax margin. And excluding non-core items, pretax income rose 52% to $542 million or a 68% pretax margin. Diluted earnings per share were $1.16 for the quarter versus $0.60 in the same period in 2020. And ex-noncore items, diluted earnings per share were $0.98 versus $0.69 as adjusted last year. To help investors better understand our earnings, taxes and the split between public shareholders and the non-controlling interest, the first quarter numbers are as follows. Starting with our pretax income of $639 million, we deduct $26 million for income taxes paid by our operating company, which are mostly foreign tax. Note that we had a $6 million addition to what we normally would have expensed related in part to consolidating our European operations in the aftermath of Brexit. This leaves $613 million, of which 78.2% or that $479 million reported on our income statement is attributable to non-controlling interest. The remaining 21.8% or $134 million is available to the public company shareholders. As this is a non-GAAP measure, it is not reported on our income statement. After we expense remaining taxes owed by the public company of $27 million on that $134 million, the net income available for common stockholders is the $107 million you see reported on our income statement. Note that the public company\u2019s tax disproportionately higher, primarily because IBG Inc.\u2019s ownership rose from 18.5% to 21.8%. Our income tax expense of $53 million consists of this $27 million, plus the $26 million of taxes paid by the operating company. Turning to the balance sheet with $9.4 billion in consolidated equity at March 31, 2021. We\u2019re well capitalized from a regulatory standpoint. We deploy our strong capital base toward opportunities to grow our business and investing opportunities worldwide as well as to emphasize the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners. Our capital is deployed across 14 registered broker-dealer type entities around the world, supporting regulatory capital requirements, liquidity needs, margin lending and other financing opportunities in our growing brokerage business. And we continue to carry no long-term debt. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the moderator, and we will take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good evening, everyone. Hope you\u2019re all doing well.\nThomas Peterffy: Yes, thank you.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So, Thomas, starting on capital management, where is the point where you think you have enough capital, and I\u2019m especially thinking about your Hedge Fund prime business, where you could start raising the dividend to a more comparable level to some of your peers?\nThomas Peterffy: We are not looking at raising the dividend. We are still, as you heard Paul say, we have 14 entities, broker-dealers around the world, and we need more capital actually than we have. So \u2013 and we also have some opportunities as far as IPOs are concerned that need capital to be able to finance the subscriptions. So, it is \u2013 it\u2019s not \u2013 there is no \u2013 not going to be a dividend increase into the near future.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Thomas. And I just had a modeling follow-up maybe for Paul, but execution and clearing costs were quite low again. Can you talk about what was in the 1Q run rate, what we should expect for 2Q? And if there\u2019s also any impact from exchange rebates?\nPaul Brody: Well, there\u2019s definitely an impact from the exchange rebates as I mentioned. But again, most of that is passed through to the customers in the form of reduced commissions. So, you\u2019ll see it come out of the expense line, but also the revenue line. One of the things we\u2019ve been able to do over time or certainly over the last year is improve our software to \u2013 our routing software to optimize the routing of orders to maximize the rebates that we can then pass-through to our customers. And we\u2019re constantly looking at improving all of those systems in that regard. So \u2013 but to the bottom line, it might have a small impact, but because we\u2019re passing them through to our customers, the biggest impact is a better deal for the customer.\nThomas Peterffy: So, another thing I need to add here is we are placing emphasis, great deal of emphasis on trying to execute match orders in our dark pools because that is the way we can provide best execution when we \u2013 now that we have 3.3 million trades a day, it is becoming lucrative. Our dark pool becomes a lucrative place for institutional traders to try to participate in interacting with that order flow. So, if we can get more and more institutional traders into our dark pool to indicate their non-urgent orders and that we can match them up with the retail flow as it come [indiscernible] in, everybody benefits, and we don\u2019t have an execution cost.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Thomas.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open.\nChris Allen: I just wanted to follow-up on the question, the commentary around the dark pool becoming more interesting. I can\u2019t recall you guys ever talking about your dark pool before, maybe you can give us some metrics in terms of any \u2013 what volume is currently executed on the dark pool, what\u2019s matched up out of your total trades right now?\nThomas Peterffy: It\u2019s approaching 30%.\nChris Allen: Got it. All right. And then switching gears a little bit. I noted you\u2019re talking about increasing your marketing efforts. Historically, word-of-mouth has been your primary catalyst to drive new account growth. Any color in terms of how you\u2019re expanding your marketing efforts? You have new hires direct in community or are you looking at different channels from a marketing perspective?\nThomas Peterffy: We have new hires on the one hand. And also, yes, we are looking at more regional marketing around the world. It is very initial phases, it\u2019s in infancy, it\u2019s in infancy still, but we are going to try to have a more regionalized marketing effort because we find that people are more comfortable, for example, in their native language around the \u2013 et cetera.\nChris Allen: Got it. So, it\u2019s fair to say, you\u2019re starting from a fairly low base in terms of your existing marketing efforts, specifically on the regional front?\nThomas Peterffy: That\u2019s correct. I mean, our marketing expenses currently are around $40 million to $50 million a year.\nChris Allen: Got it. And then last one for me before I jump back in the queue. Some recent articles quoted, I think, an IBKR spokesman saying you\u2019re going to be launching cryptocurrency effort this summer. Just wondering if you have any color on that, how do you approach that market from a cost of [ph] storage perspective and source of liquidity, et cetera, any color would be great.\nThomas Peterffy: I think it was a spokeswoman. And actually, it\u2019s \u2013 we do not disclose these things. So, as you know, whenever we come up with something, we\u2019re very likely to be followed by all of our peers. So, we like to have our cards close to or chest until we\u2019re ready to play.\nChris Allen: Understood. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nRich Repetto: Thank you. Good evening, Thomas. Good evening, Paul. So, the over-the-top number that jumps out at me is the securities lending revenue. So, $175 million and if you look at it, it looks like double sort of a run rate of -- quarterly run rate of last year. So, can you give us \u2013 I guess this is for Paul, can you give us any color like how \u2013 what drove that or how you exited throughout the quarter, January, February, and March? And what \u2013 I don\u2019t know, what drove that? I mean, we didn\u2019t see it at peers like \u2013 not up that much like peers like Schwab.\nThomas Peterffy: Well, I\u2019m happy to answer that, if I may. You see \u2013 this is a revenue source that is very slightly, and it has to do with whether you have a substantial quantity of any stock that is difficult to borrow, and therefore commands a higher rate. Now, it just so happened that there was one and maybe a couple of other issues that had a high lending rate, and we had happened to have a great deal of it, so that\u2019s the reason for that.\nRich Repetto: So would you suggest, as we look forward, that we go back to more of the run rate of last year, more of a \u2013 which is about half of that? Is that probably the best way to...\nThomas Peterffy: Yes, yes.\nRich Repetto: So Thomas, the other thing was the 74% year-over-year comp growth and it seems like you're being reasonably very conservative in going back, I guess, suggesting that we go back to the 20% year-over-year account growth. And I guess, my questions are, these accounts, the boost that we got in the first quarter, do we get it \u2013 isn't there \u2013 will there be an impact of season \u2013 what do you call, seasoning impact to balances maybe margin balances, deposit and equity balances of this. You suggested in the past that they don't fund immediately, that it takes a year to a year and a half. So could we expect an uptick in some of the balances even though we might go to a more, what you call, normalize account growth rate?\nThomas Peterffy: Yes, that is correct. But first of all, don't forget that 57,000 of these new accounts came from the Folio acquisition from Goldman, right? And they tend to be small accounts and very inactive accounts, so as far as those accounts are concerned, we are not expecting any growth. Now, it is generally true that when somebody opens an account with us, initially, they put in a little bit of money and gradually over the next year or two, it increases and yes, that is correct. So to the extent that we have a sharper increase in new accounts, we can expect some follow-on funding on those accounts.\nRich Repetto: I understood and even if you subtract the 57,000, it was still highly elevated by historical standards anyway.\nThomas Peterffy: That's right.\nRich Repetto: Anyway, I guess, my last question was on the need for capital that you talked about, Thomas. Is there any way like, I believe the cash, if you look at cash and what do you call, regulated cash, I believe that went up from $20 billion to $24 billion and the capital is at $9.4 billion. So I guess, my question is, how do you \u2013 is there any way we can sort of ballpark like how you come up with the number that you need more capital for these?\nThomas Peterffy: Yes, I\u2019ve great \u2013 I have a great idea for you. Talk to our CFO.\nRich Repetto: I'd love to talk to him.\nPaul Brody: So, Rich, the \u2013 yeah, sure. The \u2013 what it boils down to is we have all these different regulatory jurisdictions and each one has a different set of rules, so some are more flexible than others. In the U.S. when you see that our customers put in more money, deposit more money with us, much of that money will be available to lend to other customers who are borrowing money secured by their marginal stock, but in other jurisdictions, that's not the case. One has to separate and customer money in the bank and then finance the margin lending. So you can't infer from increased credit balances that they are available to fund increased financing and so that put certain constraints on us. And as we grow greatly in our non-U.S. affiliate, we had some commensurate need, growing need to have more of our own capital and then and on top \u2013 and that's on top of having to maintain a certain amount of regulatory net capital, which we do and we keep excess for all of the \u2013 all the right reason. But it's fragmented and it's devoted to these things which are opportunity. So as Thomas says, as he said before, rather than dividending it out, we're more likely to keep it and in fact, try to try to expand on it.\nRich Repetto: Okay, just one little quick thing is, if \u2013 he also said you would need more. So what's the target, if you're at $9.4 billion, what are you targeting then?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, it all \u2013 it depends on how many more offices we are going to open up and how strongly the customer base and the margin borrowings grow in areas, where we are unable to use our customers' deposits. And so it's \u2013 I don't have a crystal ball. I think we could very easily use $12 billion at this moment, is that roughly right, Paul?\nPaul Brody: Sure. We certainly have the capacity to utilize it, yeah.\nThomas Peterffy: Yeah.\nRich Repetto: Got it, that's helpful, Thomas. Thank you, both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Nance with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nWilliam Nance: Hi. Good afternoon. Thomas, maybe I can ask a follow-up question on the account growth and some of the discussion around marketing earlier. I mean, if I go back kind of prior to the pandemic, you were growing accounts kind of 10,000 to 15,000 a month, something in that ballpark. Obviously, that's gone up quite a bit and I hear you are not wanting to kind of promise the kind of growth that we've seen more recently going forward. But I think if I kind of take a step back, I look at a lot of the new entrants into the broker space even some of the large competitors in the U.S. like a Schwab for instance. You're seeing pretty large numbers in terms of the account growth and a lot of that is just focused in the U.S. When you kind of think about the global opportunity that you guys have and there's kind of opportunity to grow accounts, I mean, what makes you think that we necessarily are going to go down back to kind of lower levels going forward. And I guess, given the kind of market we're in, why wouldn't you be kind of significantly increasing the investments in marketing in order to kind of take advantage of that opportunity?\nThomas Peterffy: We will, we will. But \u2013 so our historical \u2013 if I look at our annual report, our five-year account growth rate is 27%. So yeah, I mean, 30% expectation would be quite reasonable. I just think that a lot of the people who are ready to open account, who are thinking about opening their account or open the account at the time when they had to stay at home and they had nothing to do, they finally got around to it. So we had a potential group of \u2013 a large group of people who are potentially adding and they've all done it. So I think that now, there is a smaller group that we can await for them to open their account. Eventually, that will even out and we\u2019ll be back to the historical average. I do not see why going forward, there would be a \u2013 other than our enhanced marketing effort, which is, of course, right. But otherwise, I don't see why there would be a much larger appetite for accounts than there used to be.\nWilliam Nance: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then just maybe a question on margin balances. They've been obviously very strong recently, basically at all-time highs. And yet when we kind of look at it relative to client equity, they don't appear particularly elevated kind of as a percentage of client assets. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about the propensity of some of the recent client cohorts to trade on margin. And maybe if you look kind of under the hood among the various client segments, how would you \u2013 how would you kind of characterize margin balances today kind of relative to history, kind of under the hood and kind of adjusted for mix?\nThomas Peterffy: So I \u2013 well the numbers I'm seeing, and of course, I look at shorter-term numbers. I see margin loans expanding at the healthy rate than \u2013 so I don't see the way you see. You must have looked at some very long-term numbers, right?\nWilliam Nance: Yes. I mean, I think historically, you would see kind of margin balances in sort of like mid-teens as a percentage of client equity. And I think just given the significant increase in equity over the past year or so, even though the margin balances are up a lot in absolute terms, kind of on a relative basis, they've kind of kept pace and don't appear particularly elevated, I guess. So I guess my point is, when you look at it under the hood, does it actually feel somewhat elevated today? Do you think there's plenty of more room to go? Could we actually see it return to those kind of mid-teens levels that we used to see?\nThomas Peterffy: So as I often say, it's the most frustrating area for me, I do not understand why it is that we offer the lowest margin rate in the world, and we don't have all the margin loans. But it is what it is. So I'm somewhat stunned. Sorry.\nWilliam Nance: Sounds like maybe there is an opportunity. All right. Thank you, Thomas. Appreciate you taking all my questions.\nThomas Peterffy: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nDan Fannon: Thank you. I was wondering if you could talk about the account growth by region. I think you said that it was equally spread out amongst U.S., Europe and Asia and maybe go in a little bit deeper in terms of those markets. And then as you go \u2013 as you're seeing things moderate or slow down or get back to what might be viewed as more normal levels. Are there any regions that are slowing down faster in these kinds of recent days and weeks of activity? Or is it more broad-based?\nThomas Peterffy: Right. So no, the slowdown is the fastest in China and Hong Kong. It must have something to do with the Chinese government cracking down on banks that send out money. So our customers find it difficult to fund accounts. And our China and Hong Kong used to be our fastest growing region. And it suddenly has become practically our slowest growing region. So yes, the answer is that's where the greatest change has occurred. Otherwise, the \u2013 maybe the fastest growth lately has been from the Middle East.\nDan Fannon: Great. And the follow-up on the...\nThomas Peterffy: Currently stated.\nDan Fannon: Okay. And then a follow-up on expenses, understand the normalization of G&A, but maybe if there are any other kind of deals...\nThomas Peterffy: Hello? Your voice...\nDan Fannon: This is Dan. Can I ask my follow-up question on expenses if that's alright?\nThomas Peterffy: Yes. Please.\nDan Fannon: So just thinking about the remainder of this year, given what you called out in G&A, is there any kind of plan for known expenses that are outside of the normal hiring marketing that you've already mentioned as we think about just kind of the run rate of fixed cost?\nThomas Peterffy: I don't have any, so it's on that, Paul?\nPaul Brody: Nothing specific. We always try to point out when we have unusual expenses that we don't expect to recur like we did this time around. And G&A in general as Thomas said, we've been expanding on advertising and marketing. Otherwise, there is \u2013 if you take out the unusual item that's probably around the right run rate and your unusual items was about $19 million.\nDan Fannon: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good evening. Just another one on new accounts opened in the quarter. Even if you exclude those Folio accounts, still 200,000 accounts I mean, big account growth. I guess, I'm just curious if we can get some more color about the clients and I'm also wondering, if you think you saw a benefit from some outages at your competitors, but with respect to the client, just wondering average age, account sizes, are they similar to your existing client base or do they look \u2013 do they not look much different?\nThomas Peterffy: No, they are similar. So average age of our client is 43 years old. In the United States, it's 49 years old. So other parts of the world, it's more like 40 or 39, which then averages out to 43 and that's been fairly steady. So with our new accounts beyond there, I don't think so, because the 43 has been stable for a long time.\nKyle Voigt: Got it. Thank you. And then, there continues to be more talk of long-term capital gains rates being changed in the U.S. to ordinary income rates for certain income levels. So I'm just curious to hear if that would change your view on the dividend or changing something with capital return, if that were to happen?\nThomas Peterffy: So why would that entice us to payout more?\nKyle Voigt: I wasn't suggesting that. I was just curious if you change your capital return policy.\nThomas Peterffy: Well, you're kind of saying we would try to reach on a less in order to\u2026\nKyle Voigt: More importantly, more to maybe a buyback, would that be something that would be on the table or?\nThomas Peterffy: No, we certainly cannot do that because you see we have a very small float, right? So \u2013 and given the tax circumstance we are in, we cannot buy back our shares, is that helpful?\nPaul Brody: Well, as you say, we prefer to increase the float rather than reduce it, given that it's only 21.8%.\nThomas Peterffy: All right.\nKyle Voigt: Great. But dividend, but you would consider cutting the dividend in that case? Is that what you said, sorry?\nThomas Peterffy: No, we don't want to\u2026\nKyle Voigt: Okay, sorry. And then one last one for me. Thank you very much for taking my questions. The margin yield increased sequentially, was that due to \u2013that was probably more for Paul, was that due to a \u2013 the currency mix or was it more of the total margin being from lower balance tiers and therefore, is higher fee?\nPaul Brody: So you're talking about the\u2026\nKyle Voigt: The margin yield increase sequentially from 4Q to 1Q.\nPaul Brody: Sequentially?\nKyle Voigt: Yes.\nPaul Brody: Well, the margin loan balances were up 22% from the prior quarter.\nThomas Peterffy: Yes, and they come in smaller bites. It is coming in smaller bite, so they pay a higher rate, because the margin \u2013 our marginal rates vary from 75 basis points to what, 140 something?\nPaul Brody: It's about 157 now, with fed funds around 7 basis points.\nKyle Voigt: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nChris Harris: Thanks. So Thomas kind of a bigger picture industry question for you. This is an industry that's got a pretty long history of competing on price and I know you guys are leaders in that area in terms of; they will be really able to match you on price in a lot of parts of your business. But now that commissions are zero, what are your thoughts about there being more competition in other parts of the business like margin lending and pay rates on deposits, not necessarily at IB but at some of your competitors?\nThomas Peterffy: So look, I mean, we have the lowest margin rates. We don't see them being managed even though I understand why they don't. Look, you see, they are not matching them because they \u2013 people don't \u2013 the customer don't seem to pay any attention to the margin rates it seems. So they wouldn't want to cut the branch they are sitting on by lowering margins, right? Because it's \u2013 they are lending money at 6%, 7%, 8% and that's incredibly lucrative, so what they do, do is they negotiate if somebody calls. If somebody calls, so we go and get customers where we say look, why don't you come over, we have a huge margin balance and you are \u2013 let's say Ameritrade and you are paying this crazy rate and then they say, okay, okay, we will come over and two weeks later, they tell us, you know what, we called them and we told them and they said, okay, and they gave us a much, much lower rate almost matching yours. So we are not coming. So that's the story. In other words, they will not \u2013 caught the headline rates, but they will negotiate.\nChris Harris: Got you. All right. That makes sense. And a question about your introducing broker customer segment. Could you guys tell us like what percent, if you know, of IB's margin balances in sec lending revenue comes from that particular customer group, is it a high or low number?\nThomas Peterffy: I looked at it, but I don't know exactly. I'm sorry.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up question from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you. So if you take a step back, what are your thoughts on a more normalized growth rate as we head into 2012 relative to the account growth numbers you're experiencing now, especially after we strip out the Folio acquisition?\nThomas Peterffy: 30%. Hello?\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, Thomas, I heard you 30%?\nThomas Peterffy: 30%, right. I think about this all the time, so it's not I \u2013 even though I answered quickly, it's a very go through answer.\nCraig Siegenthaler: And Thomas, just a follow-up on one of the other 30%. You said 30% of all trades, including customer, non-clear customer, principal, where we're getting sent to the DART pool?\nThomas Peterffy: Yes \u2013 no, I didn't say that.\nCraig Siegenthaler: And where was that number a year ago?\nThomas Peterffy: Something like 28% or something. I don't know where it was a year ago. I started to pay attention to this just relatively recently and I know that it has grown. I don't know what it was, but we are placing more and more emphasis on that. We see a big opportunity there.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. Thomas, thank you for taking my questions.\nThomas Peterffy: All right.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Nancy for closing remarks.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website and we will also be posting a clean version of the transcript on our site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will talk to you next quarter end.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nancy Stuebe",
            "content": "Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call but asked me to present his comments on the business. He will handle the Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. Q1 was an absolutely spectacular quarter. I have never seen anything like this in over 50 years on Wall Street, and those are Thomas' years, not my years. While we have had some other very active quarters in the past, there were two unique features about this one. First, that it seemingly happened in parallel and in tandem across all geographies around the globe; and second, that the feverish activity appeared to be led much more by individual investors than by institutions. You can explain all this by the combination of both the slowly spreading electronic connectedness of individuals to each other and to institutions and businesses, including the financial markets as well as by the sudden worldwide spread of the virus. The activity started to rise slowly, along with the advancement of the virus in March 2020, picking up speed toward the end of the year. It reached its crescendo towards the end of February and has been subsiding since. Where will we end up? I think the impact of the virus will disappear, but the resulting increasing reliance by the public on electronic communications, on working and meeting from a distance, and on gathering in larger asynchronous groups, including groups of investors, will remain. As for Interactive Brokers, I would expect that the sudden growth spurt will soon be over, and we'll return to our historic account growth rate in the high 20s percent, but now from a substantially higher base, and that is only if of our many new tools, products, or ideas that we continuously develop and add to the platform, none really hit the jackpot. If they do, we'll grow faster. Just kidding, we do not realize that any one particular feature or aspect of our platform will hit the jackpot, but what we do expect is that as we become better at enabling our customers to navigate through our numerous high-quality features at ever greater efficiency and as we establish individualized work environments and tools for them, the superior customer experience will become ever better known and spread by word of mouth. And now to go over these outsized numbers. We ended the quarter with a record 1,325,000 accounts, a net increase of over 565,000 from March 2020 or 74%. We saw account growth in all client segments and all geographic regions. In fact, accounts grew nearly equally in the three geographic regions we serve; the Americas, Europe, and Asia. Client equity more than doubled to a quarter-end record of $330 billion. As our customer base grew, DARTs and DARTs per account rose as well. Total DARTs for the first quarter were $3.3 million, up 128% over last year and 57% over the fourth quarter, while DARTs per account rose to 622, the highest in nearly 10 years. While our business is strong even with moderate volatility, the highly automated nature of our platform and our low-cost structure mean that higher trading activity sends a greater proportion of revenues to our bottom line. This quarter, our pretax margins were strong at 72%. Adjusted for noncore items, our pretax margin reached 68%, up from 61% a year ago. In addition, our capital base has grown even stronger during this period with total equity reaching $9.4 billion this quarter. This base has helped us to attract larger customers as well as reassure the increasing number of clients looking to participate in the markets. We saw growth, including record growth in some segments and in all five of the client types that we service. I will now go over our five client segments. Individual customers who made up 62% of our accounts, 36% of our client equity, and 54% of our commissions continued their run of record growth this quarter, with 12-month account growth more than doubling to 107% and even higher client equity growth of 109% while commissions grew 66%. This includes the roughly 57,000 less active accounts we took over from Goldman's Folio purchase. In addition to the aforementioned factors, continued active interest in the markets by investors worldwide, increases in market indices and investor desire to improve on the zero interest rate environment alternatives are some of the reasons behind the strength. All geographic areas we serve saw triple-digit growth in individuals with close to uniform growth rates across the Americas, Europe, and Asia. This proves the importance of providing a reliable platform to a global audience, offering wide product choices and worldwide access and demonstrates that clients want the maximum opportunities to invest in a variety of ways they prefer. We continue to see growth in the Hedge Fund customer segment. For the 12 months ended March 31, we saw 3% Hedge Fund account growth, 69% customer equity growth, and 12% commission growth. Strong customer equity growth well outpaced industry asset growth of under 10%. We continue to benefit from our reputation for best price execution, low and transparent margin and securities financing rates, the quality of our platform, and the strength of our balance sheet, and we keep inching up in Prequin's ranking of prime broker custodians. Hedge funds represent 1% of our accounts, 7% of our client equity, and 6% of our commissions. Proprietary trading firms are 2% of our accounts, 9% of client equity, and 13% of commissions. For the quarter, this group grew by 35% in accounts for the 12-month period, 57% in client equity and 31% in commissions. Prop trading firms are sensitive to the direction of volatility and trade more as volatility increases. Continuing strong volatility led to more active trading strategies, while accounts and client equity grew due to more traders wanting to be on our platform to capitalize on its reputation for seamlessness and efficient trade executions. Financial advisers are 10% of our accounts, 16% of our customer equity, and 11% of our commissions. This group grew accounts by 21% for the 12-month period, customer equity by 66%, and commissions by 11%. Account and client equity growth showed our increasing penetration of this segment. Commissions were up by less than account and equity growth as advisers typically tend to trade more conservatively. Our independent adviser business is small relative to Fidelity or Schwab. But while these firms emphasize the adviser and individual segments only, we also cater to hedge funds and prop traders who are a more demanding group as far as certain functionality is concerned. We build infrastructure for each client segment and make it available to all. As a result, our platform has the richest set of tools and capabilities. And with this strategy, we get better and grow faster in each of our customer segments than our peers. As published reports indicate, when RIAs are asked to rank nine brokers, Schwab, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, LPL, Edward Jones, Stifel, Raymond James and Interactive Brokers, our RIA offering ranks third of the nine among most liked and seventh of the nine, among most disliked. Even more promising, we were also the most improved from year-to-year among all. Large advisers would work best by using three custodians and giving us the most active and most leveraged accounts due to our superior execution and margin rates. Our final segment is introducing brokers. These represent 26% of our accounts, 32% of our client equity and 16% of our commissions. IBroker segment account growth was 48% for the latest 12 months, while client equity more than doubled, growing 169% and commissions by 105%. Interactive Brokers platform provides the global trading and seamless back office functionality critical for brokers who want to provide a global offering so they can capture clients worldwide to seek to invest and want to be able to access many markets in order to do so. We are excited about the opportunities for 2021. We have placed enhanced focus on our marketing efforts, and we've continued to increase spending in this area over the past year and continue \u2013 and expect to continue to do so this year. We are coming out in the current quarter with several new, exciting tools and products. It is this endless precession of new Interactive Brokers products and services that is the foundation of our rapid growth. In this regard, quality truly outshines quantity. More and more online brokers pop up every day all over the world. They all offer trading tools, trade executions and custody and each has some angle that is their specialty. But how are they going to compete with the established brokers platforms that have been evolving for many years, they will not be able to. It is the platforms with the best all-in prices and highest-quality of tools and services that will ultimately attract those users who seriously search for what suits them the best. This is our moat, and we will continue to widen it this year and onwards. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website and we will also be posting a clean version of the transcript on our site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will talk to you next quarter end."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Paul Brody",
            "content": "Thank you, Nancy. Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. As usual, I'll start by reviewing our first quarter operating results and the non-core items, the main factors that drove those numbers, and then we'll open it up for questions. Beginning with the operating data, record levels of account openings and trading drove strong operating metrics, aided by a continuing high global market participation in the phase of zero to negative interest rates. While market volatility came down a bit, industry volumes, especially in stocks and options, continued their upward march and trading by our active trader customer base surpassed even the industry's risk increases. Volatility, as measured by the average VIX fell from the unusually high levels it reached last year at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, a time of great uncertainty. The average VIX fell from 31 in the first quarter last year to 23 this quarter, consistent with the mid-20 s levels seen in the second half of 2020. Continued global interest in financial markets, amid the search for higher yields led to higher industry trading volumes in most products. Compared to the first quarter of 2020, our quarterly total DARTs more than doubled, rising 128% to a record $3.3 million. Our customer trade volumes rose dramatically in several product classes, led by increases of 72% and 411% in options and stock volumes, respectively. Stock volume was inflated by trading in low-priced stocks, though even after removing that effect, the share volume still rose 134%. Futures volumes declined 17% due to this quarter's comparison to the extremely active futures volume of March 2020, but this quarter still ranked as our fifth highest. FX dollar volumes this quarter were lower as investors turn their focus to equity market. Total accounts reached a record of $1.325 million, up 74% over the prior year, contributing to customer equity more than doubling from the first quarter of 2020 to $330.6 billion. Our overall average cleared commission per commissionable order fell 30% versus last year to $2.31. On a product mix that featured smaller average trade sizes and options, futures and ForEx. Another factor contributing to this decline was our continued success in capturing liquidity rebates, some or all of which are passed through to our clients. These rebates reduce the overall commission our client's pay, which decreases the average commission per DART, but they also reduced the exchange fees we pay on the expense side, making their overall impact neutral to our bottom line. Moving to our net interest margin table. Our net interest margin narrowed from 1.45% to 1.26% year-over-year, partially but not fully impacted by the drop in average U.S. benchmark fed funds rate from 125 basis points to 8 basis points and as most rates worldwide remained at or below zero. In light of the flat yield curve, we kept the duration of our portfolio relatively short and recorded an immaterial mark-to-market loss on our holdings of U.S. treasuries. Outside the U.S., benchmark interest rates remain zero or negative, nearly all currencies as central banks continue trying to soften the impact from the pandemic. This has led over the past few quarters, due interest earned on credit balances where we pass-through negative rate costs on these currencies. As a reminder, about quarter of our customer credit balances are not in U.S. dollars, and so changes in rates that occur in the U.S. do not apply to all of our balances. Securities lending and margin loans were the largest contributors to our net interest income. Securities lending was particularly strong this quarter, utilizing our in-house developed system, our team executed on opportunities to lend hard-to-borrow names and investors were looking to short. Net interest income from securities lending reached a record $175 million this quarter, up 182% year-over-year. Average margin loan balances rose 47% versus last year as investors grew more comfortable taking on risk and leverage even with the decline in the fed funds effective rate to near zero, higher year-over-year balances led to only a 16% decline in margin loan interest income from $139 million to $117 million. Lower rates also reduced our earnings on segregated cash, where despite a 38% increase in segregated cash balances, interest income fell along with benchmark rates. Drop in yield from 6 basis points in the fourth quarter to 2 basis points in this quarter was also affected by inflows in currencies with negative interest rates. Note that for accounting purposes, our FDIC sweep program, which expanded by 11% over the prior year, removes funds that would otherwise be included in segregated cash balances on our balance sheet. Now for our estimate of the impact of the next 25 basis point increase in rates and calculating the impact of rate changes, we understand that as the possibility of a future rate increases becomes more certain, this expectation is typically already reflected in the yields of the instruments in which we invest. Therefore, we attempt to isolate the impact of an unexpected rise or fall in rates, separate from the impact of rate hikes or cuts that have already been baked into the prices of these instruments. With that assumption, we would expect the next 25 basis point unanticipated rise in rates to produce an additional $105 million in net interest income over the next four quarters and $110 million as the yearly run rate based on our current balance sheet. Our net interest income is highly sensitive to small rate increases due to the impact of low benchmark rates on the spread between what we earn on our segregated cash and what we pay to our customers. As U.S. rates fell below 50 basis points, our spread compressed as we earn less on our segregated cash. However, the converse is also true that as rates move back up towards 50 basis points, the spread rise. The $110 million run rate includes the reinvestment of all of our present holdings at the new assumed rate, but does not take into account any change in how we may manage our segregated cash. A 25 basis point unanticipated fall in rates would produce a decline in net interest income of $37 million over the next four quarters and $38 million as the yearly run rate. Turning to the income statement. We define non-core items as those not part of our fundamental operating results, non-core adjusting items versus the year ago quarter. Our currency diversification strategy lost $49 million a year ago versus a loss of $2 million this quarter, so a comparative increase in income of $47 million. Investment gains and losses rose from a loss of $11 million to a gain of $99 million this quarter for a $110 million swing. And mark-to-market on U.S. government securities went from an $11 million gain to zero this quarter, a comparative decrease of $11 million. The net effect of these adjustments increased pretax income by $97 million this quarter, a positive shift of $146 million over last year's quarter. Net revenues were a reported $893 million for the quarter, up 68% versus last year's first quarter. Excluding non-core items, net revenue was up 37% to $796 million. Commission revenue rose 53% on significantly higher volumes, particularly in stock and options. Our average cleared commission per commissionable order was $2.31. As noted earlier, smaller average trade sizes in options, futures and ForEx as well as our continued successful capturing of execution rebates, which largely are passed back to clients contributed to this number. Net interest income rose 19% to $305 million despite a 118 basis point decline in the average effective Fed funds rate versus the year ago quarter. Thanks to growth in our balance sheet, higher-margin loan balances and our successful securities lending effort. Other fees and services revenues, which include market data, exposure, account activity, FDIC bank sweep program and IPO facilitation fees as well as order flow income from options exchange mandated program, rose 47% to $56 million. The top three contributors were market data fees, which were up $6 million; options order flow income, which was up $3 million; and IPO facilitation fees, which were up $7 million. Other income, which includes the gains and losses on our investments and currency diversification strategy as well as principal transactions swung to a gain of $120 million from a loss of $31 million in last year's quarter. Ex-noncore items, other income increased 25% to $23 million. Non-interest expenses were $254 million for the quarter, up 13% from last year. Larger exchange liquidity rebates drove a 12% reduction in execution, clearing and distribution fees to $68 million despite the higher volume. As mentioned, a portion of these rebates are passed through to our clients and are reflected in reduced commission. Fixed expenses were $184 million, up 31%, driven by a 21% increase in compensation and benefits, in line with the hiring that supports our growing brokerage business and by G&A expense. At quarter end, our total headcount stood at 2,187, a 28% increase over last year. We have been hiring aggressively in client services to support the influx of new accounts, as well as in compliance and software development. This quarter, G&A included $19 million related to licenses and fees required to set up operations in Europe due to Brexit. Going forward, we will have some annual regulatory fees as we do in all countries in which we are registered, but this $19 million will not be recurring. Customer bad debt expense was $2 million, well contained for a highly active trading period. Reported pretax income more than doubled from last year's quarter to $639 million for a 72% pretax margin. And excluding non-core items, pretax income rose 52% to $542 million or a 68% pretax margin. Diluted earnings per share were $1.16 for the quarter versus $0.60 in the same period in 2020. And ex-noncore items, diluted earnings per share were $0.98 versus $0.69 as adjusted last year. To help investors better understand our earnings, taxes and the split between public shareholders and the non-controlling interest, the first quarter numbers are as follows. Starting with our pretax income of $639 million, we deduct $26 million for income taxes paid by our operating company, which are mostly foreign tax. Note that we had a $6 million addition to what we normally would have expensed related in part to consolidating our European operations in the aftermath of Brexit. This leaves $613 million, of which 78.2% or that $479 million reported on our income statement is attributable to non-controlling interest. The remaining 21.8% or $134 million is available to the public company shareholders. As this is a non-GAAP measure, it is not reported on our income statement. After we expense remaining taxes owed by the public company of $27 million on that $134 million, the net income available for common stockholders is the $107 million you see reported on our income statement. Note that the public company's tax disproportionately higher, primarily because IBG Inc.'s ownership rose from 18.5% to 21.8%. Our income tax expense of $53 million consists of this $27 million, plus the $26 million of taxes paid by the operating company. Turning to the balance sheet with $9.4 billion in consolidated equity at March 31, 2021. We're well capitalized from a regulatory standpoint. We deploy our strong capital base toward opportunities to grow our business and investing opportunities worldwide as well as to emphasize the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners. Our capital is deployed across 14 registered broker-dealer type entities around the world, supporting regulatory capital requirements, liquidity needs, margin lending and other financing opportunities in our growing brokerage business. And we continue to carry no long-term debt. With that, I'll turn it over to the moderator, and we will take questions. Well, there's definitely an impact from the exchange rebates as I mentioned. But again, most of that is passed through to the customers in the form of reduced commissions. So, you'll see it come out of the expense line, but also the revenue line. One of the things we've been able to do over time or certainly over the last year is improve our software to \u2013 our routing software to optimize the routing of orders to maximize the rebates that we can then pass-through to our customers. And we're constantly looking at improving all of those systems in that regard. So \u2013 but to the bottom line, it might have a small impact, but because we're passing them through to our customers, the biggest impact is a better deal for the customer. So, Rich, the \u2013 yeah, sure. The \u2013 what it boils down to is we have all these different regulatory jurisdictions and each one has a different set of rules, so some are more flexible than others. In the U.S. when you see that our customers put in more money, deposit more money with us, much of that money will be available to lend to other customers who are borrowing money secured by their marginal stock, but in other jurisdictions, that's not the case. One has to separate and customer money in the bank and then finance the margin lending. So you can't infer from increased credit balances that they are available to fund increased financing and so that put certain constraints on us. And as we grow greatly in our non-U.S. affiliate, we had some commensurate need, growing need to have more of our own capital and then and on top \u2013 and that's on top of having to maintain a certain amount of regulatory net capital, which we do and we keep excess for all of the \u2013 all the right reason. But it's fragmented and it's devoted to these things which are opportunity. So as Thomas says, as he said before, rather than dividending it out, we're more likely to keep it and in fact, try to try to expand on it. Sure. We certainly have the capacity to utilize it, yeah. Nothing specific. We always try to point out when we have unusual expenses that we don't expect to recur like we did this time around. And G&A in general as Thomas said, we've been expanding on advertising and marketing. Otherwise, there is \u2013 if you take out the unusual item that's probably around the right run rate and your unusual items was about $19 million. Well, as you say, we prefer to increase the float rather than reduce it, given that it's only 21.8%. So you're talking about the... Sequentially? Well, the margin loan balances were up 22% from the prior quarter. It's about 157 now, with fed funds around 7 basis points."

            "name": "Thomas Peterffy",
            "content": "Yes, thank you. We are not looking at raising the dividend. We are still, as you heard Paul say, we have 14 entities, broker-dealers around the world, and we need more capital actually than we have. So \u2013 and we also have some opportunities as far as IPOs are concerned that need capital to be able to finance the subscriptions. So, it is \u2013 it's not \u2013 there is no \u2013 not going to be a dividend increase into the near future. So, another thing I need to add here is we are placing emphasis, great deal of emphasis on trying to execute match orders in our dark pools because that is the way we can provide best execution when we \u2013 now that we have 3.3 million trades a day, it is becoming lucrative. Our dark pool becomes a lucrative place for institutional traders to try to participate in interacting with that order flow. So, if we can get more and more institutional traders into our dark pool to indicate their non-urgent orders and that we can match them up with the retail flow as it come [indiscernible] in, everybody benefits, and we don't have an execution cost. It's approaching 30%. We have new hires on the one hand. And also, yes, we are looking at more regional marketing around the world. It is very initial phases, it's in infancy, it's in infancy still, but we are going to try to have a more regionalized marketing effort because we find that people are more comfortable, for example, in their native language around the \u2013 et cetera. That's correct. I mean, our marketing expenses currently are around $40 million to $50 million a year. I think it was a spokeswoman. And actually, it's \u2013 we do not disclose these things. So, as you know, whenever we come up with something, we're very likely to be followed by all of our peers. So, we like to have our cards close to or chest until we're ready to play. Well, I'm happy to answer that, if I may. You see \u2013 this is a revenue source that is very slightly, and it has to do with whether you have a substantial quantity of any stock that is difficult to borrow, and therefore commands a higher rate. Now, it just so happened that there was one and maybe a couple of other issues that had a high lending rate, and we had happened to have a great deal of it, so that's the reason for that. Yes, yes. Yes, that is correct. But first of all, don't forget that 57,000 of these new accounts came from the Folio acquisition from Goldman, right? And they tend to be small accounts and very inactive accounts, so as far as those accounts are concerned, we are not expecting any growth. Now, it is generally true that when somebody opens an account with us, initially, they put in a little bit of money and gradually over the next year or two, it increases and yes, that is correct. So to the extent that we have a sharper increase in new accounts, we can expect some follow-on funding on those accounts. That's right. Yes, I've great \u2013 I have a great idea for you. Talk to our CFO. Well, it all \u2013 it depends on how many more offices we are going to open up and how strongly the customer base and the margin borrowings grow in areas, where we are unable to use our customers' deposits. And so it's \u2013 I don't have a crystal ball. I think we could very easily use $12 billion at this moment, is that roughly right, Paul? Yeah. We will, we will. But \u2013 so our historical \u2013 if I look at our annual report, our five-year account growth rate is 27%. So yeah, I mean, 30% expectation would be quite reasonable. I just think that a lot of the people who are ready to open account, who are thinking about opening their account or open the account at the time when they had to stay at home and they had nothing to do, they finally got around to it. So we had a potential group of \u2013 a large group of people who are potentially adding and they've all done it. So I think that now, there is a smaller group that we can await for them to open their account. Eventually, that will even out and we'll be back to the historical average. I do not see why going forward, there would be a \u2013 other than our enhanced marketing effort, which is, of course, right. But otherwise, I don't see why there would be a much larger appetite for accounts than there used to be. So I \u2013 well the numbers I'm seeing, and of course, I look at shorter-term numbers. I see margin loans expanding at the healthy rate than \u2013 so I don't see the way you see. You must have looked at some very long-term numbers, right? So as I often say, it's the most frustrating area for me, I do not understand why it is that we offer the lowest margin rate in the world, and we don't have all the margin loans. But it is what it is. So I'm somewhat stunned. Sorry. Thanks. Right. So no, the slowdown is the fastest in China and Hong Kong. It must have something to do with the Chinese government cracking down on banks that send out money. So our customers find it difficult to fund accounts. And our China and Hong Kong used to be our fastest growing region. And it suddenly has become practically our slowest growing region. So yes, the answer is that's where the greatest change has occurred. Otherwise, the \u2013 maybe the fastest growth lately has been from the Middle East. Currently stated. Hello? Your voice... Yes. Please. I don't have any, so it's on that, Paul? No, they are similar. So average age of our client is 43 years old. In the United States, it's 49 years old. So other parts of the world, it's more like 40 or 39, which then averages out to 43 and that's been fairly steady. So with our new accounts beyond there, I don't think so, because the 43 has been stable for a long time. So why would that entice us to payout more? Well, you're kind of saying we would try to reach on a less in order to... No, we certainly cannot do that because you see we have a very small float, right? So \u2013 and given the tax circumstance we are in, we cannot buy back our shares, is that helpful? All right. No, we don't want to... Yes, and they come in smaller bites. It is coming in smaller bite, so they pay a higher rate, because the margin \u2013 our marginal rates vary from 75 basis points to what, 140 something? So look, I mean, we have the lowest margin rates. We don't see them being managed even though I understand why they don't. Look, you see, they are not matching them because they \u2013 people don't \u2013 the customer don't seem to pay any attention to the margin rates it seems. So they wouldn't want to cut the branch they are sitting on by lowering margins, right? Because it's \u2013 they are lending money at 6%, 7%, 8% and that's incredibly lucrative, so what they do, do is they negotiate if somebody calls. If somebody calls, so we go and get customers where we say look, why don't you come over, we have a huge margin balance and you are \u2013 let's say Ameritrade and you are paying this crazy rate and then they say, okay, okay, we will come over and two weeks later, they tell us, you know what, we called them and we told them and they said, okay, and they gave us a much, much lower rate almost matching yours. So we are not coming. So that's the story. In other words, they will not \u2013 caught the headline rates, but they will negotiate. I looked at it, but I don't know exactly. I'm sorry. 30%. Hello? 30%, right. I think about this all the time, so it's not I \u2013 even though I answered quickly, it's a very go through answer. Yes \u2013 no, I didn't say that. Something like 28% or something. I don't know where it was a year ago. I started to pay attention to this just relatively recently and I know that it has grown. I don't know what it was, but we are placing more and more emphasis on that. We see a big opportunity there. All right."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Director of Investor Relations, Nancy Stuebe. Please go ahead.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you. Good afternoon, happy new year, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Thomas is on the call, and asked me to present his comments on the business. Also joining us today are Milan Galik, our CEO, and Paul Brody, our CFO. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A. As a reminder, today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company\u2019s belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company\u2019s control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. The good news about 2022 can be seen in our numbers. We now have over 2 million customers around the world. We earned $3 billion in net revenues for the first time. In the fourth quarter, our pretax margin reached 71% \u2013 by far the highest in the industry. After two years of unprecedented investor interest in the markets overall, we now see some retrenchment and more localized engagement in particular product segments, like futures and options, rather than across the board. Rising inflation and interest rates \u2013 as well as geopolitical uncertainty in places around the globe \u2013 helped commodity, interest rate and stock index futures become more popular, while options were increasingly used to manage risk. Equity markets grew weaker as inflation and the impact of central bank policies took hold. After years of persistent deficit spending, with zero [and negative] interest rate policies around the world, I believe inflation is going to stay with us. It is likely to stay above 4%, and the Federal Reserve will keep rates at this level or higher, and eventually will have to give up on getting inflation down to its current 2% target. We believe that the target will be raised. Higher inflation and lower equities markets impacted our industry. For us, our year-on-year account growth was 25% in 2022. While for many companies this would be good news, we want to do better. Our \u201cnatural\u201d account growth, by word of mouth, is 10-20%: when markets go down, as they are now, that growth is closer to 10%; when the market goes up, that growth is more like 20%. Our sales efforts also add another 10 to 20% on top of that, though in the short-term, that growth can be very \u201clumpy\u201d. We still see the bulk of the onboarding of the two new introducing broker clients we have mentioned happening in the second and third quarters of this year. There is a lot of discussion today around market structure, and Interactive Brokers\u2019 auction model for options offers customers a path to best execution. In a volatile market, options have continued to be a security of choice for investors, both to take on exposure to a security at a lower cost than buying the stock outright, and as a way to mitigate risk. Industry-listed U.S. options\u2019 average daily volume was over 41 million contracts in 2022, up from under 40 million the prior year. We do not accept payment for order flow for IBKR Pro customer orders. Rather, we invite pegged to the mid-price orders by institutions and market-makers to our ATS to trade with our retail orders. Somewhat similarly, we auction off each option order among 22 top market makers and other professional traders, who give their best bids and offers for every order our customers enter. These auctions last something on the order of 100 milliseconds, and the winner chooses which exchange it wants to use to trade with the order. We then post the order for a second auction at the exchange, and if nobody improves on the price, the original winner of the auction trades the contract at the previously agreed upon price. This all happens in a fraction of a second. All participants use automated processes, and they automatically feed the amount of price improvement they are interested in competing on for any specific option contract, at that specific time, to trade with. This competition to win the auction means our customers can take advantage of a leading-edge system designed to get them the best available price. We are now going to enhance this system by enabling our own customers, who are so inclined, to participate in this process on the market-maker side. We are going to give them an order type with which they can signify the option or options they want to buy or sell, and when we receive an opposing order, we will bid or offer on their behalf along with the market-makers. They will also tell us the price relative to the floating mid-price, the middle of the bid/offer spread, that they are willing to pay up to and our software will do the bidding for them. We still have some minor details we must work out with this project but we are hoping to be able to introduce this capability to our customers by the end of this month. We are at the cutting edge of this best execution through auction process. We were the largest market makers in options for over 30 years, so we are very well-versed in these processes, and we have been keeping them up to date over the years. With the potential for a new regulatory process, in addition to new exchanges and continuously evolving new rules, we have a team of programmers regularly engaged in this activity. If some similar method becomes required, sophisticated mechanisms like the ones we use, could take a long time \u2013 and great expense \u2013 for others to create. There is a lot of debate on this, but we will be good with whatever ends up being the outcome. By the way, we are always happy to welcome more market makers to our platform \u2013 we added another 4 this past year \u2013 so please get in touch if you\u2019d like to join us. We introduced more new products and expanded the capabilities of existing ones. Recognizing our global customer reach, we introduced GlobalTrader, a streamlined version of our platform for mobile devices, which allows our clients to trade in over 90 stock markets worldwide. We continue to enhance our options trading tools, from mobile options trading to our rollover options tool, Strategy Builder, and Probability Lab. We will be upgrading our platform with more features and capabilities. We are introducing new tools for financial advisors, ones they have been asking for and that will set our offering apart as best in its class, as well as being among the lowest cost for an advisor to use. We are also adding new countries where our clients can trade. We were pleased to receive our bank license in Hungary, and plan to make it operational in 2023. Unlike in the US, customer funds on deposit with an EU broker, may not be used to finance margin borrowings by other customers of the broker. Only banks can lend their customers\u2019 funds to other customers, no matter what kind of collateral is involved. Our primary purpose with this EU bank is to facilitate such financing. There is much to look forward to. The Interactive Brokers platform is built with the purpose of bringing investors and marketplaces together all over the world, optimizing the allocation of capital and resources. It is our job to develop the best tools and capabilities to facilitate that. We are as busy programming as we\u2019ve ever been. This, and our much lower cost structure, is what sets up apart, and will continue to do so in the years ahead. Paul?\nPaul Brody: Thank you, Nancy. Welcome, everyone, to the call. I\u2019ll review our fourth quarter results, and then will open it up for questions. Starting with our Revenue items on page 3 of the release, we are pleased with the record financial results we achieved this quarter. Commissions rose versus last year, despite declining global market indices, reaching $331 million, our third-highest quarter ever. For the full year, commissions were $1.3 billion, down only slightly from 2021\u2019s \u201cmeme stock\u201d spike in trading. We saw higher trading volumes in futures and options in 2022, coming from our large base of sophisticated and active traders, investors and advisors. Net interest income of $565 million for the quarter and $1.7 billion for the year reflected increases in benchmark rates worldwide. US rates have moved from an average effective rate of 0.08% in the 4th quarter of 2021, to 3.65% in the 4th quarter of 2022. This led to higher interest earned on margin loans and our segregated cash portfolio. These were partially offset by the higher interest paid to our customers on their cash balances, as Interactive Brokers passes through to them all rate hikes above the first 50 basis points on their qualified funds. Other fees and services generated $43 million for the quarter and $184 million for the year. The drop from the prior year quarter was driven primarily by the risk-off positioning of customers, which led to a reduction in risk exposure fees from $18 million to $6 million. FDIC sweeps fees rose to $3 million this quarter, while market data fees of $18 million and exchange liquidity payments of $9 million were both off 10%. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings. Without these excluded items, Other income was $19 million for the quarter and $39 million for the year. Turning to expenses, Execution, Clearing and Distribution costs were $90 million in the quarter, and $324 million for the year. The increases were led by lower liquidity rebates; a nonrecurrence of 2021\u2019s options fee reductions and \u201cfee holidays\u201d from unusually high volumes throughout the industry; higher futures volumes, which carry higher fees; and an increase in the SEC fee rate on US stocks and options. As a percent of commission revenues, Execution & Clearing costs were 21% in the fourth quarter. Note that we report Market Data expense, a pass-through item, in \u201cExecution, Clearing & Distribution Fees\u201d, while the corresponding revenue item, Market Data revenue, is included in \u201cOther fees and services\u201d. To align the volume-based costs with commissions, we look at Execution & Clearing costs ex-market data expense. Compensation & Benefits expense was $119 million for the quarter, for a ratio of Compensation expense to Adjusted Net Revenues of 12%. For the year, this ratio was 14%, unchanged from last year despite a 10% increase in headcount. We continue to focus on expense discipline while improving our strong top line. Our headcount at year-end was 2,820. G&A expenses were up from the year-ago quarter, primarily on higher legal expenses from relatively low numbers last year; though for the full year they were down 6%, reflecting the non-recurrence of Brexit-related costs and a reduction in consulting expenses and bank fees. Our pretax margin was a record 71%. Automation and expense control, along with prudent management of our balance sheet, remain our key means of maintaining high margins, while we continue to hire talented people and invest in the future of our business. Income Taxes of $56 million reflects the sum of the public company\u2019s $31 million and the operating companies\u2019 $25 million. For the year, taxes of $156 million are the sum of the public company\u2019s $87 million and the operating companies\u2019 $69 million. Moving to the balance sheet on page 5 of the Release, our total assets ended the year at $115 billion, with growth driven by higher customer cash balances, partially offset by lower customer margin lending. We maintain a balance sheet geared towards supporting our growing business and providing sufficient financial resources during volatile markets. We have no long-term debt. Our ample capital base is not only deployed in running our current business, it helps us win new business, by showing the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners; and it positions us to capture numerous growth and investment opportunities we see worldwide. In our operating data, on pages 6 and 7, our contract volumes for all customers rose 23% over the prior-year quarter in futures, well above industry growth. Options contract and stock share volumes declined versus unusually high volumes last year. For the full year, options and futures contract volumes rose 3% and 33%, respectively. The decrease in Stock share volume was largely attributable to lower trading in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks. On page 7, you can see that: Account growth remains robust, with 415 thousand net new account adds for the year. Total accounts broke through the 2 million mark in 2022, closing the year at 2.1 million, up 25% over the prior year. Total Customer DARTs were 1.9 million trades per day, reflecting a risk-off period for investors and down from last year\u2019s stronger market environment. Commission per Cleared Commissionable Order of $3.15 was up 32% from last year, as our clients\u2019 volume mix included fewer low-priced stock trades and larger average trade size in options. Page 8 shows our Net Interest Margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income was $565 million for the quarter, up 92%, and $1.7 billion for the year, up 45%. These reflected strength in margin loan and segregated cash interest, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates twice in the quarter, by 75 basis points in November, and a further 50 basis points in mid-December. These increases had a partial positive impact in a 12-week quarter, but will have a full impact in the first quarter of 2023. Other central banks also raised rates this quarter, including the UK, Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, the Eurozone and Switzerland. Higher interest rates led to margin loan interest income up 32% over the third quarter and 182% over the prior-year quarter, more than compensating for lower average balances in both periods. Securities lending net interest was not as strong as in the prior year for a few reasons. First, while overall customer demand for shorting stocks and borrowing shares rose, there were fewer \u201chard to borrow\u201d names throughout the industry. Second, benchmark rates are rising. The interest we earn on cash collateral received in exchange for lending stocks is also rising. That\u2019s good news. Because this cash collateral is invested as segregated funds, the interest earned on it falls under the heading \u201cNet interest income on Segregated Cash\u201d in our NIM table, rather than \u201cSecurities Borrowed and Loaned\u201d. We estimate that the incremental interest earned on this stock loan cash collateral from rate increases was $42 million for the quarter. Interest on Customer Credit Balances, or the interest we pay to our customers, increased. Higher rates in nearly all currencies led to our paying interest on qualifying balances as we pass through these rate increases to our customers. We paid $487 million to our customers on these balances in the fourth quarter, and a total of $763 million for the year. Fully rate-sensitive balances were about $20 billion this quarter. Now, for our estimates of the impact of increases in rates. Given market expectations of more rate hikes to come, we estimate the effects of increases in the Fed Funds rate to produce additional annual net interest income as follows: At 25 basis points, an increase of $49 million; at 50 basis points, an increase of $97 million; at 75 basis points, an increase of $146 million; and at 100 basis points, an increase of $195 million. Note that our starting point for these estimates is December 31st, with the Fed Funds effective rate at 4.33%, and our balances at that date. About 25% of our customer segregated cash is not in US dollars, so estimates of US rate change impacts exclude those currencies. We estimate a 25-basis point increase in all the relevant non-USD benchmark rates would produce additional annual net interest income of $25 million, and rising to about $100 million at a 100 basis point rate increase. In conclusion, we had a financially strong quarter to close out a record year in net revenues and pretax margin, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base and deliver on our core value proposition to customers. We have done this while highlighting the attractiveness of our strategy to automate for growth: expanding what we offer while minimizing what we charge. We do this at low cost, managing our growing business effectively and with strong expense control. With that, we will turn it over to the moderator and will now take some questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Richard Repetto of Piper Sandler.\nRichard Repetto: I guess my question, Thomas had to do with the introduction and how you talked about Interactive Brokers technology being so adept, I guess, in the options auctions. And I guess the question is, okay, it looks like we could have auctions implemented into equities. And could you just talk about if there\u2019s any first impressions of what the SEC has rolled out? And what do you think is the impact? And would you have that same\u2014 I guess you\u2019re saying you have that same advantage of the experience of the auctions from options and can apply it to equities. Is that what the message was?\nThomas Peterffy: Yes. So, I haven\u2019t heard anything, and I do not expect that the SEC will require an auction process for options. But to the extent that they will do so for securities, I think that gives us a great leg up in marketing our auction process for options because obviously, if auctions are good for securities, they are good for options, too. As a matter of fact, the fact is that it is better for options\u2014 because on options, the bid-offer spread is relatively wider than it is in securities. So, a $3 option that really costs, say, $300 for a contract, the bid-offer spread is often as wide as $0.05 to $0.06 or $5 to $6 on a $300 trade, right? So, a facility whereby the participants can meetsomewhere in the middle and the spread is saved to our two customers on each side of the trade, I think it\u2019s a huge leg up and we can market the hell out of it. That\u2019s the idea here.\nRichard Repetto: I guess just a quick follow-up on that, but you don\u2019t consider the options price improvement sort of\u2014 I thought those were called auctions, but you don\u2019t consider them equivalent to what the SEC has sort of outlined at this point?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, it is equivalent in the stock space, but I haven\u2019t heard them talking about options. But we are basically proposing to do the same thing in options as they may require for stocks.\nRichard Repetto: Okay. And one other financial analysis question. Paul, can you give us sort of expectations for expenses in the coming year? It looks like the adjusted\u2014I think if our number is right, somewhere about 15% year-over-year increase in expenses this year. Is that a good number to sort of use as a benchmark or rule of thumb for 2023?\nPaul Brody: Thomas, you have a view? Maybe we have been doing...\nThomas Peterffy: I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t catch the question.\nPaul Brody: The increase in overall expenses. I mean, we do continue to hire along with the growth in our business.\nThomas Peterffy: Yeah, I think our increase\u2014 I think we\u2019re going to increase expenses roughly 15% a year as we have done in the past. We continue to grow. We continue to come up with new things, and we continue to pay to attract new talent. But as long as our expenses don\u2019t increase any higher than our revenues, I think we\u2019re going to continue to run at around 70% profit margin, and that\u2019s good enough for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So, if we exclude the two large introducing broker wins that are going to start funding in 2Q, how does the future i-broker pipeline look? And could you announce additional large i-broker wins over the course of the next year?\nThomas Peterffy: Could we\u2014sure, we could. The question is will we, and I am not so sure we will. I mean, obviously, we have a lot of people out there who are trying to recruit i-brokers and the more we get on the platform, the more they will hear about it and the more of them will come to us. The idea basically is that worldwide, it is very difficult to create a system that is compliant with all the regulations all over the world. And so we have a huge leg up in having done so, and I think we don\u2019t have any\u2014 basically, I don\u2019t think we have any serious competitors in this space.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Got it, Thomas. And then just for my follow-up, I heard Paul\u2019s comments on higher legal expenses in G&A. Should we assume part of that as onetime as we work\u2026.? And I\u2019m just thinking, is there a good number for us to work off for 1Q \u201823 relative to the $48 million in 4Q?\nPaul Brody: Legal expenses get\u2014 they go up, they go down, cases come by, regulatory things come by. Maybe the best\u2014 the most realistic thing you could look at is on the year as opposed to on the quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish of Barclays.\nBenjamin Budish: I kind of wanted to follow up on the spending, but maybe kind of a higher-level question. Can you maybe talk about some of your strategic priorities for this year? I think in the past, you\u2019ve kind of indicated the more geographic expansion, digging deeper into the hedge fund business. Where are you kind of focused in terms of spending, your top priorities?\nMilan Galik: Thanks for the question. We are focusing on making our systems more robust. The more i-brokers we get on the platform, some of them being large multinational banks, they require a very high level of reliability and redundancy. We have had back up data centers, online, available to us for a long time, but we are not able to turn them on in a matter of seconds or minutes. So that is where significant expenditure is going to go. As far as growing the staff, we\u2019re going to be flexible in the area of compliance and customer service, and we will respond to the increase in the number of accounts and the trading activity. As far as the technology is concerned, we will continue hiring the talent as we have in the past.\nBenjamin Budish: Great. Super helpful. And then if I could follow up on kind of a comment you guys made earlier on \u2013 I know you said that the account growth, there\u2019s kind of a mix between natural word of mouth and sales, which can be quite lumpy. I\u2019m just wondering kind of in the most recent months, what has been the mix. Has it been sort of even or more geared one way or another?\nThomas Peterffy: It\u2019s half and half, roughly.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Fannon of Jefferies.\nDaniel Fannon: Thomas, I wanted to get your thoughts on just the elevated use of options as well as futures and maybe the sustainability of that as you think about 2023 and whether we\u2019re above average, below or you think we can still grow from here?\nThomas Peterffy: So, as you know, I started my career in this business as an options trader on the floor of the AMEX, and all I have seen over the past 46 years is a continuous increase in options trading. And what we see now is in addition to the U.S. growth, growth is now beginning to pick up in Asia and in Europe in the options space because they basically got into the options business about 20 or 30 years ago and then it slowly dwindled down to nothing over there. And now it is finally picking up again. So, I am extremely optimistic about the growth in options trading. Obviously, if you just look at the idea of doing vertical spreads, when your losses are very limited, and you can put on some terrific positions in vertical spreads, it\u2019s much better than trading stocks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt of KBW.\nKyle Voigt: Good evening. Maybe just a follow-up on the commentary earlier regarding the sales effort adding 10% to 20% to account growth per year. I\u2019m just wondering is that, with the current sales team and marketing budget and when we think about that 15% expense growth, is sales and marketing an area you\u2019re prioritizing? I\u2019m just wondering like, bigger picture, are there larger changes in advertising strategy that you\u2019re contemplating, I guess, as you look out to next year?\nThomas Peterffy: So, we\u2019re working this across the board. We\u2019re continuously trying to train new salespeople who basically come to begin working on our professional help desk. And after they went through that for about 2 or 3 years, they are mature enough to bring onto the sales team and begin to sell. As far as advertising, as you know, it\u2019s the digital advertising space, it\u2019s a situation in flux to the extent that I am in a flux trying to talk about it. So basically, what I\u2019m saying is reflecting what\u2019s going on there and the way I say it. So, we\u2019re continuously working on it, and we do not have budget constraints anywhere, but we are trying to get a good return on the investment. So, we are not going to throw a lot of money on various campaigns unless we see that it proves itself. So, we try small and if it works, we keep trying to get it bigger and bigger and bigger. But usually, as we find it \u2013 when we start something, it starts working, and as we keep growing, it works less and less. I don\u2019t know why that is so, but that\u2019s how it is. So, we have a lot more, we would love to spend a lot more money advertising, but we won\u2019t do it without having a reasonable return.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. Maybe I shift over to NII. Just curious, strategically speaking, if we start to see the central banks cut overnight rates potentially by later this year, does that change your strategy on the duration of the segregated cash portfolio at all?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, if you believe that they will cut it, good luck to you.\nKyle Voigt: I guess if we do start to see that move, I guess, does that change your viewpoint or is what you said earlier?\nThomas Peterffy: It is a risk we cannot take because if you\u2019re right, we\u2019ll actually make extra money. But if we\u2019re wrong, we can lose a fortune because as rates go up, we have to raise the rate that we pay to our clients. And we don\u2019t want to be a situation where we are lent out on the long end and we\u2019re borrowing on the short term from our customers. So, we can get creamed that way, and we will not do that.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. And last question for me. It\u2019s just the yield on customer credit balances that you\u2019re paying out the clients came in a bit lower than we expected. Paul, I know you said $20 billion is the fully rate-sensitive cash figure. I just want to confirm that $20 billion figure, does that also include balances that are partially rate sensitive within there? I just wanted to confirm that.\nPaul Brody: Right. I mean it includes the equivalent of the fully sensitive balance, right? So, we pay a pro rata portion of our full rate on accounts that have between $10,000 and $100,000 in equity. We\u2019ve calculated the equivalent effective principal on which the full rate would have been paid right? So, it\u2019s a good number to assume they\u2019re fully sensitive.\nKyle Voigt: Yes. And the interest rate sensitivity that you gave earlier, Paul, I just want to confirm as well, that does not include, I\u2019m assuming, the additional interest that you\u2019d also earn on corporate cash balances. Is that correct?\nPaul Brody: No, it does assume that both the customer side and the investment side move together, right? And we have quite a short duration. And so those are fully absorbed run rates, but it wouldn\u2019t take us that long to get there as rates move around given that our duration is short.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen of Citi.\nChris Allen: I was wondering if maybe you could give some color just in terms of the account growth \u2013 were there any strength in any particular customer segments or regions relative to any others this quarter?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, look, our fastest account growth is individuals, followed by prop traders, followed by hedge funds, followed by i-brokers, and lastly, financial advisers. So that\u2019s the relative rate of growth. And that is for the last 12 months, so I have not broken this out for the last quarter. But\u2014 so look, basically, probably the last quarter, hedge fund growth is probably\u2014 yes, that is unusually high. And we don\u2019t do as well with financial advisers as we do with hedge funds. The software development that Milan mentioned having to do with financial advisers is meant to better that growth rate.\nChris Allen: Got it. Any specific regions growing faster than others at the moment?\nThomas Peterffy: Yes, I think it\u2019s to a large extent, this is a word-of-mouth game, right? And it just so happens that we are doing very well among hedge fund people, and financial advisers are more or less locked up to the extent that they are associated with Morgan Stanley and UBS, they are locked up there. To the extent they are independent, they are with Schwab and Ameritrade. And so, they are not as easily\u2014 and there are not so many new of them that start, right? So, it is a more difficult task to get new financial advisers than it is to get hedge funds.\nChris Allen: Got it. And is there any way you guys can frame out the Hungary bank license, what that might mean just in terms of the inability to fund margin loans in Europe, EU right now, what the demand would theoretically be\u2014 any way to think about that?\nThomas Peterffy: Margin accounts, currently, we cannot use customer monies to lend out to other customers in the EU, and we have roughly a similar demand in the EU as we have in the U.S. for that. And so, we are currently using our own money. In the future, we will be able to use other customers\u2019 money.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Richard Repetto of Piper Sandler.\nRichard Repetto: Yes, sorry. First, just a couple of quick accounting follow-ups. Paul, you said that -- I thought you said that the market data expense went into execution and clearing. I didn\u2019t get the number. Can you give us the amount that went into the execution and clearing expense?\nPaul Brody: Right. So, the line item is called \u201cexecution, clearing and distribution\u201d, where the distribution is really distribution of market data. What I was pointing out is that when we talk about the expense portion of executing a trade about 21% cost versus the commission that we earned. And in order to get a reasonable number there, an accurate number, you have to pull out from the line item, market data, which doesn\u2019t go into commission, it goes into the Other income line. That\u2019s how it\u2019s paired up, right? It\u2019s marginally profitable every year because there\u2019s a little bit of markup and some estimates on how we have to estimate our costs and pass through. But in other words, what I was pointing out is to get rid of the noise when you\u2019re thinking about the marginal gross profit that we get when we execute a trade and earn a commission.\nRichard Repetto: Okay. And was there any one timers this quarter in G&A expenses?\nPaul Brody: Not especially other than, as I said, legal fees go up and down. They were up a bit higher this year, but they were especially low last year. So, it\u2019s\u2014 as I said, nothing else of note and it\u2019s better to look at probably the whole year to understand something more about our run rate.\nRichard Repetto: Okay. And then the last question is I believe the sensitivity, the interest rate sensitivity for the 25-basis point rate hike is smaller than it was what you said it was last quarter. I believe it was $54, going down to $49. If I do have that correct, can -- I know margin balances are down, but is that just the prime culprit because seg cash balances are up and -- I\u2019m just trying to get why is it down.\nPaul Brody: Right. So, there\u2019s a few different scenarios that we talk about. If we assume that all currencies, understand it\u2019s a hypothetical case. If all currencies raised rates together, the numbers are actually up from last quarter, the projected numbers are up. When we assume that the USD only\u2014only the Fed funds will increase, and other currencies will not, what happens is that there\u2019s an overlay of currency swaps because in order to protect customer money for the U.S. customers when we receive other currencies, we swap them into U.S. dollars and put them into segregation, and there\u2019s a cost to that. And when the USD rates go up, that cost goes up. And so, as you project out a higher interest rate increase only in the U.S. dollars, there is some offsetting effect that would tend to dampen the incremental number at any given increase\u2014 25 basis points, 100 basis points.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Macrae Sykes of GAMCO.\nMacrae Sykes: Congratulations on the quarter and the year, very strong progress. My question is around providing an update on your efforts to attract larger institutional customers to interact with your order flow. And I was wondering if some of the talk about the changes in potential market structure, is that helping to drive some further discussions with other clients as well.\nMilan Galik: Yes, we continue to attract institutional traders into our ATS. They have at their disposal\u2014 they have a number of order types they can trade against the client flow that we have. They can use peg to mid orders, they can use pegged best orders. We will continue the effort to get more onto the platform. We are approaching various algorithmic trading firms and algo providers. We believe that they would enjoy the quality of the flow that they get to interact with. As far as the upcoming changes that the SEC announced \u2013 to put them into perspective, the comment time period ends at the end of March. There are going to be a lot of industry participants responding to the proposals, we will submit our own comment letter. After that, it\u2019s going to be decided what will finally get accepted and adopted, and I think it is going to take approximately 2 years for any change to take place. Now as to what exactly is going to happen in the area of auctions, it somewhat depends, because the details were not really specified. What we do know is that some percentage of the retail flow will have to be exposed into the exchange auctions. This is typically a flow of clients that trade around 240 times in 6 months. So, these are not frequently-trading accounts, and their flow is going to be subject to auctions. But there is a way around that. If a broker holding this order does not want the order to go into an auction, he can fill it at the mid-price, at the mid-price that he can find somewhere at an open market, or at an ATS or in a dark pool, or he can fill it against his own inventory. Now, exactly what the limitations are going to be is unclear. The SEC may have a preference for a very large portion of these orders to go into the auctions, and limit the number of orders that the brokers can fill outside of the auctions. We don\u2019t know the details. And I think all this is going to be cleared up after the industry has time and opportunity to respond, and the SEC carefully evaluates the responses.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Nancy Stuebe for closing remarks.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will talk to you next quarter end.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, happy new year, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Thomas is on the call, and asked me to present his comments on the business. Also joining us today are Milan Galik, our CEO, and Paul Brody, our CFO. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. The good news about 2022 can be seen in our numbers. We now have over 2 million customers around the world. We earned $3 billion in net revenues for the first time. In the fourth quarter, our pretax margin reached 71% \u2013 by far the highest in the industry. After two years of unprecedented investor interest in the markets overall, we now see some retrenchment and more localized engagement in particular product segments, like futures and options, rather than across the board. Rising inflation and interest rates \u2013 as well as geopolitical uncertainty in places around the globe \u2013 helped commodity, interest rate and stock index futures become more popular, while options were increasingly used to manage risk. Equity markets grew weaker as inflation and the impact of central bank policies took hold. After years of persistent deficit spending, with zero [and negative] interest rate policies around the world, I believe inflation is going to stay with us. It is likely to stay above 4%, and the Federal Reserve will keep rates at this level or higher, and eventually will have to give up on getting inflation down to its current 2% target. We believe that the target will be raised. Higher inflation and lower equities markets impacted our industry. For us, our year-on-year account growth was 25% in 2022. While for many companies this would be good news, we want to do better. Our \u201cnatural\u201d account growth, by word of mouth, is 10-20%: when markets go down, as they are now, that growth is closer to 10%; when the market goes up, that growth is more like 20%. Our sales efforts also add another 10 to 20% on top of that, though in the short-term, that growth can be very \u201clumpy\u201d. We still see the bulk of the onboarding of the two new introducing broker clients we have mentioned happening in the second and third quarters of this year. There is a lot of discussion today around market structure, and Interactive Brokers' auction model for options offers customers a path to best execution. In a volatile market, options have continued to be a security of choice for investors, both to take on exposure to a security at a lower cost than buying the stock outright, and as a way to mitigate risk. Industry-listed U.S. options' average daily volume was over 41 million contracts in 2022, up from under 40 million the prior year. We do not accept payment for order flow for IBKR Pro customer orders. Rather, we invite pegged to the mid-price orders by institutions and market-makers to our ATS to trade with our retail orders. Somewhat similarly, we auction off each option order among 22 top market makers and other professional traders, who give their best bids and offers for every order our customers enter. These auctions last something on the order of 100 milliseconds, and the winner chooses which exchange it wants to use to trade with the order. We then post the order for a second auction at the exchange, and if nobody improves on the price, the original winner of the auction trades the contract at the previously agreed upon price. This all happens in a fraction of a second. All participants use automated processes, and they automatically feed the amount of price improvement they are interested in competing on for any specific option contract, at that specific time, to trade with. This competition to win the auction means our customers can take advantage of a leading-edge system designed to get them the best available price. We are now going to enhance this system by enabling our own customers, who are so inclined, to participate in this process on the market-maker side. We are going to give them an order type with which they can signify the option or options they want to buy or sell, and when we receive an opposing order, we will bid or offer on their behalf along with the market-makers. They will also tell us the price relative to the floating mid-price, the middle of the bid/offer spread, that they are willing to pay up to and our software will do the bidding for them. We still have some minor details we must work out with this project but we are hoping to be able to introduce this capability to our customers by the end of this month. We are at the cutting edge of this best execution through auction process. We were the largest market makers in options for over 30 years, so we are very well-versed in these processes, and we have been keeping them up to date over the years. With the potential for a new regulatory process, in addition to new exchanges and continuously evolving new rules, we have a team of programmers regularly engaged in this activity. If some similar method becomes required, sophisticated mechanisms like the ones we use, could take a long time \u2013 and great expense \u2013 for others to create. There is a lot of debate on this, but we will be good with whatever ends up being the outcome. By the way, we are always happy to welcome more market makers to our platform \u2013 we added another 4 this past year \u2013 so please get in touch if you'd like to join us. We introduced more new products and expanded the capabilities of existing ones. Recognizing our global customer reach, we introduced GlobalTrader, a streamlined version of our platform for mobile devices, which allows our clients to trade in over 90 stock markets worldwide. We continue to enhance our options trading tools, from mobile options trading to our rollover options tool, Strategy Builder, and Probability Lab. We will be upgrading our platform with more features and capabilities. We are introducing new tools for financial advisors, ones they have been asking for and that will set our offering apart as best in its class, as well as being among the lowest cost for an advisor to use. We are also adding new countries where our clients can trade. We were pleased to receive our bank license in Hungary, and plan to make it operational in 2023. Unlike in the US, customer funds on deposit with an EU broker, may not be used to finance margin borrowings by other customers of the broker. Only banks can lend their customers' funds to other customers, no matter what kind of collateral is involved. Our primary purpose with this EU bank is to facilitate such financing. There is much to look forward to. The Interactive Brokers platform is built with the purpose of bringing investors and marketplaces together all over the world, optimizing the allocation of capital and resources. It is our job to develop the best tools and capabilities to facilitate that. We are as busy programming as we've ever been. This, and our much lower cost structure, is what sets up apart, and will continue to do so in the years ahead. Paul? Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will talk to you next quarter end."

            "name": "Paul Brody",
            "content": "Thank you, Nancy. Welcome, everyone, to the call. I'll review our fourth quarter results, and then will open it up for questions. Starting with our Revenue items on page 3 of the release, we are pleased with the record financial results we achieved this quarter. Commissions rose versus last year, despite declining global market indices, reaching $331 million, our third-highest quarter ever. For the full year, commissions were $1.3 billion, down only slightly from 2021's \u201cmeme stock\u201d spike in trading. We saw higher trading volumes in futures and options in 2022, coming from our large base of sophisticated and active traders, investors and advisors. Net interest income of $565 million for the quarter and $1.7 billion for the year reflected increases in benchmark rates worldwide. US rates have moved from an average effective rate of 0.08% in the 4th quarter of 2021, to 3.65% in the 4th quarter of 2022. This led to higher interest earned on margin loans and our segregated cash portfolio. These were partially offset by the higher interest paid to our customers on their cash balances, as Interactive Brokers passes through to them all rate hikes above the first 50 basis points on their qualified funds. Other fees and services generated $43 million for the quarter and $184 million for the year. The drop from the prior year quarter was driven primarily by the risk-off positioning of customers, which led to a reduction in risk exposure fees from $18 million to $6 million. FDIC sweeps fees rose to $3 million this quarter, while market data fees of $18 million and exchange liquidity payments of $9 million were both off 10%. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings. Without these excluded items, Other income was $19 million for the quarter and $39 million for the year. Turning to expenses, Execution, Clearing and Distribution costs were $90 million in the quarter, and $324 million for the year. The increases were led by lower liquidity rebates; a nonrecurrence of 2021's options fee reductions and \u201cfee holidays\u201d from unusually high volumes throughout the industry; higher futures volumes, which carry higher fees; and an increase in the SEC fee rate on US stocks and options. As a percent of commission revenues, Execution & Clearing costs were 21% in the fourth quarter. Note that we report Market Data expense, a pass-through item, in \u201cExecution, Clearing & Distribution Fees\u201d, while the corresponding revenue item, Market Data revenue, is included in \u201cOther fees and services\u201d. To align the volume-based costs with commissions, we look at Execution & Clearing costs ex-market data expense. Compensation & Benefits expense was $119 million for the quarter, for a ratio of Compensation expense to Adjusted Net Revenues of 12%. For the year, this ratio was 14%, unchanged from last year despite a 10% increase in headcount. We continue to focus on expense discipline while improving our strong top line. Our headcount at year-end was 2,820. G&A expenses were up from the year-ago quarter, primarily on higher legal expenses from relatively low numbers last year; though for the full year they were down 6%, reflecting the non-recurrence of Brexit-related costs and a reduction in consulting expenses and bank fees. Our pretax margin was a record 71%. Automation and expense control, along with prudent management of our balance sheet, remain our key means of maintaining high margins, while we continue to hire talented people and invest in the future of our business. Income Taxes of $56 million reflects the sum of the public company's $31 million and the operating companies' $25 million. For the year, taxes of $156 million are the sum of the public company's $87 million and the operating companies' $69 million. Moving to the balance sheet on page 5 of the Release, our total assets ended the year at $115 billion, with growth driven by higher customer cash balances, partially offset by lower customer margin lending. We maintain a balance sheet geared towards supporting our growing business and providing sufficient financial resources during volatile markets. We have no long-term debt. Our ample capital base is not only deployed in running our current business, it helps us win new business, by showing the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners; and it positions us to capture numerous growth and investment opportunities we see worldwide. In our operating data, on pages 6 and 7, our contract volumes for all customers rose 23% over the prior-year quarter in futures, well above industry growth. Options contract and stock share volumes declined versus unusually high volumes last year. For the full year, options and futures contract volumes rose 3% and 33%, respectively. The decrease in Stock share volume was largely attributable to lower trading in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks. On page 7, you can see that: Account growth remains robust, with 415 thousand net new account adds for the year. Total accounts broke through the 2 million mark in 2022, closing the year at 2.1 million, up 25% over the prior year. Total Customer DARTs were 1.9 million trades per day, reflecting a risk-off period for investors and down from last year's stronger market environment. Commission per Cleared Commissionable Order of $3.15 was up 32% from last year, as our clients' volume mix included fewer low-priced stock trades and larger average trade size in options. Page 8 shows our Net Interest Margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income was $565 million for the quarter, up 92%, and $1.7 billion for the year, up 45%. These reflected strength in margin loan and segregated cash interest, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates twice in the quarter, by 75 basis points in November, and a further 50 basis points in mid-December. These increases had a partial positive impact in a 12-week quarter, but will have a full impact in the first quarter of 2023. Other central banks also raised rates this quarter, including the UK, Hong Kong, Canada, Australia, the Eurozone and Switzerland. Higher interest rates led to margin loan interest income up 32% over the third quarter and 182% over the prior-year quarter, more than compensating for lower average balances in both periods. Securities lending net interest was not as strong as in the prior year for a few reasons. First, while overall customer demand for shorting stocks and borrowing shares rose, there were fewer \u201chard to borrow\u201d names throughout the industry. Second, benchmark rates are rising. The interest we earn on cash collateral received in exchange for lending stocks is also rising. That's good news. Because this cash collateral is invested as segregated funds, the interest earned on it falls under the heading \u201cNet interest income on Segregated Cash\u201d in our NIM table, rather than \u201cSecurities Borrowed and Loaned\u201d. We estimate that the incremental interest earned on this stock loan cash collateral from rate increases was $42 million for the quarter. Interest on Customer Credit Balances, or the interest we pay to our customers, increased. Higher rates in nearly all currencies led to our paying interest on qualifying balances as we pass through these rate increases to our customers. We paid $487 million to our customers on these balances in the fourth quarter, and a total of $763 million for the year. Fully rate-sensitive balances were about $20 billion this quarter. Now, for our estimates of the impact of increases in rates. Given market expectations of more rate hikes to come, we estimate the effects of increases in the Fed Funds rate to produce additional annual net interest income as follows: At 25 basis points, an increase of $49 million; at 50 basis points, an increase of $97 million; at 75 basis points, an increase of $146 million; and at 100 basis points, an increase of $195 million. Note that our starting point for these estimates is December 31st, with the Fed Funds effective rate at 4.33%, and our balances at that date. About 25% of our customer segregated cash is not in US dollars, so estimates of US rate change impacts exclude those currencies. We estimate a 25-basis point increase in all the relevant non-USD benchmark rates would produce additional annual net interest income of $25 million, and rising to about $100 million at a 100 basis point rate increase. In conclusion, we had a financially strong quarter to close out a record year in net revenues and pretax margin, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base and deliver on our core value proposition to customers. We have done this while highlighting the attractiveness of our strategy to automate for growth: expanding what we offer while minimizing what we charge. We do this at low cost, managing our growing business effectively and with strong expense control. With that, we will turn it over to the moderator and will now take some questions. Thomas, you have a view? Maybe we have been doing... The increase in overall expenses. I mean, we do continue to hire along with the growth in our business. Legal expenses get\u2014 they go up, they go down, cases come by, regulatory things come by. Maybe the best\u2014 the most realistic thing you could look at is on the year as opposed to on the quarter. Right. I mean it includes the equivalent of the fully sensitive balance, right? So, we pay a pro rata portion of our full rate on accounts that have between $10,000 and $100,000 in equity. We've calculated the equivalent effective principal on which the full rate would have been paid right? So, it's a good number to assume they're fully sensitive. No, it does assume that both the customer side and the investment side move together, right? And we have quite a short duration. And so those are fully absorbed run rates, but it wouldn't take us that long to get there as rates move around given that our duration is short. Right. So, the line item is called \u201cexecution, clearing and distribution\u201d, where the distribution is really distribution of market data. What I was pointing out is that when we talk about the expense portion of executing a trade about 21% cost versus the commission that we earned. And in order to get a reasonable number there, an accurate number, you have to pull out from the line item, market data, which doesn't go into commission, it goes into the Other income line. That's how it's paired up, right? It's marginally profitable every year because there's a little bit of markup and some estimates on how we have to estimate our costs and pass through. But in other words, what I was pointing out is to get rid of the noise when you're thinking about the marginal gross profit that we get when we execute a trade and earn a commission. Not especially other than, as I said, legal fees go up and down. They were up a bit higher this year, but they were especially low last year. So, it's\u2014 as I said, nothing else of note and it's better to look at probably the whole year to understand something more about our run rate. Right. So, there's a few different scenarios that we talk about. If we assume that all currencies, understand it's a hypothetical case. If all currencies raised rates together, the numbers are actually up from last quarter, the projected numbers are up. When we assume that the USD only\u2014only the Fed funds will increase, and other currencies will not, what happens is that there's an overlay of currency swaps because in order to protect customer money for the U.S. customers when we receive other currencies, we swap them into U.S. dollars and put them into segregation, and there's a cost to that. And when the USD rates go up, that cost goes up. And so, as you project out a higher interest rate increase only in the U.S. dollars, there is some offsetting effect that would tend to dampen the incremental number at any given increase\u2014 25 basis points, 100 basis points."

            "content": "Yes. So, I haven't heard anything, and I do not expect that the SEC will require an auction process for options. But to the extent that they will do so for securities, I think that gives us a great leg up in marketing our auction process for options because obviously, if auctions are good for securities, they are good for options, too. As a matter of fact, the fact is that it is better for options\u2014 because on options, the bid-offer spread is relatively wider than it is in securities. So, a $3 option that really costs, say, $300 for a contract, the bid-offer spread is often as wide as $0.05 to $0.06 or $5 to $6 on a $300 trade, right? So, a facility whereby the participants can meetsomewhere in the middle and the spread is saved to our two customers on each side of the trade, I think it's a huge leg up and we can market the hell out of it. That's the idea here. Well, it is equivalent in the stock space, but I haven't heard them talking about options. But we are basically proposing to do the same thing in options as they may require for stocks. I'm sorry, I didn't catch the question. Yeah, I think our increase\u2014 I think we're going to increase expenses roughly 15% a year as we have done in the past. We continue to grow. We continue to come up with new things, and we continue to pay to attract new talent. But as long as our expenses don't increase any higher than our revenues, I think we're going to continue to run at around 70% profit margin, and that's good enough for us. Could we\u2014sure, we could. The question is will we, and I am not so sure we will. I mean, obviously, we have a lot of people out there who are trying to recruit i-brokers and the more we get on the platform, the more they will hear about it and the more of them will come to us. The idea basically is that worldwide, it is very difficult to create a system that is compliant with all the regulations all over the world. And so we have a huge leg up in having done so, and I think we don't have any\u2014 basically, I don't think we have any serious competitors in this space. It's half and half, roughly. So, as you know, I started my career in this business as an options trader on the floor of the AMEX, and all I have seen over the past 46 years is a continuous increase in options trading. And what we see now is in addition to the U.S. growth, growth is now beginning to pick up in Asia and in Europe in the options space because they basically got into the options business about 20 or 30 years ago and then it slowly dwindled down to nothing over there. And now it is finally picking up again. So, I am extremely optimistic about the growth in options trading. Obviously, if you just look at the idea of doing vertical spreads, when your losses are very limited, and you can put on some terrific positions in vertical spreads, it's much better than trading stocks. So, we're working this across the board. We're continuously trying to train new salespeople who basically come to begin working on our professional help desk. And after they went through that for about 2 or 3 years, they are mature enough to bring onto the sales team and begin to sell. As far as advertising, as you know, it's the digital advertising space, it's a situation in flux to the extent that I am in a flux trying to talk about it. So basically, what I'm saying is reflecting what's going on there and the way I say it. So, we're continuously working on it, and we do not have budget constraints anywhere, but we are trying to get a good return on the investment. So, we are not going to throw a lot of money on various campaigns unless we see that it proves itself. So, we try small and if it works, we keep trying to get it bigger and bigger and bigger. But usually, as we find it \u2013 when we start something, it starts working, and as we keep growing, it works less and less. I don't know why that is so, but that's how it is. So, we have a lot more, we would love to spend a lot more money advertising, but we won't do it without having a reasonable return. Well, if you believe that they will cut it, good luck to you. It is a risk we cannot take because if you're right, we'll actually make extra money. But if we're wrong, we can lose a fortune because as rates go up, we have to raise the rate that we pay to our clients. And we don't want to be a situation where we are lent out on the long end and we're borrowing on the short term from our customers. So, we can get creamed that way, and we will not do that. Well, look, our fastest account growth is individuals, followed by prop traders, followed by hedge funds, followed by i-brokers, and lastly, financial advisers. So that's the relative rate of growth. And that is for the last 12 months, so I have not broken this out for the last quarter. But\u2014 so look, basically, probably the last quarter, hedge fund growth is probably\u2014 yes, that is unusually high. And we don't do as well with financial advisers as we do with hedge funds. The software development that Milan mentioned having to do with financial advisers is meant to better that growth rate. Yes, I think it's to a large extent, this is a word-of-mouth game, right? And it just so happens that we are doing very well among hedge fund people, and financial advisers are more or less locked up to the extent that they are associated with Morgan Stanley and UBS, they are locked up there. To the extent they are independent, they are with Schwab and Ameritrade. And so, they are not as easily\u2014 and there are not so many new of them that start, right? So, it is a more difficult task to get new financial advisers than it is to get hedge funds. Margin accounts, currently, we cannot use customer monies to lend out to other customers in the EU, and we have roughly a similar demand in the EU as we have in the U.S. for that. And so, we are currently using our own money. In the future, we will be able to use other customers' money."

        "content": "Operator: Hello. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Interactive Brokers Group\u2019s Third Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Nancy Stuebe, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. Also joining us today are Milan Galik, our CEO; and Paul Brody, our CFO. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. This quarter showed the strength of the Interactive Brokers business model, automating substantial parts of the brokerage business in order to keep costs low and global product offerings and opportunities high even as unfavorable market conditions continued to extend into this quarter and beyond. While we were able to maintain our commission income just barely, it is understandable that in these mostly one way markets, only very few retail clients feel any urge to open new brokerage accounts. This has a large and unfavorable implication for the growth of our business and we expect this to continue into the early part of next year. In spite of that, by this time next year, we expect that our accounts will be about 30% higher than today due to some new larger introducing broker relationships we have mentioned earlier. Preparing to onboard these accounts is a very slow process and it is unlikely that any sign of these will show before the spring. Account number growth comes on the retail end from direct and introducing broker customers. A much of our commission income comes from hedge funds and proprietary trading groups. An average hedge fund account generates 67 times as much revenue as an average individual account, and for prop trading accounts, the small supplier is around 10 times. Hedge funds and proprietary trading accounts are less affected by the direction of the markets and are therefore our emphasis has turned more in their direction lately. As most recent prep and statistics illustrate, for the past three consecutive years, the number of hedge funds on our platform has grown faster than at any other leading banker broker. IBKR is now the sixth largest provider of prime brokerage services by number of funds, and we feel fairly confident about moving to the number four in the current year, right behind Morgan Stanley, Goldman and JPMorgan. This growth in hedge fund accounts is happening even though we still do not provide some of the products hedge funds used, like non-exchange listed products outside of cash ForEx, or first-hand research organization of meetings and introductions to corporate CEOs or CFOs. Our reversion toward non-exchange listed products is due to our fear of taking on counterparty credit risk that often turns out to be the source for existential difficulties in the business. But these products also create opportunities for outsized trading gains as they are usually exchanged listed options dressed in different cloth, i. e. different custom made terms, but they are always ultimately hedged by exchange listed products. Since their terms are unique, they cannot be directly compared to anything to ensure reasonable pricing. While we are not going to change our stance with respect to OTC products, we do not feel the same way about other products like research and corporate introductions. And as we continue to grow in this business, that is something we may consider in the future. The point is that ever since we started in the brokerage business we said that we will build our platform for the most demanding investors and we automate it so that we can easily make it available for anyone who may care to use it. We were often told that, that was not a realistic approach. You must choose your target audience. Relying on our growing hedge fund customer base, we are now able to turn this logic around and market the platform to the more sophisticated individual investors by saying to them to get better results, get a better platform. The best informed investors choose Interactive Brokers. We are planning to use this as our tagline and our branding efforts. Another welcome development during the quarter was the growth of our bond platform. For many years, this platform has been growing very slowly, recording about 1,000 trades a day. Suddenly, with more active bond market volumes, this now reaches 3,000 transactions a day. Given the relevance of bonds, our bonds marketplace has a search tool where you can scan by maturity date, yield to worst and duration to analyze and compare issuers and save your scan to run again at any time. Many of our customers realize that they can achieve better execution prices by sending us limit orders between the prevailing bids and offers. We go out to numerous other platforms to show these orders, but if no trade occurs and we get an offsetting order, we match the two. We also have order types that instruct us to keep the order internally and wait for a match. This way, the client is not driving the quote in the market against yourself. Despite the slower growth in accounts, we welcomed our 2 millionth customer in September, less than two years after adding our 2 millionth customer and ended the quarter with a record 2,012,000 accounts, an increase of 31% from last year. We saw account growth in all client segments and all geographic regions with particular strength 43% and 31% in Europe and Asia, which together represent the majority of our accounts. Account growth once again occurred in all five of the client types that we service. Individual account growth was fastest at 38%, followed by proprietary traders at 28%, introducing brokers at 20%, financial advisers at 14% and hedge funds at 13%. Commission for DART continues to rise as our clients continue to be active in options and especially in futures, which carry a higher commission, although the bulk of that goes to exchange fees. In equities, higher commission per DART was driven by a mix with fewer penny stock orders, where we limit our commissions not to exceed 1% of trade value. Higher futures commissions include very high exchange and regulatory fees, which in part explain our higher execution and clearing direct expense. An advantage of providing many product types to worldwide customers is the ability to capture opportunities when one product or another becomes active. This quarter, while stock share volumes were below those of last year, options and particularly future volumes remain strong. We are always looking to find opportunities to grow our business. We've been letting investors know that Interactive Brokers pays its clients 2.58% on their cash balances. And if the Federal Reserve raises rates again by 75 basis points, then their rate will also rise by 75 basis points to 3.33%. We recently introduced our options wizard, a tool where you can enter your outlook about the future of the underlyings price movement and the wizard will provide some standard strategies that can be filtered by aggressiveness or by probability of profit or you can set-up your own strategy. Continuing high inflation is a catalyst that convinces people that holding on to their money as cash will not earn them any return. Investing in securities worldwide will be necessary for a chance to earn a positive rate-of-return, which is why we have focused on investor educational materials like our Traders\u2019 Academy courses, our webinars, podcasts and blogs to inform our customers and make our platform the platform of choice for successful investors. The $2 million we have and the millions more we hope to have. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul?\nPaul Brody: Thank you, Nancy and thanks everyone as usual for joining the call. We will review the third quarter operating results and then we'll open it up for questions. Starting with our revenue items on page three of the release, we recorded another strong quarter with record net revenues and pretax income on an adjusted basis. With customer account growth at 31% year-over-year, we continued to expand our potential for both commission and interest revenues in the future. Commissions were strong reaching $320 million, despite weak equity markets worldwide. Futures volume outpaced the third quarter of 2021, options volume was roughly unchanged and while stock share volumes declined from last year's quarter, the drop in notional dollar value of stock trade was generally in line with the drop in regional equity indices around the world. Net interest income of $473 million reflected higher-margin loan interest despite lower balances, thanks to increases in benchmark rates and higher interest earned on our segregated cash portfolio as U.S. rates have moved from an average effective rate of 9 basis points last year to 218 basis points in this year's quarter. These gains were partially offset by higher interest we paid on customer credit balances, as we pass-through rate hikes above 50 basis points to our customers on their qualified fund. Other fees and services generated $45 million with biggest contributors being market data fees of $19 million unchanged and options exchange liquidity payments of $9 million, down 18% from the prior year. Risk exposure fee revenues were $5 million, down 38% in the current risk-off environment. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transaction. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings and without these excluded items, other income was $9 million for the quarter. Turning to expenses, execution, clearing and distribution costs rose 41% from last year, led by lower liquidity rebates, higher futures volumes which carry higher fees and an increase in the SEC fee rate on U.S. stocks and option. As a percent of commission revenues, execution and clearing costs which are driven by a combination of trading volume exchange rebates and changing fee schedules were 21% this quarter versus 18% in the second quarter. Note that market data expense, a pass-through item, is included in execution, clearing and distribution fees, while the corresponding market data revenue is reported in other fees and services rather than in commission. So to align the volume-driven expenses with commissions, we look at pure execution and clearing costs excluding market data expense. Compensation and benefits expense rose $14 million or 14% over the prior year in line with hiring, while up in dollar terms for the quarter, comp and benefits expense fell to 13% of our adjusted net revenues, somewhat below its historical level. Our headcount at quarter-end was 2,752. G&A expenses were down $7 million or 16% versus last year's third quarter on lower legal expenses from a higher than typical number last year. Our adjusted pretax margin was a record 68%, automation remains our key means maintaining high margins, as well as continued expense control while we hire talented people and invest in the future of our business. Income taxes of $40 million, reflects the sum of the public company's $23 million and the operating company's $17 million. Moving to our balance sheet on page five of the release. Our total assets were $115 billion at the end of the quarter, with growth over the last year driven by increases in our segregated cash and securities, partially offset by a reduction in customer margin loans. We maintain a balance sheet aimed at supporting our growing business and providing ample financial resources during volatile markets. We have no long-term debt. In our operating data on pages six and seven, our contract volumes for all customers were strong about even with the strong prior year quarter and options and the third highest ever in futures up 37%. Stock share volume was down significantly versus last year's active third quarter and the drop-off is largely attributable to trading in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks. Of note, the notional dollar value of shares traded dropped less than a number of shares traded, reflecting this shift away from low-priced stocks, which tends to raise the average commission per order. On page seven, you can see that our account growth remains robust with nearly 90,000 net account adds in the quarter and total accounts exceeding $2 million, up 31% over the prior year. Total customer DARTs were 1.9 million trades per day, down 15% from the strong prior year quarter. Our cleared IBKR pro customers paid an average of $2.96 commission per cleared commission of order, up 20% from last year as our clients' volume mix included higher per order contributions from stocks and options. Page eight presents our net interest margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income was $473 million for the quarter, up 73% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting stronger margin loan and segregated cash interest, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates twice in the quarter by 75 basis points in late July and by a further 75 points in late September, with about a week left in the quarter. The latter raised had a minor positive impact in a 12-week quarter, but will have a fuller positive impact in the third quarter. Many other Central Banks also raised rates this quarter. This group includes the U.K., Canada, Australia and Hong-Kong, as well as the Eurozone and Switzerland, which are now out of negative rate territory for the first time since 2014. Margin loan interest was up 125% to $317 million, despite average margin loan balances that were down 9% from last year's third quarter. Higher rates in the U.S. and internationally continue to bode well for our margin interest income. Net interest on segregated cash was $228 million, primarily due to Federal Reserve rate hikes, but also to our managing to short-duration on invested funds, which has allowed us to pickup benchmark rate increases quickly. At September 30, our U.S. portfolio duration was 42 days, so the investments roll-over into new higher rates with fairly short lag time. Securities\u2019 lending net interest was $114 million, down 7% from the year-ago quarter. It's worth noting that while securities lending opportunities maintain a relatively strong pace, it is also the case that as benchmark rates rise, a greater portion of the revenue generated by securities lending is reflected in interest on segregated cash, because the cash collateral received is invested as segregated fund. We estimate this impact to be about $24 million for the quarter versus the year-ago quarter. Interest on customer credit balances or the interest we pay our customers grew as higher rates in many currencies led to our paying interest on qualifying account as we pass-through rate increases. We paid $248 million to our customers on these balances in the third quarter. Now for our estimates of the impact of increases in rates. Given market expectations and more rates rate hikes to come, we estimate the effect of increases in the Fed funds rate to produce an additional annual net interest income as follows; at 25 basis points, an increase of $55 million; at 50 basis points, an increase of $110 million; at 75 basis points, an increase of $166 million; and at 100 basis points, an increase of $221 million. Note that our starting point for these estimates is September 30 with the Fed funds effective rate at 3.08% and based on balances at that date. These estimates don't take into account any change in how we may adjust our investment strategy to take advantage of newly higher rates or any change in our assets. About 20% of our customer segregated cash is not in U.S. dollars, so estimates of U.S. rate change impact exclude those currencies. We estimate a 25 basis point increase in all the relevant non-USD benchmark rates would produce an additional annual net interest income of $14 million and rising to about $56 million at a 100 basis point rate increase. In conclusion, the Company generated another solid performance in the third quarter, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer-base, deliver on our core services to customers, while continuously adding new features and products all at a low-cost and managing the business effectively with strong expense control. And with that we will open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Richard Repetto with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\nRichard Repetto: Yes, good evening, Thomas. Good evening, Paul. I guess the question -- first question is on account growth. You know, you -- Thomas you had sort of won that you're starting to feel or a slowdown, but if you look at the quarter, you had a couple months at about 20,000, 25,000 then one August excuse me, 38,000. So can you give us what do you feel like is the run-rate going forward and what happened? Why August it seemed like it was 35% to 50% higher than the other months? And just a little bit of color on -- I guess the delay, I guess just administrative delays with these introducing brokers?\nThomas Peterffy: So look the account growth is very lumpy, sometimes we get introducing brokers or larger RIAs who bunch up and will come to us in the same months and other months we have much fewer of those. But you generally understand that in these markets, people are not as anxious to open account with new account with a brokerage firm as they are enough markets, right. So I mean that's I think that's pretty clear to everybody. And so -- and things I expect the market to continue to go down for a while I expect the new account openings to become either slower or going forward, but as we have said -- indicated before that we have two large introducing broker accounts that we are going to onboard, probably early next year. And to tell you frankly, I am -- maybe Milan could talk a little bit about that, but all the complexities are right. It takes such a long time.\nMilan Galik: Sure. So, there are really two different things going on, one of them has to do with the fact that we are dealing with larger organizations and to just to arrive an agreement that we can both live with takes a while they are. There is an army of lawyers involved on their end, there is a smaller group of lawyers involved on our end and we have to hammer out the contract in a way that is acceptable to both of us, what the liabilities are. What the economics are et cetera, et cetera. So that's on the legal side. On the technology side, two things have to happen, first the I broker has to choose the way they're going to interact with us. How they're going to integrate? Are the clients going to use our platform? Or is the I broker going to provide their's. Is there going to be fixed connectivity involved? How are the accounts going to be opened, all these details first have to be figured out and they have to choose the right solution for them and then the integration work starts. We have to do some software customization for them, they have to do a lot of interfacing work on their end and this typically takes a while.\nRichard Repetto: Got it. Thank you that's very helpful Milan and Thomas. And I guess a follow-up question for Paul would be on this stock loan, like I'm trying to understand what you meant the $24 million that was paid on segregated cash? Is that really a subtraction of what would be revenue allocated to securities lending. Is that what you're trying to communicate?\nPaul Brody: It's just -- purely a matter of which line item the income is reported on. So as rates go up, when you lend stock and take-in cash collateral on behalf of the customer that cash gets put into segregated bank accounts and treasuries and so forth. And so that simply gets the interest earned is reported as segregated cash interest and as the rates go up, more interest goes there and stable amount of securities lending revenue stays in securities lending.\nRichard Repetto: Okay. So it actually would be -- if you just had to net out the revenue from securities lending, whether it'd be paid in interest on segregated cash, it would probably be -- it's not $114 compared to -- I think it was pretty flat year-over-year, it would be down is that what you say? I mean, it makes the difference, can you -- yes.\nPaul Brody: Yes, think of it this way when you lend stock and take in cash collateral, there is a base interest rate, a benchmark rate to call it Federal funds rate, right? There is a fee for borrowing the stock that the borrower pays to the lender -- we are the lender. The fee is always reflected as securities lending. In the U.S. however, the fee is embedded into an all-in rate that includes interest paid on the cash collateral and the fee charged to the lender. But only the fees should show-up in securities lending, it's an accounting convention if you will, but in reality because the cash side of the transaction must go into segregated cash as the rates go up. The interest income in a sense migrates from the securities lending reporting line for the segregated cash reporting line.\nRichard Repetto: Got it. Understood. It's really -- your net interest income definitely showed the sensitivities that you put out, so it's not really material I guess. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, one moment for questions. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good evening, Thomas and congratulations on eclipsing 2 million accounts.\nThomas Peterffy: Thank you.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So for these 30% account growth target over the next 12 months, roughly how much of that do you see coming from the three large introducing broker wins? Are they driving 75% of that?\nThomas Peterffy: Yes, 65% to 75% yes.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Got it. And then just to confirm, I think Nancy said no account inflows from those before the spring so April. So I'm guessing, we'll see none of the --\nThomas Peterffy: We're not sure about April, I mean, maybe. So at the beginning maybe they will open some accounts for the employees themselves to -- we have and then one of these banks is going to bring up accounts country-by-country and we don\u2019t exactly know in what order that is going to take place. So what I would say is the earliest maybe February and the latest maybe April.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. Thomas, thank you for taking my questions.\nThomas Peterffy: Thank you for asking them.\nOperator: Thank you, one moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ben Budish with Barclays. You may proceed.\nBen Budish: Hi guys, thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to kind of follow-up on the introducing broker topic, but maybe instead of talking about kind of the pipeline of new accounts. Could you perhaps talk a little bit about the pipeline of introducing brokers. So you mentioned that retail investors may be reluctant to open a new account environment, but are you finding the same sort of sentiment from potential new partners, banks and other financial institutions that may be a year from now, you may be telling us about the next wave of introducing progress. So I guess the question is how is the sentiment with that customer group?\nThomas Peterffy: So obviously, the sentiment is probably very similar across different brokers. And then we are talking about onboarding large introducing brokers we're basically talking about the existing accounts.\nBen Budish: Okay. Makes sense. Maybe one more -- one follow-up, if I could. Could you maybe talk a little bit about the hedge fund business since that seems to be where you're going to be a little bit more focused kind of in the near-term? Maybe just kind of help us understand a little bit the cost structure. I think you gave some helpful stats around the average revenue for your hedge fund and market banking clients. But is it in terms of the kind of net margin there? Is it more costly to serve? Or is it kind of a higher margin group just given the individual.\nThomas Peterffy: I was not talking about the cost. I was talking about revenues. So I took the revenues and coming from H1 and took the revenues coming from individual customers, it's true that 67 individual accounts generate as much revenue as an average hedge fund account in our case, right? And in our case, among the individual accounts, they are small accounts and large accounts and along the H1 accounts, there are also smaller accounts and large accounts. But so I'm just working with the averages here.\nBen Budish: Okay, great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Daniel Fannon with Jefferies.\nThomas Peterffy: We can\u2019t hear you.\nOperator: Daniel Fannon, if your line is on mute, please unmute. You may ask your question. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler here with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. Thanks for taking the follow-up. I had a follow-up on the hedge fund prime commentary that you gave earlier in the call. Are you starting to win business more from larger hedge funds? Or is the growth mostly from kind of smaller funds where I believe most of your business sit? And also where are you stealing this share from within the prime industry. And also, can you just comment on -- in terms of how this is going to drive earnings growth longer term, just given the size differential?\nThomas Peterffy: So yes, we have almost all smaller hedge funds come to us now and as far as we believe. And larger hedge funds are beginning to look at us and they usually work with two, three, maybe even four different custodians or at least executing brokers. And these larger fronts are talking to us more seriously and are giving us a little bit of their business. But we're very happy to take a little bit because we figured that as they begin to use us, they will see the advantages that we can offer relative to the custodian -- other custodians they are using.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thomas, and it sounds like, since you're very focused on growing this business. I believe that they're somewhat sensitive to the amount of capital you have. So maybe can you talk about when you'll feel more comfortable, I know probably not buying back stock just given the stock liquidity, but maybe raising the dividend or returning more capital to shareholders just because I believe a lot of those hedge funds are sensitive to how much capital you have?\nThomas Peterffy: I completely agree with you, and we are not going to increase the dividend. We are just going to grow the capital.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thomas thanks for taking my follow-ups.\nThomas Peterffy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ryan Bailey with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nRyan Bailey: Hi, everyone. Paul, in the right guidance for a few quarters now, you've mentioned that the guide is based on no change in strategy to take advantage of higher rates? I was wondering, is there a consideration to change some of the strategy around rate sensitivity?\nPaul Brody: We don't have any immediate plans. We have stayed short-term, because of the uncertainty in the markets. And certainly, with rates going up, we're able to capture that the upswing much quicker than had we been invested further out. If there wasn't a yield curve for a long time, it's sort of developing, but it's still only developing out through a year. So I think we're unlikely to make any meaningful changes there. Thomas, if you'd like to add anything to that, please feel free.\nThomas Peterffy: Yes, I'd like to point out that we pay our customer -- our interest on the idle cash of our customers more than anybody else that we know. And so we have -- we basically have had a 50 basis point spread that we earn on customers' idle cash. So that puts us into a position that -- where we have to be extremely careful about how we invest this cash, because when interest rates go up, we immediately raise the amount that we pay to our customers. So if we were to invest let\u2019s say, two years forward and suddenly interest rates are up, we would immediately have to increase the cash we pay out, but the amounts we taking would not increase immediately, right? So we cannot put ourselves into a position when we are very much mismatched.\nRyan Bailey: Right. Understood. Thank you. Thank you for the color. And maybe sort of taking that last point. I apologize if I missed it, but can you give us an update on where the sort of non-rate sensitive cash sits today, what that account looks like? And as we get through some of these introducing brokers, does that have any impact on what those cash balances could look like?\nThomas Peterffy: I don't know if any of you understand the question. Please answer it, I do not.\nPaul Brody: So Ryan, you're asking about the fully sensitive balances?\nRyan Bailey: The other side of it. So the balances were, I think, it's below $10,000 in cash per account that you're not paying rates on.\nPaul Brody: Right. So that's certainly the bulk of it, and there are a few other categories there totaling about $20 billion out of our total, which allows us to earn rate increases. And on the rest, we are locked into our spreads. So the net interest income increases will come from growing balances, but not from growing spreads.\nRyan Bailey: Understood. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Citi. You may proceed.\nChris Allen: Good afternoon, guys. Appreciate taking the questions. I guess just following up a little bit on the introducing broker, the ones that are coming over next year. Are these going to be fully disclosed or omnibus, I'm assuming fully disclosed, given the account impact?\nMilan Galik: Yes. So they are going to be bringing us individual accounts. So it's going to be a structure with a master account at the top and lots of sub-accounts underneath. As to fully disclosed, it's not going to be a fully disclosed relationship, so the end client will not know unless they try to research it who the ultimate provider of the services is. They will have the contract with their introducing broker. But to answer your question most directly, it's going to be lots of accounts, not an omnibus.\nChris Allen: Understood. And just on the outlook for hedge funds moving up to number four. Is that some analysis [Technical Difficulty] that you've done? Or is this based on kind of industry stats. Just trying to understand, just to dig little deeper, it seems to be a real nice opportunity moving forward?\nThomas Peterffy: Yes, it's industry stats, and we see our -- the rate at which we're getting in new funds. We're doing very well getting in new funds currently.\nChris Allen: Got it. Thank you, guys. That\u2019s it from me.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Daniel Fannon with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. Thanks. I'm going to try this again. Can you hear me?\nThomas Peterffy: Yes.\nDaniel Fannon: Great. So a question just on expenses came in a little bit better in this quarter and thinking about the fourth quarter and into next year, just the progression of spend, if there's -- as you bring on some of these larger introducing brokers, should we anticipate some additional expenses for that process and/or any change in priority as you think about spend into next year that you're contemplating at this point?\nMilan Galik: So no, these introducing brokers are not -- can you hear me?\nDaniel Fannon: Yes.\nMilan Galik: These introducing brokers are not expecting to lag has a terrible equity, I'm sorry. So we try to remove my headphone, so that I do not hear myself. What I was going to say that we do not expect to hire a large number of people to service these high brokers. Then we are going to use the technology that we have been developing over the past few decades to the extent that we have a very large number of subaccounts that we have to service. The number of customer service representatives will have to increase a little bit, but we expect the I Brokers to provide the customer service themselves. On the compliance side, the situation is little different, because we are responsible for doing the surveillance of their money mode, as well as the trading activity. So there is going to be some number of surveillance analysts that we will have to hire. But that number of analysts would be required, whether we grow the number of accounts as direct accounts of our clients or I broker clients.\nThomas Peterffy: And as far as expenses, I would like to add the fact that you are aware of the high rate of inflation and we have to increase our compensation [indiscernible] in line with inflation rate.\nDaniel Fannon: Great. And then just in terms of broadly account growth in the regions, you mentioned the subsegments of your customer base. Is it from a geographic perspective? Are there areas that you are having greater success? Or you're seeing more pullback understanding that broadly, as you said earlier, the sentiment isn't great for new account growth?\nThomas Peterffy: So yes, I mean Asia fell off the cliff about a year ago. And Europe joined soon after Russia went into the Ukraine. So yes, the slowdown is -- and as we go along, the European slowdown is becoming more and more apparent. And so in the United States, in the Americas, in general, the slowdown is less apparent than in Europe and Asia.\nDaniel Fannon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. You may proceed.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one for Paul, and sorry if this was addressed earlier, I dropped off. The other net interest income increased to $65 million in the quarter. Was just the majority of that increase driven by higher interest on corporate cash balances? I know there is some other items in there, too, including the FDIC suite. So I just wanted to get some clarity there.\nPaul Brody: Yes, that's right. It's primarily the corporate cash, which as you know, with rates near zero, was earning near zero. So therefore, we're now earning commensurate with the current benchmarks.\nKyle Voigt: Got it. And then the -- is there just any update you can give us on the percentage of your balances or is it just absolute level the cash balances that are -- or the credit balances that are non-rate sensitive or, I guess, non-interest bearing?\nPaul Brody: Yes. Actually, we did mention that before. It's about $20 billion out of the total.\nKyle Voigt: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nPaul Brody: That's a convention of fully rate-sensitive and partially rate sensitive.\nKyle Voigt: Perfect. Thank you. And then I just wanted to ask a clarification question regarding the introducing broker onboardings. I think last quarter, you mentioned several relationships that you expect to begin onboarding. And Thomas, I think you mentioned two large IB specifically. I just wanted to clarify was there any potential introducing broker clients that decided not to move forward with the relationship? Or is this just purely a timing issue and the pipeline hasn't changed at all in terms of number of clients?\nThomas Peterffy: There is no change in terms of number of clients.\nKyle Voigt: Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Richard Repetto with Piper Sandler. You may proceed.\nRichard Repetto: Yes. Hi, Thomas, I was just going to quickly follow-up. I know you're very conservative on the account growth. And if I just did the math and if the introducing brokers of 65% to 75% of your goal of 30% account growth overall. It just puts your -- I don't know what you would call it, organic account growth at numbers that certainly lower than what we've seen in the -- since the pandemic started. And I guess the question is, is that how you see the sort of a near-term year next year or two account growth slowing back to 2019 levels? And introducing, okay, okay, sorry.\nThomas Peterffy: Yes. I think that because, as I said, I expect the market not to be very buoyant. So I think that individual clients are going to dry up more and more and more as we go into next year.\nRichard Repetto: Got it. Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Nancy Stuebe for any further remarks.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will talk to you next quarter end.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Nancy Stuebe",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. Also joining us today are Milan Galik, our CEO; and Paul Brody, our CFO. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. This quarter showed the strength of the Interactive Brokers business model, automating substantial parts of the brokerage business in order to keep costs low and global product offerings and opportunities high even as unfavorable market conditions continued to extend into this quarter and beyond. While we were able to maintain our commission income just barely, it is understandable that in these mostly one way markets, only very few retail clients feel any urge to open new brokerage accounts. This has a large and unfavorable implication for the growth of our business and we expect this to continue into the early part of next year. In spite of that, by this time next year, we expect that our accounts will be about 30% higher than today due to some new larger introducing broker relationships we have mentioned earlier. Preparing to onboard these accounts is a very slow process and it is unlikely that any sign of these will show before the spring. Account number growth comes on the retail end from direct and introducing broker customers. A much of our commission income comes from hedge funds and proprietary trading groups. An average hedge fund account generates 67 times as much revenue as an average individual account, and for prop trading accounts, the small supplier is around 10 times. Hedge funds and proprietary trading accounts are less affected by the direction of the markets and are therefore our emphasis has turned more in their direction lately. As most recent prep and statistics illustrate, for the past three consecutive years, the number of hedge funds on our platform has grown faster than at any other leading banker broker. IBKR is now the sixth largest provider of prime brokerage services by number of funds, and we feel fairly confident about moving to the number four in the current year, right behind Morgan Stanley, Goldman and JPMorgan. This growth in hedge fund accounts is happening even though we still do not provide some of the products hedge funds used, like non-exchange listed products outside of cash ForEx, or first-hand research organization of meetings and introductions to corporate CEOs or CFOs. Our reversion toward non-exchange listed products is due to our fear of taking on counterparty credit risk that often turns out to be the source for existential difficulties in the business. But these products also create opportunities for outsized trading gains as they are usually exchanged listed options dressed in different cloth, i. e. different custom made terms, but they are always ultimately hedged by exchange listed products. Since their terms are unique, they cannot be directly compared to anything to ensure reasonable pricing. While we are not going to change our stance with respect to OTC products, we do not feel the same way about other products like research and corporate introductions. And as we continue to grow in this business, that is something we may consider in the future. The point is that ever since we started in the brokerage business we said that we will build our platform for the most demanding investors and we automate it so that we can easily make it available for anyone who may care to use it. We were often told that, that was not a realistic approach. You must choose your target audience. Relying on our growing hedge fund customer base, we are now able to turn this logic around and market the platform to the more sophisticated individual investors by saying to them to get better results, get a better platform. The best informed investors choose Interactive Brokers. We are planning to use this as our tagline and our branding efforts. Another welcome development during the quarter was the growth of our bond platform. For many years, this platform has been growing very slowly, recording about 1,000 trades a day. Suddenly, with more active bond market volumes, this now reaches 3,000 transactions a day. Given the relevance of bonds, our bonds marketplace has a search tool where you can scan by maturity date, yield to worst and duration to analyze and compare issuers and save your scan to run again at any time. Many of our customers realize that they can achieve better execution prices by sending us limit orders between the prevailing bids and offers. We go out to numerous other platforms to show these orders, but if no trade occurs and we get an offsetting order, we match the two. We also have order types that instruct us to keep the order internally and wait for a match. This way, the client is not driving the quote in the market against yourself. Despite the slower growth in accounts, we welcomed our 2 millionth customer in September, less than two years after adding our 2 millionth customer and ended the quarter with a record 2,012,000 accounts, an increase of 31% from last year. We saw account growth in all client segments and all geographic regions with particular strength 43% and 31% in Europe and Asia, which together represent the majority of our accounts. Account growth once again occurred in all five of the client types that we service. Individual account growth was fastest at 38%, followed by proprietary traders at 28%, introducing brokers at 20%, financial advisers at 14% and hedge funds at 13%. Commission for DART continues to rise as our clients continue to be active in options and especially in futures, which carry a higher commission, although the bulk of that goes to exchange fees. In equities, higher commission per DART was driven by a mix with fewer penny stock orders, where we limit our commissions not to exceed 1% of trade value. Higher futures commissions include very high exchange and regulatory fees, which in part explain our higher execution and clearing direct expense. An advantage of providing many product types to worldwide customers is the ability to capture opportunities when one product or another becomes active. This quarter, while stock share volumes were below those of last year, options and particularly future volumes remain strong. We are always looking to find opportunities to grow our business. We've been letting investors know that Interactive Brokers pays its clients 2.58% on their cash balances. And if the Federal Reserve raises rates again by 75 basis points, then their rate will also rise by 75 basis points to 3.33%. We recently introduced our options wizard, a tool where you can enter your outlook about the future of the underlyings price movement and the wizard will provide some standard strategies that can be filtered by aggressiveness or by probability of profit or you can set-up your own strategy. Continuing high inflation is a catalyst that convinces people that holding on to their money as cash will not earn them any return. Investing in securities worldwide will be necessary for a chance to earn a positive rate-of-return, which is why we have focused on investor educational materials like our Traders' Academy courses, our webinars, podcasts and blogs to inform our customers and make our platform the platform of choice for successful investors. The $2 million we have and the millions more we hope to have. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul? Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will talk to you next quarter end."

            "name": "Paul Brody",
            "content": "Thank you, Nancy and thanks everyone as usual for joining the call. We will review the third quarter operating results and then we'll open it up for questions. Starting with our revenue items on page three of the release, we recorded another strong quarter with record net revenues and pretax income on an adjusted basis. With customer account growth at 31% year-over-year, we continued to expand our potential for both commission and interest revenues in the future. Commissions were strong reaching $320 million, despite weak equity markets worldwide. Futures volume outpaced the third quarter of 2021, options volume was roughly unchanged and while stock share volumes declined from last year's quarter, the drop in notional dollar value of stock trade was generally in line with the drop in regional equity indices around the world. Net interest income of $473 million reflected higher-margin loan interest despite lower balances, thanks to increases in benchmark rates and higher interest earned on our segregated cash portfolio as U.S. rates have moved from an average effective rate of 9 basis points last year to 218 basis points in this year's quarter. These gains were partially offset by higher interest we paid on customer credit balances, as we pass-through rate hikes above 50 basis points to our customers on their qualified fund. Other fees and services generated $45 million with biggest contributors being market data fees of $19 million unchanged and options exchange liquidity payments of $9 million, down 18% from the prior year. Risk exposure fee revenues were $5 million, down 38% in the current risk-off environment. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transaction. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings and without these excluded items, other income was $9 million for the quarter. Turning to expenses, execution, clearing and distribution costs rose 41% from last year, led by lower liquidity rebates, higher futures volumes which carry higher fees and an increase in the SEC fee rate on U.S. stocks and option. As a percent of commission revenues, execution and clearing costs which are driven by a combination of trading volume exchange rebates and changing fee schedules were 21% this quarter versus 18% in the second quarter. Note that market data expense, a pass-through item, is included in execution, clearing and distribution fees, while the corresponding market data revenue is reported in other fees and services rather than in commission. So to align the volume-driven expenses with commissions, we look at pure execution and clearing costs excluding market data expense. Compensation and benefits expense rose $14 million or 14% over the prior year in line with hiring, while up in dollar terms for the quarter, comp and benefits expense fell to 13% of our adjusted net revenues, somewhat below its historical level. Our headcount at quarter-end was 2,752. G&A expenses were down $7 million or 16% versus last year's third quarter on lower legal expenses from a higher than typical number last year. Our adjusted pretax margin was a record 68%, automation remains our key means maintaining high margins, as well as continued expense control while we hire talented people and invest in the future of our business. Income taxes of $40 million, reflects the sum of the public company's $23 million and the operating company's $17 million. Moving to our balance sheet on page five of the release. Our total assets were $115 billion at the end of the quarter, with growth over the last year driven by increases in our segregated cash and securities, partially offset by a reduction in customer margin loans. We maintain a balance sheet aimed at supporting our growing business and providing ample financial resources during volatile markets. We have no long-term debt. In our operating data on pages six and seven, our contract volumes for all customers were strong about even with the strong prior year quarter and options and the third highest ever in futures up 37%. Stock share volume was down significantly versus last year's active third quarter and the drop-off is largely attributable to trading in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks. Of note, the notional dollar value of shares traded dropped less than a number of shares traded, reflecting this shift away from low-priced stocks, which tends to raise the average commission per order. On page seven, you can see that our account growth remains robust with nearly 90,000 net account adds in the quarter and total accounts exceeding $2 million, up 31% over the prior year. Total customer DARTs were 1.9 million trades per day, down 15% from the strong prior year quarter. Our cleared IBKR pro customers paid an average of $2.96 commission per cleared commission of order, up 20% from last year as our clients' volume mix included higher per order contributions from stocks and options. Page eight presents our net interest margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income was $473 million for the quarter, up 73% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting stronger margin loan and segregated cash interest, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates twice in the quarter by 75 basis points in late July and by a further 75 points in late September, with about a week left in the quarter. The latter raised had a minor positive impact in a 12-week quarter, but will have a fuller positive impact in the third quarter. Many other Central Banks also raised rates this quarter. This group includes the U.K., Canada, Australia and Hong-Kong, as well as the Eurozone and Switzerland, which are now out of negative rate territory for the first time since 2014. Margin loan interest was up 125% to $317 million, despite average margin loan balances that were down 9% from last year's third quarter. Higher rates in the U.S. and internationally continue to bode well for our margin interest income. Net interest on segregated cash was $228 million, primarily due to Federal Reserve rate hikes, but also to our managing to short-duration on invested funds, which has allowed us to pickup benchmark rate increases quickly. At September 30, our U.S. portfolio duration was 42 days, so the investments roll-over into new higher rates with fairly short lag time. Securities' lending net interest was $114 million, down 7% from the year-ago quarter. It's worth noting that while securities lending opportunities maintain a relatively strong pace, it is also the case that as benchmark rates rise, a greater portion of the revenue generated by securities lending is reflected in interest on segregated cash, because the cash collateral received is invested as segregated fund. We estimate this impact to be about $24 million for the quarter versus the year-ago quarter. Interest on customer credit balances or the interest we pay our customers grew as higher rates in many currencies led to our paying interest on qualifying account as we pass-through rate increases. We paid $248 million to our customers on these balances in the third quarter. Now for our estimates of the impact of increases in rates. Given market expectations and more rates rate hikes to come, we estimate the effect of increases in the Fed funds rate to produce an additional annual net interest income as follows; at 25 basis points, an increase of $55 million; at 50 basis points, an increase of $110 million; at 75 basis points, an increase of $166 million; and at 100 basis points, an increase of $221 million. Note that our starting point for these estimates is September 30 with the Fed funds effective rate at 3.08% and based on balances at that date. These estimates don't take into account any change in how we may adjust our investment strategy to take advantage of newly higher rates or any change in our assets. About 20% of our customer segregated cash is not in U.S. dollars, so estimates of U.S. rate change impact exclude those currencies. We estimate a 25 basis point increase in all the relevant non-USD benchmark rates would produce an additional annual net interest income of $14 million and rising to about $56 million at a 100 basis point rate increase. In conclusion, the Company generated another solid performance in the third quarter, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer-base, deliver on our core services to customers, while continuously adding new features and products all at a low-cost and managing the business effectively with strong expense control. And with that we will open it up for questions. It's just -- purely a matter of which line item the income is reported on. So as rates go up, when you lend stock and take-in cash collateral on behalf of the customer that cash gets put into segregated bank accounts and treasuries and so forth. And so that simply gets the interest earned is reported as segregated cash interest and as the rates go up, more interest goes there and stable amount of securities lending revenue stays in securities lending. Yes, think of it this way when you lend stock and take in cash collateral, there is a base interest rate, a benchmark rate to call it Federal funds rate, right? There is a fee for borrowing the stock that the borrower pays to the lender -- we are the lender. The fee is always reflected as securities lending. In the U.S. however, the fee is embedded into an all-in rate that includes interest paid on the cash collateral and the fee charged to the lender. But only the fees should show-up in securities lending, it's an accounting convention if you will, but in reality because the cash side of the transaction must go into segregated cash as the rates go up. The interest income in a sense migrates from the securities lending reporting line for the segregated cash reporting line. We don't have any immediate plans. We have stayed short-term, because of the uncertainty in the markets. And certainly, with rates going up, we're able to capture that the upswing much quicker than had we been invested further out. If there wasn't a yield curve for a long time, it's sort of developing, but it's still only developing out through a year. So I think we're unlikely to make any meaningful changes there. Thomas, if you'd like to add anything to that, please feel free. So Ryan, you're asking about the fully sensitive balances? Right. So that's certainly the bulk of it, and there are a few other categories there totaling about $20 billion out of our total, which allows us to earn rate increases. And on the rest, we are locked into our spreads. So the net interest income increases will come from growing balances, but not from growing spreads. Yes, that's right. It's primarily the corporate cash, which as you know, with rates near zero, was earning near zero. So therefore, we're now earning commensurate with the current benchmarks. Yes. Actually, we did mention that before. It's about $20 billion out of the total. That's a convention of fully rate-sensitive and partially rate sensitive."

            "name": "Thomas Peterffy",
            "content": "So look the account growth is very lumpy, sometimes we get introducing brokers or larger RIAs who bunch up and will come to us in the same months and other months we have much fewer of those. But you generally understand that in these markets, people are not as anxious to open account with new account with a brokerage firm as they are enough markets, right. So I mean that's I think that's pretty clear to everybody. And so -- and things I expect the market to continue to go down for a while I expect the new account openings to become either slower or going forward, but as we have said -- indicated before that we have two large introducing broker accounts that we are going to onboard, probably early next year. And to tell you frankly, I am -- maybe Milan could talk a little bit about that, but all the complexities are right. It takes such a long time. Thank you. Yes, 65% to 75% yes. We're not sure about April, I mean, maybe. So at the beginning maybe they will open some accounts for the employees themselves to -- we have and then one of these banks is going to bring up accounts country-by-country and we don't exactly know in what order that is going to take place. So what I would say is the earliest maybe February and the latest maybe April. Thank you for asking them. So obviously, the sentiment is probably very similar across different brokers. And then we are talking about onboarding large introducing brokers we're basically talking about the existing accounts. I was not talking about the cost. I was talking about revenues. So I took the revenues and coming from H1 and took the revenues coming from individual customers, it's true that 67 individual accounts generate as much revenue as an average hedge fund account in our case, right? And in our case, among the individual accounts, they are small accounts and large accounts and along the H1 accounts, there are also smaller accounts and large accounts. But so I'm just working with the averages here. We can't hear you. So yes, we have almost all smaller hedge funds come to us now and as far as we believe. And larger hedge funds are beginning to look at us and they usually work with two, three, maybe even four different custodians or at least executing brokers. And these larger fronts are talking to us more seriously and are giving us a little bit of their business. But we're very happy to take a little bit because we figured that as they begin to use us, they will see the advantages that we can offer relative to the custodian -- other custodians they are using. I completely agree with you, and we are not going to increase the dividend. We are just going to grow the capital. Thank you. Yes, I'd like to point out that we pay our customer -- our interest on the idle cash of our customers more than anybody else that we know. And so we have -- we basically have had a 50 basis point spread that we earn on customers' idle cash. So that puts us into a position that -- where we have to be extremely careful about how we invest this cash, because when interest rates go up, we immediately raise the amount that we pay to our customers. So if we were to invest let's say, two years forward and suddenly interest rates are up, we would immediately have to increase the cash we pay out, but the amounts we taking would not increase immediately, right? So we cannot put ourselves into a position when we are very much mismatched. I don't know if any of you understand the question. Please answer it, I do not. Yes, it's industry stats, and we see our -- the rate at which we're getting in new funds. We're doing very well getting in new funds currently. Yes. And as far as expenses, I would like to add the fact that you are aware of the high rate of inflation and we have to increase our compensation [indiscernible] in line with inflation rate. So yes, I mean Asia fell off the cliff about a year ago. And Europe joined soon after Russia went into the Ukraine. So yes, the slowdown is -- and as we go along, the European slowdown is becoming more and more apparent. And so in the United States, in the Americas, in general, the slowdown is less apparent than in Europe and Asia. There is no change in terms of number of clients. Yes. I think that because, as I said, I expect the market not to be very buoyant. So I think that individual clients are going to dry up more and more and more as we go into next year."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Nancy Stuebe, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but has asked me to present his comments on the business. Also joining us today are Milan Galik, our CEO and Paul Brody, our CFO. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the Company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the Company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. I will start today's call with the bad news. In the first half of 2022, circumstances did not evolve in our favor. First, starting at the end of last year, activity diminished in Asia because of China's crackdown on large privately owned companies, and many of our clients from that region suffered outsized losses. Then late in the first quarter, the impact of the war in Ukraine began to be felt on the European economy, chilling the mood of our customers in that region. Finally, early in the second quarter, the delayed response by the Fed to inflationary pressures created fears of a recession in the U.S., sending prices into bear market territory. Deficit spending in the U.S. has limited the government's ability to respond to rising inflation with increasingly higher interest rates. As for each 1% hike, interest on U.S. debt increases by $300 billion as it gets refinanced. So inflation is likely to stay with us. The same difficulty in raising rates in the face of higher inflation and the same causes are also occurring in Europe. Customer losses in their accounts in the markets were substantial. Adding to that, the impact of the withdrawal of all funded accounts by Futu to their own new clearing firm and an introducing broker using a custodial bank while still executing with us, our customers funds diminished by about $80 billion over the past two quarters. In addition, our net new account openings plummeted by about 40% by the end of the quarter. On a brighter note, now for the good news. It seems that many large global financial institutions are looking at the other side of this market valley and are beginning to focus on their client's trading needs. These clients more and more often want to run globally diversified portfolios heavily weighted towards U.S. equities, no matter where they live. Satisfying that demand would necessitate that they consolidate worldwide their often separately and locally developed technology and operations. Several such institutions believe that they can get there sooner by putting their clients on IBKR's platform now and begin working on developing the tools to serve their unique specific client financial needs better. IBKR has reached a positive conclusion in several such discussions. These institutions will onboard their clients gradually and separately by type and location beginning later in the third quarter, while others will start later this year and next. These will be introducing broker accounts unless they will add to our number of accounts. It is for this reason that in spite of our number of net new account openings having declined by 40% by the end of the quarter, I expect this drop to be temporary as the new introducing brokers accounts will begin to show up. Accordingly, I still project long-term account growth of 30%. Most of our technology development capacity in the near future will be devoted to building systems that make our introducing broker and worldwide RIA platforms even more compelling. With this backdrop, we are pleased with how our business performed. We ended the quarter with a record 1,923,000 accounts, a net increase of 36% from last June. We saw account growth at all client segments in all geographic regions with particular strength, 49% and 38% in Europe and Asia, which together represent the majority of our accounts. As our client base grows, DARTs have risen as well. Second quarter total DARTs were strong at over 2.1 million. While trading in the U.S. seems to be holding steady, we began seeing some easing of trading activity in Europe and Asia due to declining markets. Commission per DART rose due to product mix as volumes continue to be strong in futures and options, which carry a higher commission. While in equities, higher commissions per DART were from more active trading and higher priced stocks, which helped boost commissions over last year. Higher futures commissions include very high exchange and regulatory fees, which in part explain our higher execution and clearing direct expense. Higher DARTs and commission per trade led to our total commission revenues rising to $322 million, the third highest in company history and behind only the unusually active trading periods in the first quarters of this year and last. Options and futures volumes continue to be strong. In the second quarter, in the U.S., listed options volume for the industry saw average daily volume of nearly 40 million contracts, one of the highest on record and up 8%. Interactive Brokers options volumes were even stronger, up 11%. Our futures business was even better with our contract volumes up 46% over last year, nearly twice the 25% increase in industry volumes. As inflation can lead to higher commodities prices, investors often use commodity features to participate, especially when there is also volatility in the markets. Interactive Brokers has become better at offering our customers new and innovative products, while also enabling them to navigate through our many high-quality features at ever greater efficiency, helping them to establish their own personalized work environments and tools. Superior customer experience our platform offers continues to be spread by word-of-mouth as well as by our institutional sales team. In uncertain markets, the quality of our capital base matters. Our capital base grew even stronger during this period with total equity reaching $10.6 billion this quarter. This base funds our business and countries around the world, helps us to attract larger customers and reassures clients looking to participate in the markets. We saw account growth once again in all five of the client types that we service. Individual account growth was fastest at 44%, followed by proprietary traders at 32%, introducing brokers at 24%, financial advisers at 15% and hedge funds at 10%. We are always looking to find opportunities and grow our business. We continue to place enhanced focus on our marketing efforts, and we have increased spending in this area from last year. We are letting investors know that Interactive Brokers pays its clients over 1.08% on their cash balances and if the federal reserve raises rates by 75 basis points, then their rate will also rise by 75 basis points to 1.83%. We recently introduced fractional trading in European stocks so our clients can purchase as little as $1 of almost any U.S. or European stock. And in the UK, you can now open a Stocks and Shares ISA. We continue to add to the functionality of our IMPACT app. We have recently added the ability to offset a selection of specific carbon emitting activities, giving clients the ability to offset their footprint and keep track in their statements all from their IBKR account. We still see higher inflation as a catalyst that convinces more people that holding onto their money as cash is a losing proposition. Investing in equities worldwide will be necessary to earn a return and Interactive Brokers will be there with our innovative platform and educational materials. We aim to be the platform of choice for the best-informed, most successful investors and we look forward to welcoming our two millionth customer in the next few months. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through our numbers for the quarter. Paul?\nPaul Brody: Thanks, Nancy. Thanks, everyone for joining the call. I will review the second quarter operating results and then we will open it up for questions. Starting with our revenue items on Page 3 of the release, we recorded another strong quarter with increases in net revenues and pre-tax income on an adjusted basis. With customer account growth at 36% year-over-year, we are expanding our potential for both commission and interest revenues in the future. Commissions were strong reaching their third highest quarterly revenue ever at $322 million. Options and futures volumes outpaced the second quarter of 2021 and while stock share volumes declined from last year's quarter, notional value of stock trades actually rose. Net interest income of $348 million reflected higher margin loan interest despite relatively unchanged balances. Thanks to increases in benchmark rates and higher interest earned on our segregated cash portfolio as U.S. rates have moved from an average effective rate of 7 basis points last year to 77 basis points in this year's quarter. These gains were partially offset by higher interest we paid on customer credit balances as we passed through rate hikes above 50 basis points to our customers on their qualified funds. Other fees and services generated $43 million, with market data fees of $19 million, down 5%, and risk exposure fee revenue of $6 million, down 14%. Options exchange liquidity payments $9 million were even with the prior year. Declines in IPO fees and especially in account activity fees, which were discontinued after the second quarter of 2021, reduced the total in this line item. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings. And without these excluded items, other income was positive $4 million for the quarter.  Turning to expenses. Execution, clearing and distribution costs rose 43% from last year led by strong futures volumes, which carry higher fees, lower exchange liquidity rebates, and a smaller clearing fee rebate than in last year's second quarter. As a percent of commission revenues, execution and clearing costs, which are driven by a combination of trading volume, exchange rebates and changing fee schedules, were 18% this quarter, meaning 82% of incremental commission revenue dropped to the bottom line. While this cost ratio fluctuates over time with product mix and trading volumes, the factors that tend to drive it lower over time remain in place, with exchanges offering liquidity rebates and competing on costs, which gives our Smart Router the opportunity to improve on execution quality for our IBKR Pro clients. Compensation and benefits expense, while up in dollar terms for the quarter as we continued to expand hiring to support our strong growth, was 16% of our adjusted net revenues consistent with its historical level. Our headcount at quarter end was 2,780. G&A expenses were up $7 million versus last year on increases in advertising, legal expenses and administrative fees. Our adjusted pre-tax margin was a robust 63%. Automation remains our key means of maintaining high margins as well as continued expense control, while we hire talented people and invest in the future of our business. $32 million of income taxes reflects the sum of the operating company's $16 million and the public company's $16 million. Moving to our balance sheet on Page 5 of the release. Our total assets were $113 billion at the end of the quarter with growth over the last year driven by increases in our segregated cash and securities, partially offset by a reduction in customer margin loans. Our consolidated equity capital was $10.6 billion, and we have no long-term debt. In our operating data on Pages 6 and 7, our contract volumes for all customers were strong, up 11% on the year in options and the second highest ever in futures, up 46%. Stock share volume was down significantly versus last year's active second quarter, and the drop-off is largely attributable to trading in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks. Of note, the notional value of shares traded actually increased over the prior year, reflecting a shift toward trading higher price stocks, which tends to raise the average commission per order. On Page 7, you can see that our account growth remains robust with over 114,000 net accounts added in the quarter and total accounts reaching 1.9 million, up 36% over the prior year. Total customer DARTs were just under 2.2 million trades per day, down 6% from the strong prior year quarter. Our cleared IBKR Pro customers paid an average of $2.74 commission per cleared commissionable order, up 15% from last year as our clients' volume mix included higher per order contributions from stocks and options. Page 8 of the release presents our net interest margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income was $348 million for the quarter, up 27% on the year-ago quarter, reflecting stronger margin loan and segregated cash interest partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates twice in the quarter by 50 basis points in early May and by a further 75 points in June with about two weeks left in a quarter. The latter raise had a minor positive impact in a 12-week quarter, but of course will have a full positive impact in the third quarter. Other regions also raised rates this quarter. This group includes the UK, Canada, Australia and Hong Kong. Margin loan interest was up 54% to $197 million despite average margin loan balances relatively unchanged from last year's second quarter. Higher rates in the U.S. and internationally bode well for our margin interest income. Net interest on segregated cash turned positive in the first quarter. And in the second quarter, we earned $53 million on these balances, primarily due to the two Federal funds \u2013 the Federal Reserve rate hikes, but also to our managing to short duration on invested funds. At June 30, our U.S. portfolio duration was 45 days, for the investments rollover into new higher rates with a fairly short lag time. Securities lending net interest was $116 million, down from the $136 million in the active year-ago quarter although revenue opportunities on hard-to-borrow stocks trended up during the quarter. It's worth noting that while securities lending opportunities maintained a strong pace, it is also the case that as benchmark rates rise, a greater portion of the revenue generated by securities lending is reflected in interest on segregated cash because the cash collateral received is invested as segregated funds. We estimate this impact to be about $10 million for the quarter. Interest on customer credit balances, or the interest we pay our customers is returning to its historical norm as higher rates in many currencies result in our paying interest as we pass through rate increases. We paid $37 million to our customers on these balances in the second quarter. Now for our estimates of the impact of increases in rates. Given market expectations more rate hikes to come, we estimate the effects of increases in the Fed funds rate to produce additional annual net interest income as follows: At 25 basis points, an increase of $57 million annually; at 50 basis points, an increase of $115 million; at 75 basis points, an increase of $172 million; and at 100 basis points, an increase of $229 million. Note that our starting point for these estimates is June 30, with the Fed funds effective rate at 1.58%, and also based on balances at that date. These estimates do not take into account any change in how we may adjust our investment strategy or take advantage of newly higher rates or any change in our assets. About 21% of our customer segregated cash is not in U.S. dollars, so estimates of U.S. rate change impacts exclude those currencies. We estimate a 25 basis point increase in all the relevant non-U.S. benchmark rates would produce additional annual net interest income of about $10 million and that rising to about $40 million at a full 100 basis point increase. In conclusion, we put forward another solid performance in the second quarter, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base, deliver on our core services to customers while continuously adding new features and products and manage the business effectively with strong expense control. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Your question, please.\nRichard Repetto: My question is a follow-up on the prepared remarks and the account growth that you expect in the back half of the year. I guess, Thomas, could you give us some more detail on the ranges that you have? And how will that \u2013 will it \u2013 will we still see the same \u2013 how will that run through? I guess, I'm trying to figure out like we normally model close to your 30%, but if it's going to come in chunks or what do you foresee for the \u2013 more detail on the account growth?\nThomas Peterffy: As I said, the current account growth is roughly 40% below our average growth over, say the last year and these new types of accounts will start kicking in very, very late this quarter and then gradually more and more of them through the first quarter of next year.\nRichard Repetto: So would you think that it will sort of bridge a little bit of that gap towards back\u2026\nThomas Peterffy: So what happened was that when the market collapsed in June, it was right? Yes. So \u2013 or late May, I don't know when the terrible day was. So since that time, the new account fundings are way down, right? And that seems to be continuing strangely. And so I can't really say what will happen with the existing type of business other than to project forward what is going on right now, which is a lower level of account fundings of say about 15% growth. And I expect these new types of accounts to \u2013 as I said to begin coming in very late this quarter and then continuing and gaining speed as we go into next year.\nRichard Repetto: Got it. Okay. And then my follow-up question would be, you have brought on a lot of accounts over the past year and a half to two years. And I'm just trying to \u2013 do you see \u2013 we see the average trades per account down, but we also see the commission rising because the trades that I've done are \u2013 there's more of a mix of futures and options. So I guess the question is these accounts \u2013 the large number you've brought in, how do you view the quality of the account? And do you expect \u2013 do you still expect them like to season and to mature and trade more actively over time? Or are they there different type that's been brought on?\nThomas Peterffy: So as you know, we have basically five types of accounts and the newer individual accounts tend to be smaller, but the other accounts and the newer introducing broker accounts that tend to be smaller and less productive, but the [SI], hedge fund, prop traders and financial advisors are concerned, they are basically the same. So to the extent that our growth is more pronounced among individual accounts and introducing brokers, yes, overall the new accounts are less productive than the old ones.\nRichard Repetto: Understood. That's all I had. Have a good evening, Thomas.\nThomas Peterffy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Daniel Fannon from Jefferies. Your question, please.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. This is actually [indiscernible] subbing in for Dan. I just wanted to ask what the recent hike in interest rates and the prospect sort of more to come. How are you guys thinking about sort of the duration and the makeup of your investment portfolio and to kind of like generate higher returns?\nThomas Peterffy: No, we are not. That's the kind of risk that we do not want to take.\nUnidentified Analyst: Understood. And then\u2026\nThomas Peterffy: We will continue to invest in T-bills and repos.\nUnidentified Analyst: Understood. Okay. And then just to confirm the sort of 21% cash that's oversee, the investment philosophy on that front is pretty consistent with the U.S. counterpart. Is that right?\nPaul Brody: Yes. In particular outside the U.S., we are more \u2013 even more constrained to putting client money in banks. We use very large \u2013 the largest of the international banks, but primarily those are the only investments we're permitted to make currently.\nUnidentified Analyst: Understood. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your question, please.\nKyle Voigt: Hi. Thank you. So with 79% of the cash balances in U.S. dollar, I would've expected a bit higher yield on your said cash balances in the quarter. I just want to confirm whether there's some lag effect from rising U.S. rates given that 45-day duration that you disclosed. Paul, if you just could confirm that or not, if we're kind of yet to see some of the benefit from the 2Q rate hikes come through maybe in the third quarter?\nPaul Brody: Yes, sure. I mean that is the 45-day lag, which is why we try to put it out there, so you have the proper expectation of the rollover rate. But yes, given that rates most recently increased in May and June, the full effect has not been held. We have not recorded the full effect yet. And then, of course, the market is projecting further rate increases. And so you can probably assume that our lag time will stay relatively constant.\nKyle Voigt: And just to \u2013 maybe I'm oversimplifying it, but if you were at a zero-day duration or investing just in overnight, you mentioned average Fed funds in the U.S. was 77 basis points in the second quarter. If we assume that 79% of those cash balances were earn at 77 basis points, you get to something like a 60 basis point yield for 2Q. So it's a pretty big variance. So that entire variance between kind of that math that I just ran through that 60 basis points and the 42 is just that 45-day duration kind of mismatch with the math that I just ran through. Is that fair? I just want to make sure that we're kind of modeling that said cash yield correctly on a go forward basis?\nThomas Peterffy: Yes. But you have to include what we are paying to the customers, right? You're including that, right?\nKyle Voigt: Yes. I'm just talking about the said cash yield specifically, so not the credit.\nThomas Peterffy: Yes. But if you look at the total balance, we also pay to customers. So that reduces the rate [waver or net] [ph] .\nPaul Brody: So about 20 something percent and low-20s are actually fully interest rate sensitive, meaning that we \u2013 they fall into categories or account sizes that we don't pay interest on. So we get the full benefit of the rate increases on that portion.\nKyle Voigt: Yes. Okay.\nPaul Brody: [We are actually pass-through] now that interest rates are sufficiently positive in the U.S. We pass through all of the additional rate increases, except on those low \u2013 on those small balances.\nKyle Voigt: Okay. And sorry if I missed an explanation on this in the prepared remarks, but just the other fees and services revenues. I think we're down in the quarter sequentially and year-over-year. I just wanted to know if you could provide a bit more color on that. I know there's a lot of things that go into that line, like risk exposure fees and order flow income, account market data fees, et cetera. So just want to know if this is a kind of new run rate or whether or not we should see a bounce back heading into the third quarter?\nPaul Brody: Right. So the primary factor that went down was \u2013 were the account activity fees because we discontinued them mid last year. So you would not expect to see those, those were $9 million in the last year quarter and $1 million in this quarter. That's a policy change, don't expect that to bounce back. The other changes were quite a bit smaller. Small changes in market data, small changes in exposure fees.\nKyle Voigt: But I guess the \u2013 I think the line declined about $10 million sequentially from $53 million to $43 million. And I guess that is related to \u2013 was that related to more?\nPaul Brody: Right. Sequentially, the largest factor was actually a drop in the exposure fees. But remember how we think about exposure fees, they're there to help us influence the customers to take less risk in specific ways. We run lots of stress tests that look at different scenarios. And when we find certain kinds of risk that we feel that the standard margin amounts requirements may not be covering in a stress scenario, our system automatically charges exposure fees, which the customer can then decide either to keep the position on and pay the exposure fees to us. These are on overnight position or trim the risk on the position and avoid the exposure fee. So we're not unhappy to see the exposure fees go down because that means we're taking somewhat less risk and that makes us more comfortable.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. And last question for me, and I'll jump back in the queue was just really around the execution and clearing fees. They were up 8% sequentially, while your commission revenues were down 8% sequentially. Just wondering if you could elaborate a bit more on that. I know you gave some explanations in the prepared remarks, but any more color you could kind of provide there given those diverging trends on the revenue expense side?\nPaul Brody: The general factors that I cited greater proportion of futures volume, which has a higher fee base and options as well as opposed to stocks, somewhat lower exchange liquidity rebates, these all combine and cause the aggregate number to not necessarily go hand-in-hand with the volume change or even the commission change. Generally speaking, the larger trends they do go hand-in-hand. But from quarter-to-quarter, we see a different product mix and that can cause these sort of seeming anomalies.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Your question, please.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey. Good evening, Thomas and team. Hope you all doing well.\nThomas Peterffy: Yes we are. Thank you.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So we had a follow-up to Rich's first question, and we're obviously not looking for any names, but can you provide any additional color on these global financial institutions? Where are they in their clients based and what exactly will they be using IBKR for?\nThomas Peterffy: Hi. Thanks for your question. So we have a number of larger introducing brokers that we are integrating with right now. They are of the larger size. There are three of them. I would not \u2013 I would rather not tell you who they are. They have not publicized the partnership with us either, so we just have to wait for that announcement. All I can tell you is that these are international organizations catering to clients from more than just one country.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you. And just for my follow-up, in the month of May, you lost an omnibus introducing broker custody relationship to a trust bank. I was just wondering if you could provide perspective on this outflow and also how could a trust bank win that business from IBKR?\nThomas Peterffy: So this was one large Japanese introducing broker. We love them because they realized that they concentrated too much of their business in a single custodian. They decided to diversify. I think it was a prudent step for them, looking at it from their perspective. So that is what they have done. They currently custody with a provider that is offering them the solution of the trust bank. So that's what they went for.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Bailey from Goldman Sachs. Your question, please.\nRyan Bailey: Hi. Good evening, everyone. So some of the account growth slowdown. I was wondering if you could give us some color on the GlobalTrader side. If there's been any difference in the accounts or the uses of the GlobalTrader app? And then maybe just as my follow-up, I'll sort of put it through that. Any color on the typical account sizes or the cash balances for those types of accounts?\nThomas Peterffy: We started marketing the GlobalTrader not that long ago. We have more than 1,000 accounts. We have a lot of downloads. We would like those downloads to turn into more funded account, of course, but the adoption rate is picking up. We are advertising the GlobalTrader to despite the fact that it's a simple trading up that currently allows trading of stocks in cryptocurrencies you would think that it really benefits the most of the retail clients as you can imagine. We are advertising it to larger account holders in the way that we try to appeal to the fact that despite that most of the [affluent] investors finances are managed by financial advisors, we believe that they should be willing to do an occasional trade themselves, and that is what we are advertising to them. But the GlobalTrader is a very simple way for them to trade quickly without contacting their financial advisors and executing the trade they want in the moment. Whether we're going to be successful with this marketing campaign and managed to attract larger accounts, I think only time will tell.\nRyan Bailey: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Nancy Stuebe for any further remarks.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on our site tomorrow. Thank you, again, and we will talk to you next quarter-end.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the program of today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but has asked me to present his comments on the business. Also joining us today are Milan Galik, our CEO and Paul Brody, our CFO. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the Company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the Company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ possibly materially from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. I will start today's call with the bad news. In the first half of 2022, circumstances did not evolve in our favor. First, starting at the end of last year, activity diminished in Asia because of China's crackdown on large privately owned companies, and many of our clients from that region suffered outsized losses. Then late in the first quarter, the impact of the war in Ukraine began to be felt on the European economy, chilling the mood of our customers in that region. Finally, early in the second quarter, the delayed response by the Fed to inflationary pressures created fears of a recession in the U.S., sending prices into bear market territory. Deficit spending in the U.S. has limited the government's ability to respond to rising inflation with increasingly higher interest rates. As for each 1% hike, interest on U.S. debt increases by $300 billion as it gets refinanced. So inflation is likely to stay with us. The same difficulty in raising rates in the face of higher inflation and the same causes are also occurring in Europe. Customer losses in their accounts in the markets were substantial. Adding to that, the impact of the withdrawal of all funded accounts by Futu to their own new clearing firm and an introducing broker using a custodial bank while still executing with us, our customers funds diminished by about $80 billion over the past two quarters. In addition, our net new account openings plummeted by about 40% by the end of the quarter. On a brighter note, now for the good news. It seems that many large global financial institutions are looking at the other side of this market valley and are beginning to focus on their client's trading needs. These clients more and more often want to run globally diversified portfolios heavily weighted towards U.S. equities, no matter where they live. Satisfying that demand would necessitate that they consolidate worldwide their often separately and locally developed technology and operations. Several such institutions believe that they can get there sooner by putting their clients on IBKR's platform now and begin working on developing the tools to serve their unique specific client financial needs better. IBKR has reached a positive conclusion in several such discussions. These institutions will onboard their clients gradually and separately by type and location beginning later in the third quarter, while others will start later this year and next. These will be introducing broker accounts unless they will add to our number of accounts. It is for this reason that in spite of our number of net new account openings having declined by 40% by the end of the quarter, I expect this drop to be temporary as the new introducing brokers accounts will begin to show up. Accordingly, I still project long-term account growth of 30%. Most of our technology development capacity in the near future will be devoted to building systems that make our introducing broker and worldwide RIA platforms even more compelling. With this backdrop, we are pleased with how our business performed. We ended the quarter with a record 1,923,000 accounts, a net increase of 36% from last June. We saw account growth at all client segments in all geographic regions with particular strength, 49% and 38% in Europe and Asia, which together represent the majority of our accounts. As our client base grows, DARTs have risen as well. Second quarter total DARTs were strong at over 2.1 million. While trading in the U.S. seems to be holding steady, we began seeing some easing of trading activity in Europe and Asia due to declining markets. Commission per DART rose due to product mix as volumes continue to be strong in futures and options, which carry a higher commission. While in equities, higher commissions per DART were from more active trading and higher priced stocks, which helped boost commissions over last year. Higher futures commissions include very high exchange and regulatory fees, which in part explain our higher execution and clearing direct expense. Higher DARTs and commission per trade led to our total commission revenues rising to $322 million, the third highest in company history and behind only the unusually active trading periods in the first quarters of this year and last. Options and futures volumes continue to be strong. In the second quarter, in the U.S., listed options volume for the industry saw average daily volume of nearly 40 million contracts, one of the highest on record and up 8%. Interactive Brokers options volumes were even stronger, up 11%. Our futures business was even better with our contract volumes up 46% over last year, nearly twice the 25% increase in industry volumes. As inflation can lead to higher commodities prices, investors often use commodity features to participate, especially when there is also volatility in the markets. Interactive Brokers has become better at offering our customers new and innovative products, while also enabling them to navigate through our many high-quality features at ever greater efficiency, helping them to establish their own personalized work environments and tools. Superior customer experience our platform offers continues to be spread by word-of-mouth as well as by our institutional sales team. In uncertain markets, the quality of our capital base matters. Our capital base grew even stronger during this period with total equity reaching $10.6 billion this quarter. This base funds our business and countries around the world, helps us to attract larger customers and reassures clients looking to participate in the markets. We saw account growth once again in all five of the client types that we service. Individual account growth was fastest at 44%, followed by proprietary traders at 32%, introducing brokers at 24%, financial advisers at 15% and hedge funds at 10%. We are always looking to find opportunities and grow our business. We continue to place enhanced focus on our marketing efforts, and we have increased spending in this area from last year. We are letting investors know that Interactive Brokers pays its clients over 1.08% on their cash balances and if the federal reserve raises rates by 75 basis points, then their rate will also rise by 75 basis points to 1.83%. We recently introduced fractional trading in European stocks so our clients can purchase as little as $1 of almost any U.S. or European stock. And in the UK, you can now open a Stocks and Shares ISA. We continue to add to the functionality of our IMPACT app. We have recently added the ability to offset a selection of specific carbon emitting activities, giving clients the ability to offset their footprint and keep track in their statements all from their IBKR account. We still see higher inflation as a catalyst that convinces more people that holding onto their money as cash is a losing proposition. Investing in equities worldwide will be necessary to earn a return and Interactive Brokers will be there with our innovative platform and educational materials. We aim to be the platform of choice for the best-informed, most successful investors and we look forward to welcoming our two millionth customer in the next few months. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through our numbers for the quarter. Paul? Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on our site tomorrow. Thank you, again, and we will talk to you next quarter-end."

            "content": "Thanks, Nancy. Thanks, everyone for joining the call. I will review the second quarter operating results and then we will open it up for questions. Starting with our revenue items on Page 3 of the release, we recorded another strong quarter with increases in net revenues and pre-tax income on an adjusted basis. With customer account growth at 36% year-over-year, we are expanding our potential for both commission and interest revenues in the future. Commissions were strong reaching their third highest quarterly revenue ever at $322 million. Options and futures volumes outpaced the second quarter of 2021 and while stock share volumes declined from last year's quarter, notional value of stock trades actually rose. Net interest income of $348 million reflected higher margin loan interest despite relatively unchanged balances. Thanks to increases in benchmark rates and higher interest earned on our segregated cash portfolio as U.S. rates have moved from an average effective rate of 7 basis points last year to 77 basis points in this year's quarter. These gains were partially offset by higher interest we paid on customer credit balances as we passed through rate hikes above 50 basis points to our customers on their qualified funds. Other fees and services generated $43 million, with market data fees of $19 million, down 5%, and risk exposure fee revenue of $6 million, down 14%. Options exchange liquidity payments $9 million were even with the prior year. Declines in IPO fees and especially in account activity fees, which were discontinued after the second quarter of 2021, reduced the total in this line item. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings. And without these excluded items, other income was positive $4 million for the quarter.  Turning to expenses. Execution, clearing and distribution costs rose 43% from last year led by strong futures volumes, which carry higher fees, lower exchange liquidity rebates, and a smaller clearing fee rebate than in last year's second quarter. As a percent of commission revenues, execution and clearing costs, which are driven by a combination of trading volume, exchange rebates and changing fee schedules, were 18% this quarter, meaning 82% of incremental commission revenue dropped to the bottom line. While this cost ratio fluctuates over time with product mix and trading volumes, the factors that tend to drive it lower over time remain in place, with exchanges offering liquidity rebates and competing on costs, which gives our Smart Router the opportunity to improve on execution quality for our IBKR Pro clients. Compensation and benefits expense, while up in dollar terms for the quarter as we continued to expand hiring to support our strong growth, was 16% of our adjusted net revenues consistent with its historical level. Our headcount at quarter end was 2,780. G&A expenses were up $7 million versus last year on increases in advertising, legal expenses and administrative fees. Our adjusted pre-tax margin was a robust 63%. Automation remains our key means of maintaining high margins as well as continued expense control, while we hire talented people and invest in the future of our business. $32 million of income taxes reflects the sum of the operating company's $16 million and the public company's $16 million. Moving to our balance sheet on Page 5 of the release. Our total assets were $113 billion at the end of the quarter with growth over the last year driven by increases in our segregated cash and securities, partially offset by a reduction in customer margin loans. Our consolidated equity capital was $10.6 billion, and we have no long-term debt. In our operating data on Pages 6 and 7, our contract volumes for all customers were strong, up 11% on the year in options and the second highest ever in futures, up 46%. Stock share volume was down significantly versus last year's active second quarter, and the drop-off is largely attributable to trading in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks. Of note, the notional value of shares traded actually increased over the prior year, reflecting a shift toward trading higher price stocks, which tends to raise the average commission per order. On Page 7, you can see that our account growth remains robust with over 114,000 net accounts added in the quarter and total accounts reaching 1.9 million, up 36% over the prior year. Total customer DARTs were just under 2.2 million trades per day, down 6% from the strong prior year quarter. Our cleared IBKR Pro customers paid an average of $2.74 commission per cleared commissionable order, up 15% from last year as our clients' volume mix included higher per order contributions from stocks and options. Page 8 of the release presents our net interest margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income was $348 million for the quarter, up 27% on the year-ago quarter, reflecting stronger margin loan and segregated cash interest partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates twice in the quarter by 50 basis points in early May and by a further 75 points in June with about two weeks left in a quarter. The latter raise had a minor positive impact in a 12-week quarter, but of course will have a full positive impact in the third quarter. Other regions also raised rates this quarter. This group includes the UK, Canada, Australia and Hong Kong. Margin loan interest was up 54% to $197 million despite average margin loan balances relatively unchanged from last year's second quarter. Higher rates in the U.S. and internationally bode well for our margin interest income. Net interest on segregated cash turned positive in the first quarter. And in the second quarter, we earned $53 million on these balances, primarily due to the two Federal funds \u2013 the Federal Reserve rate hikes, but also to our managing to short duration on invested funds. At June 30, our U.S. portfolio duration was 45 days, for the investments rollover into new higher rates with a fairly short lag time. Securities lending net interest was $116 million, down from the $136 million in the active year-ago quarter although revenue opportunities on hard-to-borrow stocks trended up during the quarter. It's worth noting that while securities lending opportunities maintained a strong pace, it is also the case that as benchmark rates rise, a greater portion of the revenue generated by securities lending is reflected in interest on segregated cash because the cash collateral received is invested as segregated funds. We estimate this impact to be about $10 million for the quarter. Interest on customer credit balances, or the interest we pay our customers is returning to its historical norm as higher rates in many currencies result in our paying interest as we pass through rate increases. We paid $37 million to our customers on these balances in the second quarter. Now for our estimates of the impact of increases in rates. Given market expectations more rate hikes to come, we estimate the effects of increases in the Fed funds rate to produce additional annual net interest income as follows: At 25 basis points, an increase of $57 million annually; at 50 basis points, an increase of $115 million; at 75 basis points, an increase of $172 million; and at 100 basis points, an increase of $229 million. Note that our starting point for these estimates is June 30, with the Fed funds effective rate at 1.58%, and also based on balances at that date. These estimates do not take into account any change in how we may adjust our investment strategy or take advantage of newly higher rates or any change in our assets. About 21% of our customer segregated cash is not in U.S. dollars, so estimates of U.S. rate change impacts exclude those currencies. We estimate a 25 basis point increase in all the relevant non-U.S. benchmark rates would produce additional annual net interest income of about $10 million and that rising to about $40 million at a full 100 basis point increase. In conclusion, we put forward another solid performance in the second quarter, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base, deliver on our core services to customers while continuously adding new features and products and manage the business effectively with strong expense control. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions. Yes. In particular outside the U.S., we are more \u2013 even more constrained to putting client money in banks. We use very large \u2013 the largest of the international banks, but primarily those are the only investments we're permitted to make currently. Yes, sure. I mean that is the 45-day lag, which is why we try to put it out there, so you have the proper expectation of the rollover rate. But yes, given that rates most recently increased in May and June, the full effect has not been held. We have not recorded the full effect yet. And then, of course, the market is projecting further rate increases. And so you can probably assume that our lag time will stay relatively constant. So about 20 something percent and low-20s are actually fully interest rate sensitive, meaning that we \u2013 they fall into categories or account sizes that we don't pay interest on. So we get the full benefit of the rate increases on that portion. [We are actually pass-through] now that interest rates are sufficiently positive in the U.S. We pass through all of the additional rate increases, except on those low \u2013 on those small balances. Right. So the primary factor that went down was \u2013 were the account activity fees because we discontinued them mid last year. So you would not expect to see those, those were $9 million in the last year quarter and $1 million in this quarter. That's a policy change, don't expect that to bounce back. The other changes were quite a bit smaller. Small changes in market data, small changes in exposure fees. Right. Sequentially, the largest factor was actually a drop in the exposure fees. But remember how we think about exposure fees, they're there to help us influence the customers to take less risk in specific ways. We run lots of stress tests that look at different scenarios. And when we find certain kinds of risk that we feel that the standard margin amounts requirements may not be covering in a stress scenario, our system automatically charges exposure fees, which the customer can then decide either to keep the position on and pay the exposure fees to us. These are on overnight position or trim the risk on the position and avoid the exposure fee. So we're not unhappy to see the exposure fees go down because that means we're taking somewhat less risk and that makes us more comfortable. The general factors that I cited greater proportion of futures volume, which has a higher fee base and options as well as opposed to stocks, somewhat lower exchange liquidity rebates, these all combine and cause the aggregate number to not necessarily go hand-in-hand with the volume change or even the commission change. Generally speaking, the larger trends they do go hand-in-hand. But from quarter-to-quarter, we see a different product mix and that can cause these sort of seeming anomalies."

            "content": "As I said, the current account growth is roughly 40% below our average growth over, say the last year and these new types of accounts will start kicking in very, very late this quarter and then gradually more and more of them through the first quarter of next year. So what happened was that when the market collapsed in June, it was right? Yes. So \u2013 or late May, I don't know when the terrible day was. So since that time, the new account fundings are way down, right? And that seems to be continuing strangely. And so I can't really say what will happen with the existing type of business other than to project forward what is going on right now, which is a lower level of account fundings of say about 15% growth. And I expect these new types of accounts to \u2013 as I said to begin coming in very late this quarter and then continuing and gaining speed as we go into next year. So as you know, we have basically five types of accounts and the newer individual accounts tend to be smaller, but the other accounts and the newer introducing broker accounts that tend to be smaller and less productive, but the [SI], hedge fund, prop traders and financial advisors are concerned, they are basically the same. So to the extent that our growth is more pronounced among individual accounts and introducing brokers, yes, overall the new accounts are less productive than the old ones. Thank you. No, we are not. That's the kind of risk that we do not want to take. We will continue to invest in T-bills and repos. Yes. But you have to include what we are paying to the customers, right? You're including that, right? Yes. But if you look at the total balance, we also pay to customers. So that reduces the rate [waver or net] [ph] . Yes we are. Thank you. Hi. Thanks for your question. So we have a number of larger introducing brokers that we are integrating with right now. They are of the larger size. There are three of them. I would not \u2013 I would rather not tell you who they are. They have not publicized the partnership with us either, so we just have to wait for that announcement. All I can tell you is that these are international organizations catering to clients from more than just one country. So this was one large Japanese introducing broker. We love them because they realized that they concentrated too much of their business in a single custodian. They decided to diversify. I think it was a prudent step for them, looking at it from their perspective. So that is what they have done. They currently custody with a provider that is offering them the solution of the trust bank. So that's what they went for. We started marketing the GlobalTrader not that long ago. We have more than 1,000 accounts. We have a lot of downloads. We would like those downloads to turn into more funded account, of course, but the adoption rate is picking up. We are advertising the GlobalTrader to despite the fact that it's a simple trading up that currently allows trading of stocks in cryptocurrencies you would think that it really benefits the most of the retail clients as you can imagine. We are advertising it to larger account holders in the way that we try to appeal to the fact that despite that most of the [affluent] investors finances are managed by financial advisors, we believe that they should be willing to do an occasional trade themselves, and that is what we are advertising to them. But the GlobalTrader is a very simple way for them to trade quickly without contacting their financial advisors and executing the trade they want in the moment. Whether we're going to be successful with this marketing campaign and managed to attract larger accounts, I think only time will tell."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Interactive Brokers Group\u2019 First Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please be advised this call is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Nancy Stuebe, Director of IR. Please go ahead.\nNancy Stuebe: Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas, is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. Also joining us today is Milan Galik, our CEO. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A. As a reminder, today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company\u2019s beliefs regarding future events, which by their nature are not certain and are outside of the company\u2019s control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of Risk Factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. The first quarter was one in which the only thing predictable was how unpredictable it would be except for our continued growth. In the first three months of this year, the markets absorbed news on geopolitical issues that included the war in Europe and its impacts, both humanitarian and economic, as well as continuing supply chain issues, product shortages, levels of inflation not seen since the 1970s and the first Fed funds rate hike since 2018, with expectations of many more to come. Persistent deficit spending in this country has limited the government\u2019s ability to respond to high inflation with high interest rates. As for each 1% rise, interest on U.S. debt increases by $300 billion as it gets refinanced. So inflation is likely to stay with us. Few markets were unaffected by these events and most market indices worldwide were down in the first quarter. Despite this, we are very pleased with how our business performed even with the headwinds we faced in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a record 1,809,000 accounts and that increase of over 480,000 from last March. We saw account growth in all client segments and all geographic regions, with particular strength 40% and 48% in Europe and Asia, which together represent three quarters of our accounts. As our client base grows, DARTs have risen as well. In the first quarter our DARTs were over 2.5 million, the second highest in our company\u2019s history. Volumes are up, particularly this quarter in futures and options. Products which carry a higher commission, so in the case of futures, they also carry a higher cost, with 56% of futures commissions taken up by exchange, clearing and regulatory fees, likely due to a lack of competition in the largest futures market in the U.S. Higher DARTs led to commission revenues rising to $349 million, also the second highest in company history, behind only the unusually active trading period last year. As I mentioned on our fourth quarter call option, volumes continue to be strong. In the first quarter in the U.S., listed options volume for the industry, the average daily volume of over 42 million contracts a record. In an unpredictable environment, vertical option spreads give traders the ability to take on a very specific and limited risk reward profile for a specific period of time. This appeals to many traders looking to invest in companies, whose business and prospects they believe in at less cost than if they had to buy those shares outright. While in 2022 the impact of the coronavirus has faded, the resulting reliance by the public on electronic communications, meeting from a distance and gathering and sharing ideas and larger asynchronous groups, including groups of investors, remains. The net effect of this trend as far as IBKR in the online brokerage industry is concerned, is that even millennial, analysts technologically oriented people have become more friendly with online activities. As you may know, the average age of our customers is 42. Unexpectedly, this opens up a new segment of potential customers for us, 50 and above wealthier people. Most of these people have their investments managed by advisors on the conventional wealth management platforms of the larger brokers. Now that they are at ease with online activities, many of them would like to be able to see their accounts live online and sometimes would even like to do a trade by themselves and see it landing in their accounts. At Interactive Brokers, this is something they can do. Our task is to let them know that, so that they would ask their advisors to move their accounts to IBKR. Interactive Brokers has become better at enabling our customers to navigate through our numerous high-quality features at ever greater efficiency, helping them to establish their own personalized work environments and tools. The superior customer experience our platform offers has become better known worldwide, spread by word of mouth, as well as by our institutional sales team, as we continue to add customers at a rate of over 30%. In addition, our capital base has grown even stronger during this period, with total equity reaching $10.5 billion this quarter, up $1 billion since this time last year. This space funds our business, helps us to attract larger customers and reassures the increasing number of clients looking to participate in the markets. We saw account growth once again in all five of the client types that we service. Individual account growth was fastest at 45%, followed by proprietary traders at 35%, introducing brokers at 23%, financial advisors at 16% and hedge funds at 8%. We are excited about the opportunities we see in 2022. We continue to place enhanced focus on our marketing efforts and we increased spending in this area over the past year and expect to continue again this year. We recently introduced Global Trader, a simple mobile trading app that allows investors to open an account in minutes, and start trading on over 80 stock exchanges around the world and 23 different currencies, allowing for global diversification. It is integrated with our GlobalAnalyst Scanner, which helps investors identify investment opportunities worldwide, allowing Global Trader users to quickly take advantage of them. We also started Traders\u2019 Insight Radio, a new podcast series featuring interviews with thought leaders across financial services and that is available for free on our Trader Workstation, Client Portal and IBKR mobile, as well as via the popular podcasting services. Our leading ESG efforts continue and now include carbon offsets. Our clients can select from a list of pre-set activities, estimate our carbon footprint and purchase the carbon credits to offset them, which we source and retire all from their IBKR account. We believe in 2022 with the potential for higher inflation that more people will come to the realization that holding on to their money as cash is a losing proposition. They will turn to equities worldwide to earn a return and Interactive Brokers will serve them with their innovative platform and educational materials. We aim to be the platform of choice for the best informed, most successful investors. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul?\nPaul Brody: Thank you, Nancy, and as usual, thanks, everyone, for joining the call. I will first review the first quarter operating results and then we will open it up for questions. Starting with our revenue items on page three of the release, we are pleased with the strength of our results this quarter and we believe our robust growth in customer accounts positions us well for both commission and interest revenues in the quarters ahead. Commissions were strong, reaching their second highest quarterly revenue ever at $349 million. Options and futures volumes outpaced the first quarter of 2021, while stock volumes declined from last year\u2019s so called meme stock spike. Net interest income of $282 million reflected higher margin loan interest on greater loan balances, as well as higher interest earned on our segregated cash portfolio as U.S. rates have recently moved up from near zero. These gains were offset by lower securities lending revenue, which reflected fewer opportunities in the marketplace. Other fees and services generated $53 million, with market data fees of $20 million, up 5% and risk exposure fee revenue tripling to $15 million. Exchange liquidity payments remained at $10 million on consistent options volume. Declines in IPO fees and account activity fees, which we discontinued for the most account types in 2021 reduced the total in this line item. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transaction. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings, and without these excluded items, other income was $8 million for the quarter. Turning to expenses, execution, clearing and distribution costs rose 4% from last year, led by futures volumes, which carry higher fees. As a percentage -- as a percent of commission revenues, execution and clearing costs, which are driven by a combination of trading volume, exchange rebates and changing fee schedules were 16% this quarter, meaning that 84% of incremental commission revenue dropped to the bottomline. While this cost ratio will fluctuate over time with product mix and trading volumes, the factors that drive it lower over time remain in place, with exchanges offering rebates on compete -- and competing on cost, which gives our smart router the opportunity to improve on execution quality for our IBKR Pro clients. Compensation and benefits expense while up in dollar terms for the quarter as we expanded hiring to support our strong growth was 16% of our adjusted net revenues consistent with its historical level. Our headcount at quarter-end was 2,683. G&A expenses were down versus last year, driven by a non-recurrence of $18 million in Brexit-related costs and lower legal expenses. This quarter also included a $1 million donation toward humanitarian aid in Ukraine. Our adjusted pre-tax margin was a robust 64%. Automation remains our key means of maintaining high margins as well as continued expense control, while we hire talented people and invest in the future of our business. $28 million of income taxes reflect the sum of the operating companies $11 million and the public companies $17 million. Moving to our balance sheet on page five of the release, our total assets were $114 billion at the end of the quarter, with growth over the last year, driven by increases in our segregated cash and securities and margin loans. Our consolidated equity capital was $10.5 billion and we have no long-term debt. Turning to our operating data on pages six and seven, our contract volumes for all customers were especially strong, reaching the second highest ever in options up 6% on the year and the highest ever in futures up 31% on the year. Stock share volume was down significantly versus last year\u2019s active first quarter and the drop-off is largely attributable to trading in pink sheet and other very low priced stocks. On page seven, you can see that our account growth remains robust with over 132,000 net account adds in the quarter and total accounts reaching 1.8 million, up 36% over the prior year. We are now adding accounts at a quarterly pace that is greater than our annual pace prior to 2020. Total customer DARTs were over 2.5 million trades per day, second highest in company history, surpassed only by last year\u2019s extreme first quarter activity, but up 4% from strong fourth quarter trends. Our cleared IBKR Pro customers paid an average of $2.57 commission per cleared commissionable order, up 11% from last year, as our clients\u2019 volume mix included proportionately more futures than last year. These products carry higher pass-through fees charged by exchanges and clearinghouses. Page eight presents our net interest margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income was $282 million for the quarter, down 8% on the year ago quarter, reflecting strength in margin lending offset by fewer opportunities in securities lending. The Federal Reserve raise interest rates by 25 basis points with about two weeks left in the quarter, which had a minor positive impact in a 12 week quarter, but we will have a full positive impact in the next quarter. Margin on net interest was up 27% to $149 million as average margin loan balances grew 18% over last year\u2019s first quarter. The higher Fed funds rate bodes well for our U.S. dollar denominated balances, which are roughly three quarters of the total. Net interest on segregated cash turned positive this quarter and we earned $7 million on this balances due both to our opportunistic investment strategy, as well as the mid-March Federal Reserve rate hike. Securities lending net interest was $110 million, down from $175 million in the unusually active year ago quarter. There were fewer hard to borrow names that investors sold short in the first couple of months of the quarter, particularly in January and early February, that we began to see more opportunities open up in March. Interest from customer credit balances or the interest we pay our customers continues to be positive, because in currencies where rates are negative, we pass-through some of the interest cost to customers. We earned $9 million on these balances. Now for our estimates the impact of increases in interest rates, we expect the next 25-basis-point rise in rates to produce an additional $124 million annually. Note that our starting point for this estimate is March 31st, when the first 25 basis point increase in Fed funds had already occurred. The $124 million estimate is for a second rate increase and is in addition to the $165 million increase for the first rate hike that we estimated last quarter. As current market expectations include larger rate increases, we note that a 50-basis-point rise in rates would produce an additional $175 million annually. This does not take into account any change in how we may adjust our investment strategy to take advantage of newly higher rates or any change in our asset. About 28% of our customer cash balances are non-U.S. dollars. So estimates of U.S. rate changes -- rate change impact exclude those currencies. In conclusion, the first quarter produced a solid start to the year, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base, take advantage of opportunities as they arise, while managing the business effectively with strong expense control. And with that, we will turn it over to the moderator and we will open up for questions.\nOperator: And thank you.  And our first question comes from Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nRich Repetto: Hi. Good evening, Thomas, and good evening, Paul. I guess the first question has to do with the -- just trying to understand, Paul, the interest rate sensitivity you just went through. When you say the next 50 basis points that we have had rate hike one, and then the second one would be 124, this 50 basis points can we consider that, this year it looks like there\u2019s going to be at least the Fed continues to forecast an eight additional. So would that be hikes, what do you call three through eight, could we apply that sort of sensitivity?\nPaul Brody: Right. So we haven\u2019t mapped it all the way out. But I can tell you that the incremental numbers stabilize after maybe about three rate hikes and that\u2019s because the rates are high enough that we are now paying customers credit -- interest on their credit balances and so we are earning our spread. And the incremental amount we earn as the rates go up is on what we call fully interest rate sensitive balances. In other words, balances that on which customer customers are not earning and after about three rate hikes of 25 basis points. That levels out at about $50 million incrementally per year for each 25 basis point increase.\nRich Repetto: Got it. That\u2019s very helpful.\nPaul Brody: So we had $124 million. Now we are looking at the incremental that I said 50 basis points that that $175 million was equivalent to the $124 million would be for 25 basis points, $175 million would be for 50 basis points, hence about $50 million extra for that next 25 basis points.\nRich Repetto: Got it. That\u2019s the clarification is helpful. Good evening, Thomas. I just want to get your view, people are trying to understand and grasp where the retail investor is. And it looks like if I had to -- if you could sort of guide us, it looks like the more sophisticated trader is still pretty strong, given the size of your trades went up and a little bit more tilted towards futures. Would you size up retail engagement, who is trading these days and is it sort of bifurcating between the sophisticated and sort of some of the newer investors we saw in the first quarter of last year?\nThomas Peterffy: So aside of the semi sophisticated, the more sophisticated I think are just -- are trading away, they basically tend to focus more and more on options and within that they tend to do more and more vertical spreads. And what we like about vertical spreads, of course, is that it\u2019s a valid strategy just as much in down markets as it is in up market. So we expect that even if the market starts going down, we will not suffer too heavily from lack of trading.\nRich Repetto: Okay. I got a follow up questions, but I will get back in the queue. Thanks, Thomas.\nOperator: And thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey. Good evening, everyone.\nPaul Brody: Hi, Craig.\nThomas Peterffy: Good evening.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good evening, Thomas. So in the prepared remarks, Paul you commented, how much stronger the organic growth rate is today versus before 2020 and that\u2019s continuing here into a more challenging backdrop in 1Q. Overall, what do you attribute this to, and Thomas, I know you have had a target out there, I believe around 40% going forward. But what gives you conviction and confidence that this strong organic growth trajectory will continue here?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, I think my target was 30%. But so I certainly don\u2019t believe that we will get 40%. It\u2019s possible but extremely unlikely. And I will be very happy with 30% account growth and the event that is -- those new accounts as we keep going over that fact the new accounts tend to be somewhat smaller although we do have several prospect, a larger prospect in the pipeline, but they tend to be basically in the introducing brokers space and they are likely to be more and more omnibus accounts. In other words when they join us they will not show up in the account bills. So, somebody could join us, with say, 100,000 accounts, but it will just show up as one account, because it is going to be one omnibus account.\nCraig Siegenthaler: That makes sense. And then just turning to capital return, you have $10.5 billion of equity capital now. Is there a level where you can accelerate the return of capital to shareholders and is one reason you have so much capital, also because you are trying to win hedge fund prime business where the size of the balance sheet is critical?\nThomas Peterffy: You are absolutely right. We are going to keep on accumulating capital and firming up our credibility in the eyes of the investing public.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Just want to clarify, Paul, one thing on the rate sensitivity. So, in addition to what you said for the next two hikes, but every 25-basis-point hike after, what would be the first three, it will be a $50 million benefit, is that the way to think of it?\nPaul Brody: Roughly. But, of course that\u2019s assuming no change in balances and if our balances grow over time, those numbers will go up.\nDan Fannon: Right. And given you haven\u2019t changed your investment philosophy, but obviously, the backdrop for rates is a lot different today than it was three months ago. How are you thinking about that potentially as the year progresses and rate backdrop changes, should we see a shift or should we anticipate a shift in investment strategy based upon that backdrop?\nThomas Peterffy: No. No. So, look, I very strongly believe that that fed rate hike will have to go much higher due to slow down inflation. Let\u2019s basically be still a negative 8%, right? So I think that just going up 2% or 3% and being at negative 6% or 5% is not going to be good enough. So I think that rates could go as high as 4% or 5% and we are not going to lend the money for any further down for that very, very short-term.\nDan Fannon: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. And our next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is now open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi. I just want to clarify. I think, Nancy, you mentioned that, Milan has joined the call for the -- is that correct, is he on?\nMilan Galik: That\u2019s correct. Hi, Kyle.\nKyle Voigt: Hi. Welcome to the call.\nMilan Galik: Thank you.\nKyle Voigt: Just because you haven\u2019t historically had, I guess, much exposure to IBKR investors in this forum before. Just wondering, if you could share a few, maybe high level thoughts on the state of the business, what opportunities you are spending the most time on operationally and then what segments or initiatives that kind of excite you the most as you look out over the next three years or five years for the company?\nMilan Galik: So thanks for your question. I feel like Interactive Brokers is firing on all cylinders. We have a lot of projects that we are currently working on. We are still spending quite a bit of time on increasing our scalability. Our goal is to be able to service 10 million accounts, 10 million trade per day. We are getting close to be able to hit those numbers. So scalability continues to be part of our work. We focus on the retail investors, as you might have seen, we have released the Impact app not that long ago. We have put online the Global Trader, which we just started marketing. So we are doing work that should appeal to the most retail client if you will. There is a substantial amount of effort we are putting into servicing the financial advisors. We are making it easier for them to onboard their clients. We are making it easier for them to service those clients. We are going to be gradually allowing the financial advisors to do more work for their clients than we previously allowed. Our salesforce is doing a great job in getting us institutional accounts, for example, the high broker accounts, introducing brokers accounts. So we have a few in the pipeline that we are going to be on-boarding this year. We are working on a facelift of our MobileTrader. We are designing a brand new desktop trading platform. And I could go on, we are going to be adding products as we usually do. We are going to be adding new geographies for our international traders.\nKyle Voigt: That\u2019s great color. Thank you for -- thanks for that and welcome again. I guess for a follow up question, maybe for Paul on the expense side. I think fixed expenses in aggregate were $179 million in the first quarter. We compare that to the first quarter of last year and even excluding the, I think, $19 million or so of one-time Brexit expenses last year, the fixed expense growth rate was still only 8% or so year-on-year, which is lower than your historical growth rate, as well as I think the guidance range, which is closer to that 15% type range for fixed expenses. So just wondering how we should think about year-on-year growth in fixed expenses as we move through the remainder of this year?\nPaul Brody: So by design, we have been increasing staff to accommodate our growing business, especially in client services, but also we have ramped up compliance over the last several years, so that\u2019s by design. And so when you see those numbers increasing, we are expecting that and in fact we are hitting our targets I think. And really the rest are fairly stable, when you see the G&A go up and down, it\u2019s because there\u2019s items in there that come and go. As we mentioned, it was about $18 million that we spent last year related to Brexit we are getting regulated in Europe that didn\u2019t repeat this year and those numbers came way off. So it\u2019s a little hard to pin down the overall growth rate. But probably the largest contributor may continue to be the employee compensation and benefits.\nKyle Voigt: Got it. So it seems like this type of growth rate is fairly good too soon for the remainder of the year is that fair, is it now high-single digits or low-double digits, just trying to get a sense of the growth rate we should be assuming in our models?\nThomas Peterffy: I think that that low-double digits are closer to the target than the high-single digits. So we are continue to\u2026\nKyle Voigt: Okay.\nThomas Peterffy: We are continue to expand in customer service and in the number of geographies where we are establishing subsidiaries. So I would think that the $15 -- 15% increase is probably a good guess.\nKyle Voigt: Great. Thanks, Thomas. I will hop back in the queue. Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. And our next question comes from Chris Allen from Compass Point. Your line is now open.\nChris Allen: Good evening, everyone. Thank you for my questions. I wanted to ask about the yields on margin balances, so a nice increase sequentially in year-over-year. I know you had some pricing changes in there. I am just wondering if you could parse out what was driven by pricing changes and also what was driven by the recent Fed hike?\nThomas Peterffy: So what we used to do in quite a long time ago was that our margin rates were between a 0.5 point and 1.5 points over Fed funds. We have increased the bottom of that so that we are between 75 basis points and 1.5 points -- 150 basis points over Fed fund. That\u2019s the only change we have made.\nChris Allen: Understood. Does that impact on the full quarter?\nThomas Peterffy: Sorry?\nChris Allen: Does that impact fell through this whole first quarter?\nThomas Peterffy: Oh! Yes.\nPaul Brody: Yeah.\nThomas Peterffy: Yeah. Thank you.\nChris Allen: And then maybe a quick one, just on execution and clearing costs. In addition to higher futures activity, the loss of the OCC fee waiver going away that that impacted, was that also a factor just in higher execution clearing costs relative to where they had been running?\nPaul Brody: I am sorry. Can you repeat that, Chris?\nChris Allen: Yeah. I mean, trying to figure out through the execution and clearing costs, obviously, ramped higher from where it had been running, you attributed some of that to futures activity, but the OCC fee waiver which had a bit effect for the tail end of 2021 that went away. So, just trying to figure out the differences between the two, what\u2019s the driving factor there?\nPaul Brody: Yes. Most of it was driven by the futures. There was an impact from the OCC fee holiday at the end of the year coming back. It didn\u2019t come back at the full rate that they started last year at. Last year they started a higher rate, dropped it toward the middle of the year and then put a fee holiday on for part of the end of the year. They reinstated it around somewhere in the middle, which is probably reasonable for them because they are doing such higher volume now, that impact was something like $3 million to $4 million in the quarter over the prior quarter.\nChris Allen: Understood. Thank. I will be back in queue.\nOperator: And thank you. And we have a follow up question from Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nRich Repetto: Yeah. Hello again. Now that we know, we have Milan on the call as well. I wanted to get a question in for him as well, Milan. So, Thomas has placed, I guess, the highest priority, the highest standard of technology driving Interactive Brokers success. And I guess, from your standpoint, which are the areas in technology really differentiate? Can you talk about your platform of how you see the platform and how it sets you apart from some of your peers?\nMilan Galik: Hi, Rich. Thanks for the question. I think what sets us apart is the fact that I view our company as a technology company that applies its skill set to the financial industry. So we have a lot of programmers, a lot of technologists working for the company. As you may know, Interactive Brokers started as an options market making firm and what we were doing was building computer systems for trading options at the various exchanges. So our mindset is technology. That is how we approach the problems. We look at workflows, the task flows that our clients have to execute on the platform and we ask ourselves the question how can we automate the process that they are executing? How can we make the process the most intuitive and the simplest for them? So that is our nature. We obviously have a very strong sales force, but at the core we are a tech company and I believe that\u2019s what sets us apart the high level of automation, which you can clearly see in the 65%-plus profit margin that we are running as a company. And that will never change, that is what we are counting on going forwards, building new features for our clients, reviving the older ones, increasing the stability and scalability of our systems. That is what we are into. That is what we will continue to do.\nRich Repetto: Understood. Very helpful. And I got one last one for Thomas, getting back to the retail investor, Thomas. So we did see some deleveraging or margin balances contracting a bit in a couple of months, I believe. And just trying to understand, we saw futures go up. We have seen the Russia, Ukraine, you know event sort of stall, I guess. So it appears that, there was a lot of trading maybe in February on -- with derivatives, but it seems like it\u2019s more stalled now. And just trying to understand who -- again, who\u2019s trading as we get into this period, if market conditions pretty much stay the same for the next couple of quarters.\nThomas Peterffy: So, look, I mean, the way it works for us, is sad for our customers practically another three . So something like 52% of the customers do three or less trades a year. Fed that up against the remaining 48%, where the average customer with $100,000 in assets in these accounts creates 230 times a year. And from there on, for every 60% increase in funds in the account, the trading volume doubles and it\u2019s surprisingly a very straight line.\nRich Repetto: Okay. So as the -- your sophisticated traders are semi-sophisticated traders, the ones with more assets are more active?\nThomas Peterffy: You are right.\nRich Repetto: Okay. That was it. All right. Thanks. It was helpful.\nThomas Peterffy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you.  And we have a follow-up question from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks for taking the follow-up. I had a question on the mix of new account growth with the 133 million accounts by geography. Any commentary on what it looked like on the way in and I wasn\u2019t particularly interested in Asia and Eastern Europe and also any commentary on clients closing accounts or redemptions in the other side of that?\nThomas Peterffy: So, we didn\u2019t really have redemptions other than the Futu and Tiger broker going away, right? And there were some European introducing brokers who were extremely active in last year and they have -- their activity has drastically diminished this year. But -- so -- what is -- tell me again, what is it that you would exactly try to find out?\nCraig Siegenthaler: I just wanted to understand what the inflow looked like by geography, if there was any regions that were out hitting their weight?\nThomas Peterffy: Inflow by geography, well, it\u2019s basically due to the -- so I am looking at the annual numbers here and I -- and due to the, as I said, the going away of Futu and Tiger. Our inflow from Asia is basically unchanged for the year, while in the -- for the Americas, Americas it\u2019s up 11% and from Europe it\u2019s up 17%, so that\u2019s roughly, those are the numbers.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Thomas. And I\u2019d have follow up to Kyle\u2019s question on expenses. But last year the operating margin was high at 67%. It was a good commission backdrop. This quarter it dip to 64%. You talked about expense growth I think in the low double digit zone. But also how should we think about operating leverage? Should we really think about the margin really capped kind of in the high 60%s and really a ceiling where we are here?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, we find it very difficult to COVID hurdle. We keep thinking that one of these days the growth will just exceed the continues hunger to build new things and the growth on the backbone that we have built up to that point is going to exceed the continuing spending the new investments. But we haven\u2019t seen that happen yet. So we just keep thinking that may happen in the future, but it hasn\u2019t so far and it certainly is not likely to happen this year, maybe later on.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Thomas.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have a follow up from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is now open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi. Excuse me. Thank you for taking my follow-up. I guess a follow up question for Milan, you spoke about how IBKR has been and always will be a technology-first firm, but the company has also been putting a lot more focus on marketing and the prepared remarks you spoke about growing the marketing spend. Just wondering, if you could talk a little bit more about the marketing strategy, the shift in that strategy over the past couple of years, it seems like there\u2019s certainly more emphasis on that now and then. The trajectory, I guess, in terms of the marketing spend as we look ahead beyond this year, over the medium-term? Thank you.\nMilan Galik: So marketing is obviously extremely important. It doesn\u2019t matter what kind of technology we build for our clients and how a low cost provider we are, if we don\u2019t tell anybody about it. So we have to explain ourselves very well and make ourselves attractive to the investors. So marketing is extremely important. We have been increasing our marketing spend, but we have been doing it gradually and responsibly. At all times we pay a lot of attention at what type of return we receive from the various marketing channels and the ones that work for us well, we put more money into and the ones that do not pan out, do not work well enough, we take our spending back and this will gradually continue.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Nancy Stuebe for closing remarks.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you everyone for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again and we will talk to you next quarter end.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Nancy Stuebe",
            "content": "Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas, is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. Also joining us today is Milan Galik, our CEO. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's beliefs regarding future events, which by their nature are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of Risk Factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. The first quarter was one in which the only thing predictable was how unpredictable it would be except for our continued growth. In the first three months of this year, the markets absorbed news on geopolitical issues that included the war in Europe and its impacts, both humanitarian and economic, as well as continuing supply chain issues, product shortages, levels of inflation not seen since the 1970s and the first Fed funds rate hike since 2018, with expectations of many more to come. Persistent deficit spending in this country has limited the government's ability to respond to high inflation with high interest rates. As for each 1% rise, interest on U.S. debt increases by $300 billion as it gets refinanced. So inflation is likely to stay with us. Few markets were unaffected by these events and most market indices worldwide were down in the first quarter. Despite this, we are very pleased with how our business performed even with the headwinds we faced in the quarter. We ended the quarter with a record 1,809,000 accounts and that increase of over 480,000 from last March. We saw account growth in all client segments and all geographic regions, with particular strength 40% and 48% in Europe and Asia, which together represent three quarters of our accounts. As our client base grows, DARTs have risen as well. In the first quarter our DARTs were over 2.5 million, the second highest in our company's history. Volumes are up, particularly this quarter in futures and options. Products which carry a higher commission, so in the case of futures, they also carry a higher cost, with 56% of futures commissions taken up by exchange, clearing and regulatory fees, likely due to a lack of competition in the largest futures market in the U.S. Higher DARTs led to commission revenues rising to $349 million, also the second highest in company history, behind only the unusually active trading period last year. As I mentioned on our fourth quarter call option, volumes continue to be strong. In the first quarter in the U.S., listed options volume for the industry, the average daily volume of over 42 million contracts a record. In an unpredictable environment, vertical option spreads give traders the ability to take on a very specific and limited risk reward profile for a specific period of time. This appeals to many traders looking to invest in companies, whose business and prospects they believe in at less cost than if they had to buy those shares outright. While in 2022 the impact of the coronavirus has faded, the resulting reliance by the public on electronic communications, meeting from a distance and gathering and sharing ideas and larger asynchronous groups, including groups of investors, remains. The net effect of this trend as far as IBKR in the online brokerage industry is concerned, is that even millennial, analysts technologically oriented people have become more friendly with online activities. As you may know, the average age of our customers is 42. Unexpectedly, this opens up a new segment of potential customers for us, 50 and above wealthier people. Most of these people have their investments managed by advisors on the conventional wealth management platforms of the larger brokers. Now that they are at ease with online activities, many of them would like to be able to see their accounts live online and sometimes would even like to do a trade by themselves and see it landing in their accounts. At Interactive Brokers, this is something they can do. Our task is to let them know that, so that they would ask their advisors to move their accounts to IBKR. Interactive Brokers has become better at enabling our customers to navigate through our numerous high-quality features at ever greater efficiency, helping them to establish their own personalized work environments and tools. The superior customer experience our platform offers has become better known worldwide, spread by word of mouth, as well as by our institutional sales team, as we continue to add customers at a rate of over 30%. In addition, our capital base has grown even stronger during this period, with total equity reaching $10.5 billion this quarter, up $1 billion since this time last year. This space funds our business, helps us to attract larger customers and reassures the increasing number of clients looking to participate in the markets. We saw account growth once again in all five of the client types that we service. Individual account growth was fastest at 45%, followed by proprietary traders at 35%, introducing brokers at 23%, financial advisors at 16% and hedge funds at 8%. We are excited about the opportunities we see in 2022. We continue to place enhanced focus on our marketing efforts and we increased spending in this area over the past year and expect to continue again this year. We recently introduced Global Trader, a simple mobile trading app that allows investors to open an account in minutes, and start trading on over 80 stock exchanges around the world and 23 different currencies, allowing for global diversification. It is integrated with our GlobalAnalyst Scanner, which helps investors identify investment opportunities worldwide, allowing Global Trader users to quickly take advantage of them. We also started Traders' Insight Radio, a new podcast series featuring interviews with thought leaders across financial services and that is available for free on our Trader Workstation, Client Portal and IBKR mobile, as well as via the popular podcasting services. Our leading ESG efforts continue and now include carbon offsets. Our clients can select from a list of pre-set activities, estimate our carbon footprint and purchase the carbon credits to offset them, which we source and retire all from their IBKR account. We believe in 2022 with the potential for higher inflation that more people will come to the realization that holding on to their money as cash is a losing proposition. They will turn to equities worldwide to earn a return and Interactive Brokers will serve them with their innovative platform and educational materials. We aim to be the platform of choice for the best informed, most successful investors. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul? Thank you everyone for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again and we will talk to you next quarter end."

            "name": "Paul Brody",
            "content": "Thank you, Nancy, and as usual, thanks, everyone, for joining the call. I will first review the first quarter operating results and then we will open it up for questions. Starting with our revenue items on page three of the release, we are pleased with the strength of our results this quarter and we believe our robust growth in customer accounts positions us well for both commission and interest revenues in the quarters ahead. Commissions were strong, reaching their second highest quarterly revenue ever at $349 million. Options and futures volumes outpaced the first quarter of 2021, while stock volumes declined from last year's so called meme stock spike. Net interest income of $282 million reflected higher margin loan interest on greater loan balances, as well as higher interest earned on our segregated cash portfolio as U.S. rates have recently moved up from near zero. These gains were offset by lower securities lending revenue, which reflected fewer opportunities in the marketplace. Other fees and services generated $53 million, with market data fees of $20 million, up 5% and risk exposure fee revenue tripling to $15 million. Exchange liquidity payments remained at $10 million on consistent options volume. Declines in IPO fees and account activity fees, which we discontinued for the most account types in 2021 reduced the total in this line item. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transaction. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings, and without these excluded items, other income was $8 million for the quarter. Turning to expenses, execution, clearing and distribution costs rose 4% from last year, led by futures volumes, which carry higher fees. As a percentage -- as a percent of commission revenues, execution and clearing costs, which are driven by a combination of trading volume, exchange rebates and changing fee schedules were 16% this quarter, meaning that 84% of incremental commission revenue dropped to the bottomline. While this cost ratio will fluctuate over time with product mix and trading volumes, the factors that drive it lower over time remain in place, with exchanges offering rebates on compete -- and competing on cost, which gives our smart router the opportunity to improve on execution quality for our IBKR Pro clients. Compensation and benefits expense while up in dollar terms for the quarter as we expanded hiring to support our strong growth was 16% of our adjusted net revenues consistent with its historical level. Our headcount at quarter-end was 2,683. G&A expenses were down versus last year, driven by a non-recurrence of $18 million in Brexit-related costs and lower legal expenses. This quarter also included a $1 million donation toward humanitarian aid in Ukraine. Our adjusted pre-tax margin was a robust 64%. Automation remains our key means of maintaining high margins as well as continued expense control, while we hire talented people and invest in the future of our business. $28 million of income taxes reflect the sum of the operating companies $11 million and the public companies $17 million. Moving to our balance sheet on page five of the release, our total assets were $114 billion at the end of the quarter, with growth over the last year, driven by increases in our segregated cash and securities and margin loans. Our consolidated equity capital was $10.5 billion and we have no long-term debt. Turning to our operating data on pages six and seven, our contract volumes for all customers were especially strong, reaching the second highest ever in options up 6% on the year and the highest ever in futures up 31% on the year. Stock share volume was down significantly versus last year's active first quarter and the drop-off is largely attributable to trading in pink sheet and other very low priced stocks. On page seven, you can see that our account growth remains robust with over 132,000 net account adds in the quarter and total accounts reaching 1.8 million, up 36% over the prior year. We are now adding accounts at a quarterly pace that is greater than our annual pace prior to 2020. Total customer DARTs were over 2.5 million trades per day, second highest in company history, surpassed only by last year's extreme first quarter activity, but up 4% from strong fourth quarter trends. Our cleared IBKR Pro customers paid an average of $2.57 commission per cleared commissionable order, up 11% from last year, as our clients' volume mix included proportionately more futures than last year. These products carry higher pass-through fees charged by exchanges and clearinghouses. Page eight presents our net interest margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income was $282 million for the quarter, down 8% on the year ago quarter, reflecting strength in margin lending offset by fewer opportunities in securities lending. The Federal Reserve raise interest rates by 25 basis points with about two weeks left in the quarter, which had a minor positive impact in a 12 week quarter, but we will have a full positive impact in the next quarter. Margin on net interest was up 27% to $149 million as average margin loan balances grew 18% over last year's first quarter. The higher Fed funds rate bodes well for our U.S. dollar denominated balances, which are roughly three quarters of the total. Net interest on segregated cash turned positive this quarter and we earned $7 million on this balances due both to our opportunistic investment strategy, as well as the mid-March Federal Reserve rate hike. Securities lending net interest was $110 million, down from $175 million in the unusually active year ago quarter. There were fewer hard to borrow names that investors sold short in the first couple of months of the quarter, particularly in January and early February, that we began to see more opportunities open up in March. Interest from customer credit balances or the interest we pay our customers continues to be positive, because in currencies where rates are negative, we pass-through some of the interest cost to customers. We earned $9 million on these balances. Now for our estimates the impact of increases in interest rates, we expect the next 25-basis-point rise in rates to produce an additional $124 million annually. Note that our starting point for this estimate is March 31st, when the first 25 basis point increase in Fed funds had already occurred. The $124 million estimate is for a second rate increase and is in addition to the $165 million increase for the first rate hike that we estimated last quarter. As current market expectations include larger rate increases, we note that a 50-basis-point rise in rates would produce an additional $175 million annually. This does not take into account any change in how we may adjust our investment strategy to take advantage of newly higher rates or any change in our asset. About 28% of our customer cash balances are non-U.S. dollars. So estimates of U.S. rate changes -- rate change impact exclude those currencies. In conclusion, the first quarter produced a solid start to the year, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base, take advantage of opportunities as they arise, while managing the business effectively with strong expense control. And with that, we will turn it over to the moderator and we will open up for questions. Right. So we haven't mapped it all the way out. But I can tell you that the incremental numbers stabilize after maybe about three rate hikes and that's because the rates are high enough that we are now paying customers credit -- interest on their credit balances and so we are earning our spread. And the incremental amount we earn as the rates go up is on what we call fully interest rate sensitive balances. In other words, balances that on which customer customers are not earning and after about three rate hikes of 25 basis points. That levels out at about $50 million incrementally per year for each 25 basis point increase. So we had $124 million. Now we are looking at the incremental that I said 50 basis points that that $175 million was equivalent to the $124 million would be for 25 basis points, $175 million would be for 50 basis points, hence about $50 million extra for that next 25 basis points. Hi, Craig. Roughly. But, of course that's assuming no change in balances and if our balances grow over time, those numbers will go up. So by design, we have been increasing staff to accommodate our growing business, especially in client services, but also we have ramped up compliance over the last several years, so that's by design. And so when you see those numbers increasing, we are expecting that and in fact we are hitting our targets I think. And really the rest are fairly stable, when you see the G&A go up and down, it's because there's items in there that come and go. As we mentioned, it was about $18 million that we spent last year related to Brexit we are getting regulated in Europe that didn't repeat this year and those numbers came way off. So it's a little hard to pin down the overall growth rate. But probably the largest contributor may continue to be the employee compensation and benefits. Yeah. I am sorry. Can you repeat that, Chris? Yes. Most of it was driven by the futures. There was an impact from the OCC fee holiday at the end of the year coming back. It didn't come back at the full rate that they started last year at. Last year they started a higher rate, dropped it toward the middle of the year and then put a fee holiday on for part of the end of the year. They reinstated it around somewhere in the middle, which is probably reasonable for them because they are doing such higher volume now, that impact was something like $3 million to $4 million in the quarter over the prior quarter."

            "name": "Thomas Peterffy",
            "content": "So aside of the semi sophisticated, the more sophisticated I think are just -- are trading away, they basically tend to focus more and more on options and within that they tend to do more and more vertical spreads. And what we like about vertical spreads, of course, is that it's a valid strategy just as much in down markets as it is in up market. So we expect that even if the market starts going down, we will not suffer too heavily from lack of trading. Good evening. Well, I think my target was 30%. But so I certainly don't believe that we will get 40%. It's possible but extremely unlikely. And I will be very happy with 30% account growth and the event that is -- those new accounts as we keep going over that fact the new accounts tend to be somewhat smaller although we do have several prospect, a larger prospect in the pipeline, but they tend to be basically in the introducing brokers space and they are likely to be more and more omnibus accounts. In other words when they join us they will not show up in the account bills. So, somebody could join us, with say, 100,000 accounts, but it will just show up as one account, because it is going to be one omnibus account. You are absolutely right. We are going to keep on accumulating capital and firming up our credibility in the eyes of the investing public. No. No. So, look, I very strongly believe that that fed rate hike will have to go much higher due to slow down inflation. Let's basically be still a negative 8%, right? So I think that just going up 2% or 3% and being at negative 6% or 5% is not going to be good enough. So I think that rates could go as high as 4% or 5% and we are not going to lend the money for any further down for that very, very short-term. I think that that low-double digits are closer to the target than the high-single digits. So we are continue to... We are continue to expand in customer service and in the number of geographies where we are establishing subsidiaries. So I would think that the $15 -- 15% increase is probably a good guess. So what we used to do in quite a long time ago was that our margin rates were between a 0.5 point and 1.5 points over Fed funds. We have increased the bottom of that so that we are between 75 basis points and 1.5 points -- 150 basis points over Fed fund. That's the only change we have made. Sorry? Oh! Yes. Yeah. Thank you. So, look, I mean, the way it works for us, is sad for our customers practically another three . So something like 52% of the customers do three or less trades a year. Fed that up against the remaining 48%, where the average customer with $100,000 in assets in these accounts creates 230 times a year. And from there on, for every 60% increase in funds in the account, the trading volume doubles and it's surprisingly a very straight line. You are right. Thank you. So, we didn't really have redemptions other than the Futu and Tiger broker going away, right? And there were some European introducing brokers who were extremely active in last year and they have -- their activity has drastically diminished this year. But -- so -- what is -- tell me again, what is it that you would exactly try to find out? Inflow by geography, well, it's basically due to the -- so I am looking at the annual numbers here and I -- and due to the, as I said, the going away of Futu and Tiger. Our inflow from Asia is basically unchanged for the year, while in the -- for the Americas, Americas it's up 11% and from Europe it's up 17%, so that's roughly, those are the numbers. Well, we find it very difficult to COVID hurdle. We keep thinking that one of these days the growth will just exceed the continues hunger to build new things and the growth on the backbone that we have built up to that point is going to exceed the continuing spending the new investments. But we haven't seen that happen yet. So we just keep thinking that may happen in the future, but it hasn't so far and it certainly is not likely to happen this year, maybe later on."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Interactive Brokers Group Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Nancy Stuebe, Director of Investor Relations.\nNancy Stuebe: Good afternoon, happy new year, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Thomas is on the call, and asked me to present his comments on the business. Also joining us today are Milan Galik, our CEO, and Paul Brody, our CFO. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A. As a reminder, today\u2019s call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company\u2019s belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company\u2019s control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. In 2023, we added over 470,000 net new accounts. Our client equity at year-end was up 39% to $426 billion, an increase of over $100 billion from last year. We earned over $4 billion in net revenues and over $3 billion in pretax income, both for the first time. Our pretax margin was 71% for the full year \u2013 by far, the highest in the industry: in fact, very few public companies in any industry have that kind of profit margin. If market conditions continue as they are, even with the three interest rate cuts predicted, I see no reason why we wouldn\u2019t be able to maintain pretax margin at the 70% level. We saw stronger markets in 2023, with the same focus on options and on the Magnificent Seven stock names that we have seen for a year now. We see options being actively traded both traditionally as a means to offset risk, and as standalone zero day to expiry. Regarding interest rates, we are not willing to argue with the market. If the market believes that long-term rates will be under 4%, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s our business to dispute it. However, there are several long-term trends that, in my opinion, call for higher inflation and higher rates in the long run. First is deglobalization. Over the past few decades, where goods are manufactured has been re- allocated around the globe, often far from consumers as containerization reduced shipping expenses, and manufacturing went where it\u2019s cheapest. Prices of some goods were driven down 50% to 90%. But now, as we have been predicting, geopolitical uncertainty has driven transportation costs up, with insurance for transport rising every day as vessels are attacked and routes become unsafe. To start producing closer to consumers, where labor is often more expensive, means higher costs and prices. Second is demographics. For the most part, skilled labor is produced in developed countries, like the US and Europe, and to some extent in Asia. Population growth, however, is occurring in those countries where skilled labor is not produced. Birth rates and population growth have dramatically reversed in developed countries to decreasing instead of growing, meaning that skilled labor will cost more and more over time. Third are deficits, deficits contribute to inflation, as interest payments get funded through deficit spending, which then means bigger deficits and higher interest, which gets added onto the deficit, on and on, so it is unclear to me how inflation can substantially decrease as the deficit grows. Fourth, the ever-increasing demand for spending on environmental projects will continue to become more and more expensive. Combining these factors, it is hard to see how inflation will subside over the long term, even if in the next several months it may ameliorate somewhat. These trends are inescapable, and while you may see long term rates at 4% for now, they could go back to 5%, 6%, 7% or more as costs, deficit spending and the national debt keep increasing. Turning to our business, our client accounts and client equity grew fastest in Europe and Asia as more and more people worldwide want to access international markets, invest in securities they feel offer the most upside regardless of what type of security it is or where it is traded, and hold what they perceive as \u201csafer\u201d currencies. In 2023, individuals saw the fastest account growth among our five client segments, and the second highest commission and net interest growth. Proprietary traders had the fastest client equity and commission growth. Introducing brokers had the highest net interest growth, followed by individuals and financial advisors \u2013 all well over 50%. While we saw growth in hedge fund accounts and significantly higher client equity, they showed a smaller increase in commission and interest activity than our proprietary traders or individuals. This is likely due to so many funds holding the same Magnificent Seven names, but as many of you are on the call maybe you can expand on this. We had one of our busiest years ever of programming. During 2023, we added a wide range of features and capabilities including those for financial advisors; and enhanced IBKR Mobile, Portfolio Analyst, our CRM, and Student Training Lab, plus added comprehensive new content at our Traders Academy, Quant Blog, and Traders Insight. Our new \u201cDiscover\u201d tool lets you see technical insights using actionable analysis and alerts, with a Market Buzz bubble map to identify the companies most in the news, allowing clients to go more in-depth with analytics and sentiment, and has proven quite popular. For our long-short hedge fund and proprietary trading clients, we added features like a Securities Lending dashboard, which gives an expanded universe of securities lending data like borrower and lender depth, among other items. For financial advisors, we are significantly less expensive than competitors. To give an idea of the \u201cvalue-add\u201d we offer to financial advisors, when an advisor buys a mutual fund for his or her clients at Interactive Brokers, we charge a maximum of $14.95 for the entire trade, and nothing for allocating the mutual fund among any number of clients after the trade. In contrast, competitors charge $45, per account, to allocate a trade. Our biggest issue is that FAs do not believe us when we tell them they can save thousands of dollars each time they update their customers\u2019 portfolios! For our option traders who do not absolutely need an immediate fill, we built a facility to trade at the mid-price against our marketable order-flow. Option orders in frequently-traded options have a very good chance of being filled within a few minutes. A growing percentage of our options order flow gets successfully executed through this facility. This is in addition to our similar facility for equities, which we have had for some time now and which we continue to build. As we onboard more and more institutional clients, we get more and more liquidity in our ATS, especially for institutions willing to rest orders for a brief period of time. Ultimately, we believe that the most a broker can do for its customers who trade frequently is to give them the best possible execution prices. This has always been the most important consideration as we have developed our platform over the years. In 2024, we have another active year of programming projects planned, and you will see further upgrades to our platform with more features and capabilities. We are also adding new countries where our clients can trade. I will not say more to avoid tipping off our competitors! Finally, we are well aware that we have now reached $14 billion in equity on our balance sheet. We are considering possible opportunities in the space that would help us grow the business. Our public float is small, so we are unlikely to buy back shares, and personally speaking I would hope that an opportunity presents itself, as raising the dividend is not something I think helps a company grow in the long run. There is much to look forward to. The Interactive Brokers platform is built with the purpose of bringing investors and marketplaces together to interact with each other, all over the world, optimizing the allocation of capital and resources. It is our job to educate current and beginning investors, to develop the best tools and capabilities to facilitate their investing journey. We are as busy programming as we\u2019ve ever been. This, and our much lower cost structure, is what sets us apart, and will continue to do so in the years ahead. With that, I will turn the call over to Paul Brody. Paul?\nPaul Brody: Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon, everybody and thanks for joining the call. I\u2019ll review the fourth quarter results, and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Starting with our Revenue items on page 3 of the release, we are pleased with our financial results this quarter, roughly matching the record adjusted net revenues and pretax income of the prior quarter. And for the full year 2023, we achieved record results in every major financial measure. Commissions rose versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter, reaching $348 million. For the full year, commissions were $1.4 billion, up 3% from 2022. In 2023, we saw higher trading volumes in options and futures, coming from our large base of sophisticated and active traders, investors and advisors. Net interest income of $730 million for the quarter, and a record $2.8 billion for the year, reflected a risk-on environment that led to steadily higher margin lending as well as higher yields on our margin loans and segregated cash portfolio. This was partially offset by the higher interest paid to our customers on their cash balances, as Interactive Brokers passes through to them all rate hikes above the first 50 basis points on their qualified funds, which differentiates us in an environment where many competitors pay little to nothing to their customers. Other fees and services generated $55 million for the quarter and $197 million for the year. The increase from the prior year quarter was driven by the risk-on positioning of customers, which led to a rise in risk exposure fees to $17 million, as well as higher FDIC sweeps fees, which rose to $6 million this quarter. Market data fees of $17 million and exchange liquidity payments of $8 million were the other factors in this category. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy, and principal transactions. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings. Without these excluded items, other income was $16 million for both the quarter and the full year. Turning to expenses, Execution, Clearing and Distribution costs were $100 million in the quarter, and $386 million for the year, up versus last year primarily due to higher volumes in options and futures, which carry higher fees. As a percent of commission revenues, Execution & Clearing costs were 23% in the fourth quarter for a Gross Transactional Profit margin of 77%, unchanged from last quarter. We calculate this by excluding from \"Execution & Clearing\u201d $20 million of costs, predominantly market data, without a direct commission revenue component. Compensation & Benefits expense was $136 million for the quarter, for a ratio of Compensation expense to Adjusted Net Revenues of 12%, unchanged from last year. For the year, this ratio was also 12%, down from 14% in 2022. We are always focused on expense discipline while improving our strong top line. Our headcount at year-end was 2,932. G&A expenses were $45 million, down from the year-ago quarter. For the full year, recall that 2023\u2019s number is inflated due to a previously-disclosed regulatory settlement in the second quarter. Without that, full year G&A would have been even with 2022. Our pretax margin was 72% for the quarter and 71% for the year. Automation and expense control, along with thoughtful management of our balance sheet, remain our key means of maintaining high margins, while we invest in the future of our business. Income Taxes of $77 million reflects the sum of the public company\u2019s $45 million and the operating companies\u2019 $32 million. The public company\u2019s taxes included a decrease in the deferred tax asset, which reflects an annual remeasurement of future tax benefits. Together with some other items, these had an $8 million impact on income taxes. Removing these one-time non-cash items, the public company\u2019s adjusted effective tax rate was 17.9%, within its usual range. For the year, taxes of $257 million are the sum of the public company\u2019s $142 million and the operating companies\u2019 $115 million. Moving to our balance sheet on page 5 of the Release, our total assets ended the year 12% higher at $128 billion, with growth driven by higher customer cash and margin loan balances from both new and existing customers. We maintain a balance sheet geared towards supporting our growing business and providing sufficient financial resources during volatile markets. We have no long-term debt. Our ample capital base is deployed primarily in running our current business and our liquidity positions us to support our customers during periods of high market stress. It also helps us win new business, by showing the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners. In our operating data, on pages 6 and 7, our contract volumes in options for all customers rose 21% over the prior-year quarter, well above industry growth. Futures contract volumes rose 4%, while stock share volume declined for us as it did across the industry. For the full year, options and futures contract volumes rose 12% and 1%, respectively. The decrease in stock share volume was largely attributable to lower trading in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks. The notional value of brokerage shares traded, however, was up in most markets, particularly in the US, as clients gravitated to larger, higher quality names. On page 7, you can see that total Customer DARTs were 1.9 million trades per day, up 2% from the prior year and reflecting a more risk-on period for investors. Commission per Cleared Commissionable Order of $3.19 was up slightly from last year, driven by increases in futures volume and average trade size. Options contributed higher volume but a lower average trade size, and stock trade volume and average trade size both declined. Page 8 shows our Net Interest Margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income was $730 million for the quarter, up 29%, and $2.8 billion for the year, up 68%. Our net interest income as displayed in our NIM, was $9 million higher, or $739 million, as we include income here that for GAAP purposes is classified as other fees or other income, but that we feel is more appropriately considered interest. These results reflect strength in margin loan and segregated cash interest, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. Most central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, held interest rates steady this quarter, with only Australia increasing its benchmark rate slightly. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates four times over the year, raising the average US Fed funds rate for the fourth quarter to 5.33% from 3.65% the prior year. Our segregated cash interest income rose 67% on a 4% increase in average balances, while margin loan interest rose by 50% on a 9% increase in average balances. The average duration of our portfolio remained at under 30 days. With the US dollar yield curve inverting further over the fourth quarter, we have been maximizing what we earn by capturing higher short-term yields, rather than accept the significantly lower yields of longer maturities. In this rate environment, this strategy allows us to maintain a relatively tight maturity match with the rate we pay our customers. Securities lending net interest has not been as strong as in prior quarters for two main reasons. First, overall customer demand for shorting stocks has fallen. There were fewer \u201chard to borrow\u201d names industry-wide which, with the market\u2019s low volatility, are the drivers of securities lending. Second, as we have noted on previous calls, higher average interest rates versus prior periods means more of what we earn from securities lending is classified as interest on \u201csegregated cash\u201d. To more accurately compare our securities lending revenue with the year-ago quarter, we estimate that if the interest earned on this cash collateral fell under \u201cSecurities Borrowed and Loaned\u201d, it would have been $18 million higher, or $61 million. Interest on Customer Credit Balances, the interest we pay to our customers on the cash in their accounts, rose on both higher rates in nearly all currencies and higher balances from new account growth. As we have noted many times in the past, the high interest rates we pay on customer cash \u2013 currently 4.83% on qualified US dollar balances \u2013 is a significant driver of new customers. Fully rate-sensitive balances were about $18 billion this quarter. Now, for our estimates of the impact of changes in rates. Given market expectations of rate cuts in 2024, we estimate the effect of such changes in the Fed Funds rate to be a $56 million reduction in annual net interest income for each 25-basis point decrease in the benchmark. Note that our starting point for these estimates is year-end, with the Fed Funds effective rate at 5.33%, and average balances as of December 31st. Any growth in our balance sheet and interest- earning assets would reduce this impact. About 25% of our customer cash balances is not in US dollars, so estimates of a US rate change exclude those currencies. We estimate the effect of decreases in all the relevant non-USD benchmark rates would further reduce annual net interest income by $18 to $20 million for each 25-basis point decrease in those benchmarks. In conclusion, we had a financially strong quarter to close out a record year in net revenues and pretax margin, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base and deliver on our core value proposition to customers while scaling the business. This highlights the attractiveness of our strategy \u2013 automating as much of the brokerage business as possible and expanding what we offer while minimizing what we charge. And with that, we\u2019d like to open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Yaro with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Yaro: I\u2019d like to start with your outlook for deploying your excess capital. Maybe you could just speak to how you think about the balance between organic investment and inorganic growth. And then perhaps if you could just speak to the timeline over which you might contemplate that inorganic growth and what sort of businesses you might be looking for?\nMilan Galik: So, as you know, we have significant cash reserves, significant amount of capital that we could deploy and would like to deploy. We have been looking for possible acquisition targets. They are all in our industry. They tend to be brokers who are less efficient than we are. We have closely looked at a number of them. We either find the price to be too high for acquisition or find that the acquisition would represent a very significant amount of work in terms of the integration. So, so far we have not found any target that we would actively go after. But we hope that that will change in the future.\nJames Yaro: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Maybe if we could just touch quickly on the prime brokerage and prop trading opportunity. Maybe if you could just speak to where you see\u2013 where you are in the growth ramp for prime. And what do you think the business could look like on your platform over the next few years? You have talked about adding new hedge funds, both the small and large. So maybe you could just speak about when you talk to those clients, what attracts the larger hedge funds to your platform?\nMilan Galik: Interactive Brokers has been successful in attracting smaller hedge funds. These are typically the hedge funds that the bigger primes declined to do business with because of the higher cost structure that they have. And then what we find is as the hedge funds get bigger, they start to look around and consider these larger competitors of ours. We would obviously like to reverse that trend, but it\u2019s not going to be easy. Part of the problem that we are dealing with is that the large primes are banks that have been in business for 100 years or more and they have created a very significant brand recognition. That is what we are up against. So, we hope that the significant amount of capital that we have on our balance sheet will be attractive for the manager that looks at our large competitors, they will consider us because they will walk away with the belief that their assets are safe with us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: We wanted your perspective on the potential money in motion in the active trader segment. So, your biggest active trader competitor will be integrating into a larger financial services firm in a few months. And I\u2019m wondering if you think this is an opportunity for IBKR to pick up share in the active trader segment.\nMilan Galik: Are we talking about thinkorswim and Schwab?\nCraig Siegenthaler: Yes.\nMilan Galik: So, to my knowledge, the thinkorswim platform is going to be made available to the active traders on the Schwab platform. So, I would not necessarily see this as an opportunity for the accounts to move from Schwab to Interactive Brokers, but you might have heard something different. I\u2019m not sure.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Okay. For my follow-up, can you provide us your outlook for margin loan balances? Are we at a point where you think they can start to grow?\nMilan Galik: Well, the margin loan balances are somewhat related to the interest rates, how expensive it is to put the margin positions on. They also depend on the market opportunities that are in the market. So, the higher the volatility, the greater these balances tend to be. As the number of accounts is growing, that should also increase the margin balances. So, I\u2019m optimistic that they will increase over time.\nOperator: One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Benjamin Budish with Barclays.\nBenjamin Budish: You made the comment earlier in the prepared remarks about the 70% margin for this year, and I think earlier at a public appearance, you talked about sort of high single-digit operating expense growth for the year. Can you maybe talk about what that means for the top line? How do you think about sort of the interplay between lower rates potentially impacting net interest income, maybe this is offset by higher commissions. We\u2019ve seen cash balances come up a little bit. How do you think about those two\u2013 sort of the interplay between those two and how that could evolve over the year and perhaps how you think about that a little bit longer term? I know in the past, you\u2019ve sort of commented well, the margin could maybe in the low 60s to high 60s. It sounds like there\u2019s a little bit more confidence on that 70% mark. So just curious of your thoughts there.\nThomas Peterffy: So, I think it\u2019s going to be a race -- a dead heat -- between lower interest rates, reducing our earnings and higher\u2013 more activity increasing our earnings. So that\u2019s how I see it.\nBenjamin Budish: Got it. And maybe any\u2013 last year, you sort of gave us an early look on the account\u2013 expected account growth into \u201823. I understand your position on the introducing brokers at this point, but any thoughts on what to expect this year or sort of 20% the right way to think about it? Any potentially large partners onboarding that might come on at any point?\nMilan Galik: Well, I think the best piece of guidance we can give you is that you can look at how we have been growing over time and you can sort of jump to your own conclusions as to how that is going to look. The mix of the business, the various segments of the business that we have -- individual clients, introducing brokers, hedge funds, prop trading firms, financial advisers -- It\u2019s not obvious to me how that makes you change over time. So, I would expect roughly the same growth numbers for the next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: Thomas, you just talked about this sort of briefly, but I\u2019m curious if you drill down into it a little bit in more detail. So\u2014 and how we should be thinking about the offsets? And obviously, there\u2019s a $56 million impact for each 25-basis point rate cut. But how do you think about lower rates and how that translates into volumes and commissions and higher cash balances and margin loans? Like how do you anticipate that interplay to actually develop?\nThomas Peterffy: So, I expect rates to be cut by 75 basis points in the course of the year. As you heard, our interest income would come down by $300 million\u2014 actually $304 million, if you extrapolate what Paul said putting US dollar deposits and foreign deposits together. So, if we come down by three- quarters that will be $220 million\u2014about $230 million. And I think that\u2014 I mean, look\u2014 I believe that our earnings increased due to the continuing increasing activity and increasing number of accounts and new accounts being onboarded will outstrip that. But I can\u2019t promise you that, it\u2019s just what I think. So, I do believe that on balance, our earnings in 2024 will be higher than they were in 2023.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. And then when we think about the margin balances, the margin balances continue to show good growth. How much of the growth in margin balances coming from new accounts, right? And therefore, that doesn\u2019t really have to do with any change in risk appetite in the existing customer base versus new accounts that are coming on and growing the margin organically?\nThomas Peterffy: We slice and dice our accounts in many ways, but we don\u2019t look at new accounts versus old accounts, sorry.\nBrennan Hawken: Fair enough. Maybe let me try and say it another way. The increase in the margin balances that we\u2019ve been seeing here recently, do you believe that this growth is sustainable?\nThomas Peterffy: Of course. Look, we are the least expensive provider of margin loans to\u2014especially to retail customers, but also to institutional traders.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDaniel Fannon: My question is on sec lending and the outlook there, understanding that hard to borrowers have declined. But are you seeing replacement through other\u2014 options, futures, that behavior is changing? Or as you think about markets normalizing, engagement picking up, but we should see a natural pickup in the demand for sec lending?\nPaul Brody: So, there\u2019s two things at work there, really. There\u2019s the baseline of what are the general shorts in the marketplace, which have been down and those are not under our control, but when things get more volatile, maybe more stocks get more interesting, look over valued and the shorts go up. And then what really drives the P&L there is that particular stocks get very hot for a while. The demand outstrips the supply for borrowing those stocks because the shorts go up. And the rates go very high on those, and we make much more money lending them as do our customers when they are signed up for our fully paid lending program, and they get generally about half of what we earn by lending to the Street. So, it\u2019s very opportunity-driven. The best we can do is what we\u2019ve been doing for years. We\u2019ve developed really expert systems at managing that inventory and trying to maximize the profitability when the opportunities come up.\nMilan Galik: Maybe as the IPO space becomes more active, there are going to be some overpriced stocks trading out there with relatively small float and that could act as an increase of this activity.\nDaniel Fannon: Understood. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a follow-up on the inorganic discussion. Could we maybe put some financial metrics around what you guys would be looking to get in terms of returns. Obviously, your pretax margins are, as you mentioned, industry-high. So the ability to make\u2014to replicate that through M&A is probably very difficult. But\u2014 just is there a return threshold, accretion, other kind of financial measures that we could think about as the bogeys for an inorganic transaction.\nMilan Galik: Well, so there are various factors that we take into consideration. Number one would be how big the acquisition is, how much of our capital would we have to spend. Obviously, we would not want to spend our energy on something too small. And at the same time, we would be too worried about getting into something very large. We would look at what is the overlap between the financial services company we are looking at acquiring with what we are currently offering to our clients. How much synergies can we recognize. The amount of work that we would have to do to integrate the acquired company systems with ours. So, all these things are closely looked at apart from the pricing structure that the to-be acquired company has. In other words, how much would we have to adjust, the commissions and interest they charge. Would the revenues significantly change if the company becomes associated with Interactive Brokers? So, there is a whole bunch of different factors that we that we look at, and we have done that a number of times. We have gotten close to two purchases, in both of the cases, we were not able to agree on the price with the target.\nOperator: One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW.\nKyle Voigt: First question is on expenses. If we exclude the $45 million, I think, one-time expense that was realized in the second quarter of 2023, I\u2019m calculating that your fixed expense growth was roughly 12% for full year 2023. Is that the best run rate expense growth rate that we should be thinking about for 2024 as well? And if we get into an environment where the Fed is significantly cutting interest rates, would that expense growth trajectory change at all in order to maintain that 70% pretax margin that you mentioned in your prepared remarks?\nMilan Galik: So, 70% profit margin would get somewhat affected by the decrease in interest rates. You have already heard a little earlier, Paul Brody talking about the impact of the quarter percent cut on our net interest income. However, as Thomas alluded to, we hope that the commission income would offset these decreases in net interest income. So probably the revenue wouldn\u2019t change. What we have to pay very close attention to is our expenses. We have a very significant headcount\u2014there is 2,900 employees working for the company. We have recently, over the past several years, we have had to increase the compensation every year because of the significant inflation, that inflation may stay with us, which would mean that we could expect the compensation expense to increase next year as well. And this is something that we really need to pay attention to. We would like to keep the headcount the same, if possible. But obviously, that could change. If we ever see that we are falling behind in customer service, we would have to adjust. But with the advances in, for example, AI, we hope that we can keep this number steady.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. Then just a follow-up, just going back to the M&A discussion. I think now you have over $10 billion of excess regulatory capital. But historically, you wanted to keep some of that as an additional cushion above the regulatory minimums to support the prime brokerage business. I guess when we\u2019re thinking about potential acquisition sizes that you are evaluating, I guess, how much of that $10 billion excess regulatory capital could theoretically be deployed for M&A? And anything you could share with respect to general size of assets that you\u2019re looking at relative to this excess capital level.\nMilan Galik: Well, I would not necessarily look at $10 billion excess as the guidance towards the size of acquisitions we would be willing to make. It would be most likely the case that the acquired company would be paid for as a mix of stock and cash so we would not use up all the cash. We like to have a strong balance sheet. We have seen what happened to Robinhood a few years ago. We have seen what happened to Knight Trading -- I don\u2019t know whether you remember them -- more than a decade ago. We like the safety that comes with a strong balance sheet. So, we would not want to spend anywhere near to the entire excess capital that we have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Citi, may proceed.\nChris Allen: Just have a couple of follow-ups. Just on the M&A discussion, the targets you\u2019re looking at \u2014 any preference from a regional perspective or a product or a capability perspective that you\u2019re looking at? Or is it more just about efficiencies?\nMilan Galik: It\u2019s about efficiencies. There is no preference. We are a global company, so it really doesn\u2019t matter where.\nChris Allen: And then obviously, headcount has increased at healthy levels, which has driven some of the compensation increases. What\u2019s the outlook for hiring going forward? Do you need to continue to hire at a healthy pace to expand internationally in other areas? And what\u2019s the pressure in terms of compensation from a competitive dynamic?\nMilan Galik: So we are of the view that we are sufficiently staffed on the technology staff. As far as the customer service is concerned, we are paying very close attention to our metrics\u2014 the abandoned calls, calls in queue, wait times. They have looked sufficiently healthy that we are running at the levels that we are comfortable with. If, all of a sudden, we receive either by acquisitions or by organic growth, significantly higher number of accounts, we may have to adjust but we are trying to counteract it as much as possible by automating the customer service as much as possible. And I could probably say similar things about the surveillance employees and operators that we have. There are hundreds of them that we currently employ. We constantly work on making the tools that they use more efficient, so that even if the market activity picks up and number of accounts increases, we would like to be able to operate with the same level of staffing as we currently do.\nOperator: One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler.\nPatrick Moley: I was just hoping to get your thoughts on the recent spot Bitcoin ETF approval. What impact, if any, it\u2019s had on your business? Maybe any sort of behavioral shifts you\u2019re seeing among your customer base and how you think you\u2019re positioned, I guess, in overall crypto digital asset space going forward?\nMilan Galik: So, we were one of the firms and maybe the only broker that was making these 11 ETFs available on their platform on Day One. Our customers immediately started trading these ETFs. Obviously, this is going to make the cryptocurrency investing more mainstream, because the investors that were reluctant to jump into this space before, having these ETFs in existence made that easier for them. So I think they are going to\u2014 the cryptocurrencies are going to become a portion of a great number of investors\u2019 portfolios out there. As to what it\u2019s going to mean to our investors, our customers, it\u2019s hard to tell. As you know, our clientele tends to be a little bit more active, more sophisticated. I think some of them will recognize the opportunity to trade the cryptocurrency itself as well as the ETF on our platform. There may be some arbitrage opportunities that develop. I think it\u2019s too early to tell how it will play out.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Nancy Stuebe for any closing remarks.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will talk to you next quarter end.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "So, as you know, we have significant cash reserves, significant amount of capital that we could deploy and would like to deploy. We have been looking for possible acquisition targets. They are all in our industry. They tend to be brokers who are less efficient than we are. We have closely looked at a number of them. We either find the price to be too high for acquisition or find that the acquisition would represent a very significant amount of work in terms of the integration. So, so far we have not found any target that we would actively go after. But we hope that that will change in the future. Interactive Brokers has been successful in attracting smaller hedge funds. These are typically the hedge funds that the bigger primes declined to do business with because of the higher cost structure that they have. And then what we find is as the hedge funds get bigger, they start to look around and consider these larger competitors of ours. We would obviously like to reverse that trend, but it's not going to be easy. Part of the problem that we are dealing with is that the large primes are banks that have been in business for 100 years or more and they have created a very significant brand recognition. That is what we are up against. So, we hope that the significant amount of capital that we have on our balance sheet will be attractive for the manager that looks at our large competitors, they will consider us because they will walk away with the belief that their assets are safe with us. Are we talking about thinkorswim and Schwab? So, to my knowledge, the thinkorswim platform is going to be made available to the active traders on the Schwab platform. So, I would not necessarily see this as an opportunity for the accounts to move from Schwab to Interactive Brokers, but you might have heard something different. I'm not sure. Well, the margin loan balances are somewhat related to the interest rates, how expensive it is to put the margin positions on. They also depend on the market opportunities that are in the market. So, the higher the volatility, the greater these balances tend to be. As the number of accounts is growing, that should also increase the margin balances. So, I'm optimistic that they will increase over time. Well, I think the best piece of guidance we can give you is that you can look at how we have been growing over time and you can sort of jump to your own conclusions as to how that is going to look.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Nancy Stuebe",
            "content": "Good afternoon, happy new year, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. Thomas is on the call, and asked me to present his comments on the business. Also joining us today are Milan Galik, our CEO, and Paul Brody, our CFO. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. In 2023, we added over 470,000 net new accounts. Our client equity at year-end was up 39% to $426 billion, an increase of over $100 billion from last year. We earned over $4 billion in net revenues and over $3 billion in pretax income, both for the first time. Our pretax margin was 71% for the full year \u2013 by far, the highest in the industry: in fact, very few public companies in any industry have that kind of profit margin. If market conditions continue as they are, even with the three interest rate cuts predicted, I see no reason why we wouldn't be able to maintain pretax margin at the 70% level. We saw stronger markets in 2023, with the same focus on options and on the Magnificent Seven stock names that we have seen for a year now. We see options being actively traded both traditionally as a means to offset risk, and as standalone zero day to expiry. Regarding interest rates, we are not willing to argue with the market. If the market believes that long-term rates will be under 4%, we don't think it's our business to dispute it. However, there are several long-term trends that, in my opinion, call for higher inflation and higher rates in the long run. First is deglobalization. Over the past few decades, where goods are manufactured has been re- allocated around the globe, often far from consumers as containerization reduced shipping expenses, and manufacturing went where it's cheapest. Prices of some goods were driven down 50% to 90%. But now, as we have been predicting, geopolitical uncertainty has driven transportation costs up, with insurance for transport rising every day as vessels are attacked and routes become unsafe. To start producing closer to consumers, where labor is often more expensive, means higher costs and prices. Second is demographics. For the most part, skilled labor is produced in developed countries, like the US and Europe, and to some extent in Asia. Population growth, however, is occurring in those countries where skilled labor is not produced. Birth rates and population growth have dramatically reversed in developed countries to decreasing instead of growing, meaning that skilled labor will cost more and more over time. Third are deficits, deficits contribute to inflation, as interest payments get funded through deficit spending, which then means bigger deficits and higher interest, which gets added onto the deficit, on and on, so it is unclear to me how inflation can substantially decrease as the deficit grows. Fourth, the ever-increasing demand for spending on environmental projects will continue to become more and more expensive. Combining these factors, it is hard to see how inflation will subside over the long term, even if in the next several months it may ameliorate somewhat. These trends are inescapable, and while you may see long term rates at 4% for now, they could go back to 5%, 6%, 7% or more as costs, deficit spending and the national debt keep increasing. Turning to our business, our client accounts and client equity grew fastest in Europe and Asia as more and more people worldwide want to access international markets, invest in securities they feel offer the most upside regardless of what type of security it is or where it is traded, and hold what they perceive as \u201csafer\u201d currencies. In 2023, individuals saw the fastest account growth among our five client segments, and the second highest commission and net interest growth. Proprietary traders had the fastest client equity and commission growth. Introducing brokers had the highest net interest growth, followed by individuals and financial advisors \u2013 all well over 50%. While we saw growth in hedge fund accounts and significantly higher client equity, they showed a smaller increase in commission and interest activity than our proprietary traders or individuals. This is likely due to so many funds holding the same Magnificent Seven names, but as many of you are on the call maybe you can expand on this. We had one of our busiest years ever of programming. During 2023, we added a wide range of features and capabilities including those for financial advisors; and enhanced IBKR Mobile, Portfolio Analyst, our CRM, and Student Training Lab, plus added comprehensive new content at our Traders Academy, Quant Blog, and Traders Insight. Our new \u201cDiscover\u201d tool lets you see technical insights using actionable analysis and alerts, with a Market Buzz bubble map to identify the companies most in the news, allowing clients to go more in-depth with analytics and sentiment, and has proven quite popular. For our long-short hedge fund and proprietary trading clients, we added features like a Securities Lending dashboard, which gives an expanded universe of securities lending data like borrower and lender depth, among other items. For financial advisors, we are significantly less expensive than competitors. To give an idea of the \u201cvalue-add\u201d we offer to financial advisors, when an advisor buys a mutual fund for his or her clients at Interactive Brokers, we charge a maximum of $14.95 for the entire trade, and nothing for allocating the mutual fund among any number of clients after the trade. In contrast, competitors charge $45, per account, to allocate a trade. Our biggest issue is that FAs do not believe us when we tell them they can save thousands of dollars each time they update their customers' portfolios! For our option traders who do not absolutely need an immediate fill, we built a facility to trade at the mid-price against our marketable order-flow. Option orders in frequently-traded options have a very good chance of being filled within a few minutes. A growing percentage of our options order flow gets successfully executed through this facility. This is in addition to our similar facility for equities, which we have had for some time now and which we continue to build. As we onboard more and more institutional clients, we get more and more liquidity in our ATS, especially for institutions willing to rest orders for a brief period of time. Ultimately, we believe that the most a broker can do for its customers who trade frequently is to give them the best possible execution prices. This has always been the most important consideration as we have developed our platform over the years. In 2024, we have another active year of programming projects planned, and you will see further upgrades to our platform with more features and capabilities. We are also adding new countries where our clients can trade. I will not say more to avoid tipping off our competitors! Finally, we are well aware that we have now reached $14 billion in equity on our balance sheet. We are considering possible opportunities in the space that would help us grow the business. Our public float is small, so we are unlikely to buy back shares, and personally speaking I would hope that an opportunity presents itself, as raising the dividend is not something I think helps a company grow in the long run. There is much to look forward to. The Interactive Brokers platform is built with the purpose of bringing investors and marketplaces together to interact with each other, all over the world, optimizing the allocation of capital and resources. It is our job to educate current and beginning investors, to develop the best tools and capabilities to facilitate their investing journey. We are as busy programming as we've ever been. This, and our much lower cost structure, is what sets us apart, and will continue to do so in the years ahead. With that, I will turn the call over to Paul Brody. Paul? Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will talk to you next quarter end."

            "name": "Paul Brody",
            "content": "Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon, everybody and thanks for joining the call. I'll review the fourth quarter results, and then we'll open it up for questions. Starting with our Revenue items on page 3 of the release, we are pleased with our financial results this quarter, roughly matching the record adjusted net revenues and pretax income of the prior quarter. And for the full year 2023, we achieved record results in every major financial measure. Commissions rose versus last year's fourth quarter, reaching $348 million. For the full year, commissions were $1.4 billion, up 3% from 2022. In 2023, we saw higher trading volumes in options and futures, coming from our large base of sophisticated and active traders, investors and advisors. Net interest income of $730 million for the quarter, and a record $2.8 billion for the year, reflected a risk-on environment that led to steadily higher margin lending as well as higher yields on our margin loans and segregated cash portfolio. This was partially offset by the higher interest paid to our customers on their cash balances, as Interactive Brokers passes through to them all rate hikes above the first 50 basis points on their qualified funds, which differentiates us in an environment where many competitors pay little to nothing to their customers. Other fees and services generated $55 million for the quarter and $197 million for the year. The increase from the prior year quarter was driven by the risk-on positioning of customers, which led to a rise in risk exposure fees to $17 million, as well as higher FDIC sweeps fees, which rose to $6 million this quarter. Market data fees of $17 million and exchange liquidity payments of $8 million were the other factors in this category. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy, and principal transactions. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings. Without these excluded items, other income was $16 million for both the quarter and the full year. Turning to expenses, Execution, Clearing and Distribution costs were $100 million in the quarter, and $386 million for the year, up versus last year primarily due to higher volumes in options and futures, which carry higher fees. As a percent of commission revenues, Execution & Clearing costs were 23% in the fourth quarter for a Gross Transactional Profit margin of 77%, unchanged from last quarter. We calculate this by excluding from \"Execution & Clearing\u201d $20 million of costs, predominantly market data, without a direct commission revenue component. Compensation & Benefits expense was $136 million for the quarter, for a ratio of Compensation expense to Adjusted Net Revenues of 12%, unchanged from last year. For the year, this ratio was also 12%, down from 14% in 2022. We are always focused on expense discipline while improving our strong top line. Our headcount at year-end was 2,932. G&A expenses were $45 million, down from the year-ago quarter. For the full year, recall that 2023's number is inflated due to a previously-disclosed regulatory settlement in the second quarter. Without that, full year G&A would have been even with 2022. Our pretax margin was 72% for the quarter and 71% for the year. Automation and expense control, along with thoughtful management of our balance sheet, remain our key means of maintaining high margins, while we invest in the future of our business. Income Taxes of $77 million reflects the sum of the public company's $45 million and the operating companies' $32 million. The public company's taxes included a decrease in the deferred tax asset, which reflects an annual remeasurement of future tax benefits. Together with some other items, these had an $8 million impact on income taxes. Removing these one-time non-cash items, the public company's adjusted effective tax rate was 17.9%, within its usual range. For the year, taxes of $257 million are the sum of the public company's $142 million and the operating companies' $115 million. Moving to our balance sheet on page 5 of the Release, our total assets ended the year 12% higher at $128 billion, with growth driven by higher customer cash and margin loan balances from both new and existing customers. We maintain a balance sheet geared towards supporting our growing business and providing sufficient financial resources during volatile markets. We have no long-term debt. Our ample capital base is deployed primarily in running our current business and our liquidity positions us to support our customers during periods of high market stress. It also helps us win new business, by showing the strength and depth of our balance sheet to current and prospective clients and partners. In our operating data, on pages 6 and 7, our contract volumes in options for all customers rose 21% over the prior-year quarter, well above industry growth. Futures contract volumes rose 4%, while stock share volume declined for us as it did across the industry. For the full year, options and futures contract volumes rose 12% and 1%, respectively. The decrease in stock share volume was largely attributable to lower trading in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks. The notional value of brokerage shares traded, however, was up in most markets, particularly in the US, as clients gravitated to larger, higher quality names. On page 7, you can see that total Customer DARTs were 1.9 million trades per day, up 2% from the prior year and reflecting a more risk-on period for investors. Commission per Cleared Commissionable Order of $3.19 was up slightly from last year, driven by increases in futures volume and average trade size. Options contributed higher volume but a lower average trade size, and stock trade volume and average trade size both declined. Page 8 shows our Net Interest Margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income was $730 million for the quarter, up 29%, and $2.8 billion for the year, up 68%. Our net interest income as displayed in our NIM, was $9 million higher, or $739 million, as we include income here that for GAAP purposes is classified as other fees or other income, but that we feel is more appropriately considered interest. These results reflect strength in margin loan and segregated cash interest, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. Most central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, held interest rates steady this quarter, with only Australia increasing its benchmark rate slightly. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates four times over the year, raising the average US Fed funds rate for the fourth quarter to 5.33% from 3.65% the prior year. Our segregated cash interest income rose 67% on a 4% increase in average balances, while margin loan interest rose by 50% on a 9% increase in average balances. The average duration of our portfolio remained at under 30 days. With the US dollar yield curve inverting further over the fourth quarter, we have been maximizing what we earn by capturing higher short-term yields, rather than accept the significantly lower yields of longer maturities. In this rate environment, this strategy allows us to maintain a relatively tight maturity match with the rate we pay our customers. Securities lending net interest has not been as strong as in prior quarters for two main reasons. First, overall customer demand for shorting stocks has fallen. There were fewer \u201chard to borrow\u201d names industry-wide which, with the market's low volatility, are the drivers of securities lending. Second, as we have noted on previous calls, higher average interest rates versus prior periods means more of what we earn from securities lending is classified as interest on \u201csegregated cash\u201d. To more accurately compare our securities lending revenue with the year-ago quarter, we estimate that if the interest earned on this cash collateral fell under \u201cSecurities Borrowed and Loaned\u201d, it would have been $18 million higher, or $61 million. Interest on Customer Credit Balances, the interest we pay to our customers on the cash in their accounts, rose on both higher rates in nearly all currencies and higher balances from new account growth. As we have noted many times in the past, the high interest rates we pay on customer cash \u2013 currently 4.83% on qualified US dollar balances \u2013 is a significant driver of new customers. Fully rate-sensitive balances were about $18 billion this quarter. Now, for our estimates of the impact of changes in rates. Given market expectations of rate cuts in 2024, we estimate the effect of such changes in the Fed Funds rate to be a $56 million reduction in annual net interest income for each 25-basis point decrease in the benchmark. Note that our starting point for these estimates is year-end, with the Fed Funds effective rate at 5.33%, and average balances as of December 31st. Any growth in our balance sheet and interest- earning assets would reduce this impact. About 25% of our customer cash balances is not in US dollars, so estimates of a US rate change exclude those currencies. We estimate the effect of decreases in all the relevant non-USD benchmark rates would further reduce annual net interest income by $18 to $20 million for each 25-basis point decrease in those benchmarks. In conclusion, we had a financially strong quarter to close out a record year in net revenues and pretax margin, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base and deliver on our core value proposition to customers while scaling the business. This highlights the attractiveness of our strategy \u2013 automating as much of the brokerage business as possible and expanding what we offer while minimizing what we charge. And with that, we'd like to open it up for questions. So, there's two things at work there, really. There's the baseline of what are the general shorts in the marketplace, which have been down and those are not under our control, but when things get more volatile, maybe more stocks get more interesting, look over valued and the shorts go up. And then what really drives the P&L there is that particular stocks get very hot for a while. The demand outstrips the supply for borrowing those stocks because the shorts go up. And the rates go very high on those, and we make much more money lending them as do our customers when they are signed up for our fully paid lending program, and they get generally about half of what we earn by lending to the Street. So, it's very opportunity-driven. The best we can do is what we've been doing for years. We've developed really expert systems at managing that inventory and trying to maximize the profitability when the opportunities come up."

            "content": "So, I think it's going to be a race -- a dead heat -- between lower interest rates, reducing our earnings and higher\u2013 more activity increasing our earnings. So that's how I see it. So, I expect rates to be cut by 75 basis points in the course of the year. As you heard, our interest income would come down by $300 million\u2014 actually $304 million, if you extrapolate what Paul said putting US dollar deposits and foreign deposits together. So, if we come down by three- quarters that will be $220 million\u2014about $230 million. And I think that\u2014 I mean, look\u2014 I believe that our earnings increased due to the continuing increasing activity and increasing number of accounts and new accounts being onboarded will outstrip that. But I can't promise you that, it's just what I think. So, I do believe that on balance, our earnings in 2024 will be higher than they were in 2023. We slice and dice our accounts in many ways, but we don't look at new accounts versus old accounts, sorry. Of course. Look, we are the least expensive provider of margin loans to\u2014especially to retail customers, but also to institutional traders."

        "content": "(Transcript provided to Seeking Alpha by the company.):\nOperator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Interactive Brokers Group Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker for today, Nancy Stuebe. Please go ahead.\nNancy Stuebe: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. Also joining us today are Milan Galik, our CEO, and Paul Brody, our CFO. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. Our robust operating metrics once again translated into strong financial results this quarter. Our account growth remained strong at 21%, while our client equity was up 29%. Net interest income reached a record, as did our total adjusted net revenues, which were over $1 billion for the third consecutive quarter. On the other hand, markets were down in nearly every country in the quarter, and trading volumes dropped. Low market volatility, customers moving to higher-priced stocks of companies with greater capitalization and overwhelming competitive strength, and a geopolitical environment that is increasingly uncertain, all led to lower DARTs. This meant that while we were able to increase our commission revenue slightly, reaching its fourth highest level in our history, it is still the case that investors are holding onto the same seven equities and not trading others actively. However, options volumes continue to be strong and option commissions were up the most this quarter, then came futures, while stock commission revenue dropped. As I\u2019ve said previously, I do not expect this situation to reverse. There are several competing cross-currents in the markets. If you are a long-term investor, and looking 10 years out, what you want most is stability, and not to lose a lot of money. You want to put your assets in a politically, currency- and inflation-wise stable place. While historically that has been the US, the US will look less stable politically as the election approaches, and inflation will look worse because of wage increases and union issues as well as the increasing cost of carrying US government debt. As apparent US political stability weakens, people are less likely to invest in equities. On the other hand, there is the tax liability for US taxpayers on substantially appreciated stock prices, should that gain be realized. This background explains what we have been seeing lately in the markets. Our customers\u2019 top stock holdings, the Magnificent Seven, hasn\u2019t changed much but corresponding options activity has increased. In addition, we are seeing more and more investors getting into US treasuries. Generally, activity on our government and corporate bond platform has picked up appreciably. We do not see inflation coming down substantially, and still see interest rates staying at elevated levels for a long time, which will in turn increase spending to pay the interest on this debt, adding to inflationary pressures. It remains the case that investors globally are looking to the markets to stay ahead of inflation and uncertainty. More people want to invest in securities markets, hold their choice of currency in their accounts, and gain exposure to different countries, particularly the US, as a way to build wealth and security. We continue to advertise, and closely watch which outlets work the best for us. We have built an automated advertising system, where we measure the yield and use an algorithm to adjust spending on each channel where we advertise. Telling everyone about our 4.83% return on immediately available qualified cash may have prevented withdrawals but it barely helped to increase customer cash which grew only by a little more than 2% from the prior year. In terms of our client segments, our strongest ones for account growth have been individuals and proprietary traders, which have also shown the strongest growth in 12-month commission revenue, while financial advisors, individuals and introducing brokers have seen the strongest growth in net interest income. Geographically, Europe has seen the fastest account growth, followed by Asia, then the Americas. I would like to talk about our introducing broker segment. I spoke of two large accounts coming. I regret that now, because the timing of these accounts is out of our control and with the larger of the two, it is difficult to put an exact time on it. But we have so much else going on, that I feel it is a disservice to focus only on \u201cWhen? When? When?\u201d for this 1 client, when we have so many other promising items lined up. First, the smaller of the two i-brokers successfully began onboarding their approximately 52,000 accounts; so far more than half of them are with us, and we expect the bulk of the rest by the end of the year. Next, a couple of other introducing brokers are joining us. All this is to say \u2013 when that \u201cother\u201d i-broker starts to onboard, I will let you know. Until then, I cannot put a date on it \u2013 I have been wrong on the date for a while now, so it is unclear to me why you would want me to keep giving one! But unfortunately, it is not only the date I have been wrong on. I have also misestimated the size of these operations. They now, both appear to be smaller than I originally expected and accordingly, I need to reduce my estimate of long term account growth from 30% to the low 20% area. On the hedge fund side, the most recent Preqin statistics show us moving into the number 5 position in terms of number of hedge funds for which we serve as prime broker. We were once again the fastest-growing of the top prime brokers this year. We plan to be #4 next year, behind only Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan. Our developers have been extremely busy with new products and tools, and have a full plate for the remainder of the year. This quarter, we: Introduced fractional shares trading for Canadian stocks and ETFs; Launched a Securities Lending dashboard for our more sophisticated clients to be able to assess short selling activity for specific securities and inform their decision-making; Introduced the next-generation IBKR Desktop trading platform; Launched the \u201cDiscover\u201d tool, to help clients find opportunities based on their own customized settings and trading preferences; Started our \u201cCents of Security\u201d podcast, designed to help improve financial literacy for newer investors; and Introduced long-term investment accounts in Hungary. We remain very optimistic about what our business model \u2013 international market access, a strong and secure balance sheet, and multiple features and tools, all at low prices with high interest paid on cash balances \u2013 offers to clients and potential clients around the world. In an increasingly uncertain world, the greater degrees of freedom our clients have to manage their portfolios as they wish, the better their ability to educate themselves as events change and economies increasingly fluctuate and diverge, the better off they will be. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul?\nPaul Brody: Welcome, everyone, to the call. As usual, starting with our Revenue items on page 3 of the release, we followed on our strong first and second quarter performances with net revenues reaching over $1.1 billion. With ongoing customer account and balance sheet growth, we continue to build a strong base for revenue growth in the future. Commissions were $333 million, up 4% from the year-ago quarter despite industry-wide declines in equities volume. Our options volumes, in particular, came in at a quarterly high, doubling the pace of industry volume growth. Stock share volumes declined from last year\u2019s quarter, once again driven by a drop in trading of lower-priced stocks, but also reflective of lower industry volumes. Net interest income was a quarterly record $733 million, reflecting higher interest on margin loans and segregated cash. These gains were partially offset by the higher interest we paid on customer credit balances, as our longstanding policy is to pass through rate hikes above 50 basis points to our customers on their qualified funds. Other fees and services generated $52 million, with the biggest contributors being market data fee revenue of $17 million, risk exposure fee revenue of $13 million, and options exchange liquidity payments of $8 million. The $8 million overall increase in risk exposure fees from the prior year quarter was driven by more risk-on positioning of customers. Other income was $27 million and includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings, and without these excluded items, Other income was $20 million for the quarter. Turning to expenses, Execution, Clearing & Distribution costs rose 14% versus last year, led by higher volumes in options, which carry higher fees than equities. We measure the profitability of our commissions by looking at Gross Transactional Profit, which is Commission revenue less Execution & Clearing costs. This measure excludes market data expense, which is a pass-through. In the third quarter, Execution & Clearing costs were 23% of commission revenue, for a Gross Transactional Profit margin of 77%. Compensation & Benefits expense rose 14% over the prior year quarter, on a combination of a 5% increase in average headcount and also on inflation. Compensation & Benefits expense was 11% of our adjusted Net Revenues, versus 13% last year, and below its historical level. Our headcount at quarter-end was 2,927. G&A expenses returned to a more typical level this quarter after we recorded a reserve in the second quarter for regulatory matters, which have since been settled. Versus the prior year-quarter, increases were related to advertising and legal expenses, partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees. Our adjusted pretax margin was 73%, up from 68% in the year-ago quarter. Income tax expense of $68 million reflects the sum of the public company\u2019s $36 million and the operating companies\u2019 $32 million. Moving to our balance sheet on page 5 of our release, our total assets were $121 billion at the end of the quarter, with growth over last year driven primarily by increases in our margin lending and securities lending businesses. We maintain a balance sheet aimed at supporting our growing businesses and providing ample financial resources during volatile markets, with maximum flexibility and short-term liquidity. We have no long-term debt and the duration of our U.S. investment portfolio at September 30th was 26 days. In our operating data, on pages 6 and 7, our contract volumes for all customers were strong, with options reaching their highest quarterly level, up 18% from a year ago. Futures contract volumes were down slightly, in line with industry volumes. And in stocks, the drop off of 22% was largely attributable to investors moving to higher quality stocks, as trading in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks declined the most. On page 7, you can see that our account growth remains robust, with over 140,000 net account adds in the quarter and total accounts at 2.4 million, up 21% over the prior year. Total Customer DARTs were 1.9 million trades per day, down slightly from the prior-year quarter. Our Cleared IBKR Pro Customers paid an average of $3.11 Commission per Cleared Commissionable Order, up 5% from last year as our clients\u2019 volume mix included higher per order contributions from options and futures. Page 8 presents our Net Interest Margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income rose 55% to $733 million from the year-ago quarter, reflecting stronger earnings on segregated cash and margin loans, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. With one more 25 basis point hike in the latest quarter, the average Federal funds rate was over 300 basis points higher this year than last. Many other central banks also raised rates this quarter. This group includes the UK, Canada, Hong Kong and the Eurozone. Net interest earned on segregated cash was $728 million, up $500 million from last year, primarily from global rate hikes. Maintaining a short duration on our invested funds continued to allow us to closely match asset and liability maturities and pick up benchmark rate increases quickly. As I said, at September 30th, our US portfolio duration was 26 days, so the investments have rolled over into new, higher rates with a fairly short lag time. A 5% increase over the year ago quarter in average segregated cash and securities balances also helped drive interest income higher. Margin loan interest rose to $623 million, nearly doubling the prior year quarter, despite average margin loan balances rising only slightly. Higher rates, in the US and internationally, have driven higher margin interest income. Securities lending net interest was $66 million, down from the year-ago quarter due both to lighter overall demand for so-called \u201chard-to-borrow\u201d stocks, and to a rate dynamic we have noted previously: namely, as benchmark rates rise, a greater portion of the revenue generated by lending securities, for which we receive cash collateral that we invest as segregated funds, is categorized as interest on Segregated Cash. We estimate this impact to be about $28 million for the quarter vs last year. In other words, without this shift in reporting line items, net interest from securities lending would have been $94 million, versus $114 million in the year-ago quarter. Interest on Customer Credit Balances, or the interest we pay our customers, grew as higher rates in many currencies led to our paying interest on qualifying balances as we pass through rate increases. We paid $832 million to our customers on their balances in the third quarter. Fully rate sensitive balances were up about 5% from the second quarter, at $21 billion. We consider our policy offering clients a full pass-through of all rate hikes after the first 50 basis points on their qualified cash a significant component in our success, and one that continues to set us apart. We believe this leads to clients choosing to keep their cash with us, especially active clients who do not want to use sweep programs that prevent them from immediately accessing their cash to invest. Now, for our estimates of the impact of increases in rates\u2014increases and decreases. Given market expectations of near-term rate hikes and further out rate reductions, we estimate the effects of both increases and decreases in the Fed Funds rate on our net interest income. We estimate increases in the Fed Funds rate to produce additional annual net interest income of approximately $56 million for each 25 basis point increase in the benchmark. Symmetrically, decreases in the Fed Funds rate should reduce annual net interest income by approximately $56 million for each 25 basis point decrease in the benchmark. Note that our starting point for these estimates is September 30th, with the Fed Funds effective rate at 5.33%, and based on balances at that date. About 25% of our customer cash balances is not in US dollars, so estimates of US rate change effects exclude those currencies. We estimate increases in all the relevant non-USD benchmark rates to produce additional annual net interest income of approximately $20 million for each 25 basis point increase in the benchmarks. In conclusion, the company performed well in the third quarter in a complex and uncertain environment, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base and deliver our core services to customers, at low costs and competitive interest rates, as we manage the business effectively with strong controls over risk and operating expenses. And with that, we will turn it over to our moderator and happy to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will be coming from Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: With equity now over $13 billion, we wanted to get your updated thoughts on the potential usage for deployments, either returning capital to shareholders via a dividend increase or special dividend or even through M&A. And I think you just talked up the prospects of M&A at a competitor conference last month. So maybe refresh us on that topic, please.\nThomas Peterffy: So we have looked at 2 specific opportunities, neither one of them have worked out. They wanted a higher price than\u2014no, actually, in one case, the target wanted more than we were willing to pay. And in the other case, they were not interested in doing anything. And since they have very strong voting power, there is nothing we can do. But we keep on looking. So if anybody hears of anything, please let us know.\nCraig Siegenthaler: And Thomas, also on the dividend, too, please.\nThomas Peterffy: We are not looking to increase the dividend. We are looking to increase the amount of money we have because it gives us greater\u2014 it gives our clients a greater sense of security. And as you have heard, we are hoping to get larger and larger investors to come with us and that security cushion is very important to them, especially since we are not a systematically important counterparty.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. And I think, Thomas, do I get a follow-up? Or is it just one?\nThomas Peterffy: As far as I'm concerned, go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: All right. Great. So my second one is on the expense side. Employee comp and benefits down about $9 million sequentially. So any comment on that? And is this a good run rate to work on for next quarter? And I think you also consolidated some European offices in the quarter. So, I don't know if that benefited this quarter or if that's going to benefit a future quarter?\nPaul Brody: Right. So Craig, we mentioned last quarter that there was an odd accounting requirement that we measure vacation days taken by employees around the world every quarter. And we accrue them at a certain rate, and then we subtract the days taken, and we have to take an expense for the difference. That tends to build up in the second quarter and then go back down in the third quarter as people take vacation over the summer. It only seems obvious to many of us. We have\u2014 so that unfortunately generates a little bit of quarter-to-quarter noise. We've done some research into this and determined that we can measure this annually instead of quarterly. Sort of anticipating that it does go up and down and employees do, in fact, take their vacations annually. And by the end of the year, it's mostly even again. So we're going to adopt that next year, starting with 2024 and you should stop seeing the quarter-to-quarter variations. And that accounted for $4-$5 million of the change upside and then downside\u2014 upside in the second quarter, downside in the third quarter. As far as consolidating offices or rather merging operations in Europe, we would not expect that to have a material impact. It's primarily driven by our desire to simplify our regulatory environment by having 1 regulator instead of 2, not driven by rationalizing the staff, as they say.\nMilan Galik: Let me clarify that a little bit. So your question was whether we are already seeing the benefits in the numbers of the consolidation. And the answer to that is no. The migration of the accounts to our Irish entity, as well as consolidation of the 2 entities into 1, is going to take anywhere between 6 and 9 months. At first, we are going to see a restructuring charge as we migrate the accounts to Ireland. We're going to be paying into an insurance fund. But after that, we are expecting to see the benefit of $7 million or so dollars per year that is direct cost savings aside from reduced distraction that we have to suffer because we have to pay attention to 2 European entities as opposed to 1. So the $7 million is a direct benefit, plus there are significant benefits by reducing the distraction and being able to focus on fewer entities.\nOperator: And our next question will be coming from Benjamin Budish of Barclays.\nBen Budish: Thomas, I wanted to ask if you could maybe clarify the sort of long-term account guidance you talked about. I think earlier last month at a presentation, you talked about sort of moving away from the 30% target to like a 20% plus. I'm just wondering how much of today's commentary is different from that? Is it sort of because you have less clarity around the timing of the i-broker accounts that you talked about before? Or is it sort of more of a material change in your longer-term outlook?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, no. I mean what happened was that initially, when these 2 introducing brokers came on the scene, I thought that they were both having more customers than they, in fact, do and that is aside of the fact that it is extremely cumbersome and a lengthy process to onboard the second one. Generally, I thought I went too far in guessing and saying, yes, I think that it's going to be 30%. I just have to come back and hands up to\u2014 that now I realize that I really don't know. I mean the fact is that we don't see into the future, and there is no big clock out there that tells me what it's going to be, right? So it remains a guess, but I think that I'd rather give you a more conservative guess, and I'm comfortable with 20%, 22%, 23%, 24%, maybe even 25%, but somewhere in the 20% to 25% range, I feel more comfortable.\nBen Budish: Got it. Well, I really appreciate the candor there. Maybe a follow-up on the options activity. Just curious if you can give any more color on like what the breakout of that is? Is it more opportunity outside the U.S.? Is it the shorter dated pieces? Is it your hedge fund clients or the retail clients? What are the key drivers of that? And just thinking about as we have kind of seen options activity grow over the last several years. How much more room do you think there is to go kind of based on all those pieces that you see?\nThomas Peterffy: So I think that options activity has a tremendous future because what has been going on in the United States, as you well know, is generally followed by other places around the world with a lag of 10, 20, 30 years. And so we see more and more interest outside of the United States, and we also\u2014there is now options trading overnight. So it's basically 24 hours a day, even though overnight, is still very little volume, but it's catching on. And I see a world in 5 to 10 years from now when options volume will be the same 24 hours, no matter what time of the day you're looking at it. And it is also true that, yes, short-term dated options, the larger\u2014the largest volume is in zero day options. And that's just what's happening.\nOperator: And our next question will be coming from Patrick Moley of Piper Sandler.\nPatrick Moley: Congrats on a strong quarter. So maybe just diving back into Ben's question. Can you maybe hammer in on the trend you're seeing in the 0DTE piece and maybe the flow buildout...\nThomas Peterffy: Hold it. Please, hold it. We do not understand your words. So it comes across very garbled. Could you please move whatever you're talking into further away from yourself?\nPatrick Moley: Yes, sure. So just was hoping we could maybe dive back into the 0DTE piece. Can you talk a little bit more about the breakout that you're seeing there, the flow between institutional and retail and the sustainability there and maybe what it means for growth going forward.\nThomas Peterffy: Well, between institutional and retail, I never quite understood how to categorize something into institutional versus retail. So when the account is opened in the name of an entity rather than a person, we call that institutional. Now as you know, introducing brokers are entities. So even though there are individuals at the other end of the process, so I cannot tell you the breakout between what's institutional, and what's retail. But there are certainly many, many trading shops that I assume basically are institutional who trade a lot of options.\nMilan Galik: Maybe I can give you a little bit of color. Perhaps it's going to be helpful. The way we participate, and our customers participate in these zero-day options\u2014 expiring options - is that we often send the customer orders into price improvement auctions. Now that requires that we first find liquidity for the customer\u2019s order from one of the market makers, one of the institutions that we are connected to. So a lot of the trading we do in these zero-day options, we have an institution on one side and a customer on the other side. It's not obviously 100% of the volume, but it's quite a bit of it. So in short, it's mixed participation.\nOperator: Our next question today will be coming from Brennan Hawken of UBS.\nBrennan Hawken: I'd actually like to follow up on that 0DTE and try and get some color from a different perspective. You mentioned that it was a material part of the option volume. Could you give some more specific color around what proportion 0DTE represents today versus maybe a year ago? And when you think about...\nThomas Peterffy: We do not measure that.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. Well, then that's straightforward. Maybe shifting to your perspective, Thomas. When you think about this product and its maturity, what inning do you think we are in its emergence and in its growth?\nThomas Peterffy: I think it takes\u2014 I would guess. Again, I'm just guessing. I mean I don't have anything more than anybody else does. I'm guessing that the relative proportion of zero-date and very short date options is going to probably remain the same, but overall option volume will keep increasing. And I think that it's probably going to increase by 5% to 10% a year going forward indefinitely.\nBrennan Hawken: That's overall option volume?\nThomas Peterffy: Yes.\nMilan Galik: And there is one interesting thing, if I could add. There is one interesting thing happening in Europe. The European exchanges were obviously observing this phenomenon in the United States with envy, and they are going to be listing zero-day options or 5-day options that are listed every day. So every day you will have an expiring option in cash-settled index options, and that's what they really are. So we will see some of the same phenomenon over time outside of the United States.\nThomas Peterffy: That is true, but European option volume\u2014 option volume on European exchanges is very, very tiny percentage of the total.\nMilan Galik: Indeed.\nBrennan Hawken: We'll see what envy can get us on that front. I'd like to\u2014 and I totally appreciate that this is really sort of challenging to nail down. But when you were answering the prior question about the introducing broker, Thomas, sort of a couple of other questions jump to mind. You mentioned that the\u2014 your sense of the size of one of the introducing brokers has changed. It's not as large as you thought. Was that\u2014I was kind of curious about what might cause that. Was that because maybe they aren't growing as fast as you had thought when you initially started to talk to them or that maybe the opportunity set to move a portion of their business over to Interactive is going to be just smaller than you had initially guessed?\nThomas Peterffy: To be quite frank, I was so enthusiastic when they first showed up on the scene, I estimated that they would have several million accounts. And now it turns out that they probably have hundreds of thousands of accounts.\nMilan Galik: Well, maybe a little bit different color. So what remains the same is the institution that we're talking about is one of the top multinational banks in the world by assets. So that remains the same. What we have learned recently is that instead of them bringing over a large chunk of the accounts that would be migrated from one broker to another, that's not what we're going to see. We're going to see very little of that. What the hope is, is that a lot of the banking clients of these global institutions are going to become self-directed investors on the platform this bank is integrating with us. So that's what really is changing. They are having hopes of turning their banking clients into brokerage clients.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Daniel Fannon of Jefferies.\nDaniel Fannon: Another question just on the account growth. I think, Thomas, you mentioned other introducing brokers that have signed up. Could you maybe talk to the discussions and/or the backlog of what might be smaller or the pipeline of how you were thinking about the broader introducing broker opportunity?\nThomas Peterffy: So there are several banks and brokerage firms around the world that have a relatively small customer base\u2014 it doesn't pay for them to develop the technology that's necessary to compete in this world today. So they are relatively easy to get onto our platform. And with our very automated platform, we hope that they will grow very quickly and other firms\u2014 other similar firms, seeing their situation, will either come along also or will drop out of the business. That's what I see.\nDaniel Fannon: Okay. And then I wanted to follow up on the conversation or topic of M&A. We\u2014 you have not been an acquirer previously. So could you talk to what it is you're looking for, how we should think about the return profile or accretion or economic kind of thresholds that you have for doing a transaction?\nThomas Peterffy: So we believe that by far, we have the most efficient operation and our technology is by far the best. So it would make sense that other firms that have less\u2014that are less automated \u2013 would benefit\u2014 I mean their overall daily operation would benefit coming onto our platform. So that would be the basic idea.\nMilan Galik: One additional strength that we have compared to the other players in this space is that we are global in terms of accessing the markets. So when an Asian or European institution integrates with us, they can serve not only access to the U.S. markets, but to their local markets as well.\nDaniel Fannon: And just a follow-up. Is there\u2014from a size or capacity, I mean is there a limit like in terms of what you're looking at? Are these small acquisition\u2014 small potential targets? Is it\u2014 just trying to get a sense of how big to think about what type of M&A you would be contemplating.\nMilan Galik: It all depends, right? So what we would obviously be looking at is what is the opportunity. Is it an institution that has relatively little automation and we can jump in and generate a lot of cost savings by automating the operations. Is it a large number of active accounts that they have. It all depends. So when we are presented with an opportunity, we look at the economics. We have usually a couple of ideas of how we would go about the integration. What is it that we would be looking for in the final outcome, and that determines the price we're willing to pay. Unfortunately, in one of the two cases that Thomas mentioned, we were short of the price that the seller was demanding. They haven't sold yet. They may come back to us, but it's unclear whether they will.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Chris Allen of Citi.\nChris Allen: One thing we've been watching is margin balances have been trending up nicely, even in September when the markets were down. And you noted the strength and interest income being driven by financial advisers and hedge funds earlier. On the financial adviser front, are you seeing any benefit from the Schwab-Ameritrade integration that's going on right now? On the hedge fund side, are you\u2014 is the existing hedge fund client base expanding in size? Are you winning new hedge fund clients?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, there are certainly\u2014 our salespeople speak a lot about the unhappiness of especially Ameritrade clients that had to go over to Schwab on the one hand. On the other, about Ameritrade clients who were Ameritrade clients in addition to Schwab clients because those clients wanted to have two independent brokerage firms and now that they are only one, they are looking for a second. So these are the two types of clients we are getting from this merger. Now your second question was about the hedge funds, what did you actually ask?\nChris Allen: Yes. Just wanted to know on the hedge fund size, are you seeing new hedge fund wins or the existing customer base...\nThomas Peterffy: Definitely. Yes. We definitely see new hedge fund wins, yes. They tend\u2014on balance to be smaller funds in the $10 million to $50 million range, and so we get them regularly and quite often.\nChris Allen: And just a quick follow-up on the M&A discussion. Are you looking at domestic opportunities, overseas, both? Basically what you do see out there?\nThomas Peterffy: It doesn't matter to us. We\u2019re going either way. We're happy to; we don't care whether it's US or outside.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from James Yaro of Goldman Sachs.\nJames Yaro: It's James Yaro. I think it's quite clear today what the opportunity is in terms of retail trading in Asia. But I think retail trading remains somewhat more subdued in Europe. You are investing in Europe clearly. So maybe you can just speak to your outlook for whether retail trading in Europe will accelerate and potentially over time, look more like what we see in the US and what gives you that sort of confidence?\nThomas Peterffy: Generally, I think that, as you know, the United States is basically the hot seat of capitalism and has a history of 200 years, right? In Europe, it has a somewhat longer history, but much more subdued history. So in Europe, traditionally people who invest in the stock market were a very small layer of society. And we expect that, that will expand just like it has expanded in the United States. On the other hand, the average European person has only about 60% to 70% of the funds that the average American person has.\nJames Yaro: Okay. That's very clear. And then if we were to potentially see Fed funds start to come down, and I'm not saying that's going to happen imminently. But just\u2014 maybe you could just speak to...\nThomas Peterffy: Sorry for the laugh. No. I believe that Fed funds will remain in the 5% range indefinitely for the very, very long term. They may come down to 4%, but then they will come up because there is nothing you can do about the ever increasing debt payments. So Fed funds will go to 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% until we go into the hole.\nJames Yaro: Okay. But the market forward curve obviously has cuts. So just\u2014 you obviously manage risks very well, Thomas. So I just want to understand how you think about let's say there's downside risk and rates do come down. How do you think about hedging that, if at all? Do you extend securities duration or do you need to do something else?\nThomas Peterffy: If forward rates go above nearby rates, we may go out forward. But as long as nearby rates are higher, we will not do so.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Kyle Voigt of KBW.\nKyle Voigt: Thomas, maybe the first one is for you. Just on your automatic share sale plan. I think that's been paused for most of 2023. Can you just kind of provide an update there on any plans to convert and sell shares? And also just remind us...\nThomas Peterffy: I have a number of\u2014a large number of shares that I have converted. I constantly and always have a sales program on file, and I have a target price, which is 20% under what I believe the fair price for the stock would be. We have not reached that point yet. So when we will, you will see sales from me.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. And that's all automatically set in the\u2014 this year\u2019s plan.\nThomas Peterffy: That\u2019s right.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. The second question is just on the expenses. Last quarter, you spoke about some of the very recent challenges you were seeing in hiring technology talent. Just wondering if you could provide an update there on the market for talent. Are you still seeing the same inflationary pressures that you spoke about last quarter? And how is your hiring plan progressing in 2023 at 5% head count growth versus where you expected it to be when this year started?\nMilan Galik: So we do not think about hiring in terms of budgeting the number of people that we have to hire in a particular year. It's much more short term than that. We always know the projects that we are currently working on, the projects that we have, that we would like to work on. We see how many people we need in various groups. There is obviously some amount of attrition that we have to deal with. And these are the factors that determine when we approve a new position and we go to the market and try to hire them. Recently, we have not had great difficulty finding people at the prices we thought that we would find them. So there is a little bit less competition for the talent compared to last year. But good technologists, the really good technologists are still hard to find and you have to pay up for them.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. And if I could just sneak one in at the end of the call here for Paul. Other income, I think, on an adjusted basis, was at $20 million. It was the highest in quite some time. Just wondering if you could provide any color on kind of what drove that line and what\u2014 if that's a good run rate or we should think about it kind of reverting lower from here?\nPaul Brody: So it's always difficult to talk about run rate on other income because the primary components are our currency diversification strategy, which obviously fluctuates with the dollar. And we have some other\u2014 we have some investments, a few substantial investments that also produced some variability. So in this quarter, it's not that hard to do the math. On our currency diversification, we lost about $17 million, and we made back $20-something million on investments. So the net of the whole thing was\u2014 I mean, together with other normal things, we still have small trading activities and so forth. So we look at other income of $27 million, but mostly that was because we had a non-repeat of last year's $40 million loss on the currency. They produce a lot of noise, which is why we exclude them when we report our non-GAAP numbers.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back over to Nancy Stuebe for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will talk to you next quarter end.\nOperator: Thank you all for joining today's conference call. You may all disconnect. And everyone, enjoy the rest of your evening.",

            "name": "Milan Galik",
            "content": "Let me clarify that a little bit. So your question was whether we are already seeing the benefits in the numbers of the consolidation. And the answer to that is no. The migration of the accounts to our Irish entity, as well as consolidation of the 2 entities into 1, is going to take anywhere between 6 and 9 months. At first, we are going to see a restructuring charge as we migrate the accounts to Ireland. We're going to be paying into an insurance fund. But after that, we are expecting to see the benefit of $7 million or so dollars per year that is direct cost savings aside from reduced distraction that we have to suffer because we have to pay attention to 2 European entities as opposed to 1. So the $7 million is a direct benefit, plus there are significant benefits by reducing the distraction and being able to focus on fewer entities. Maybe I can give you a little bit of color. Perhaps it's going to be helpful. The way we participate, and our customers participate in these zero-day options\u2014 expiring options - is that we often send the customer orders into price improvement auctions. Now that requires that we first find liquidity for the customer's order from one of the market makers, one of the institutions that we are connected to. So a lot of the trading we do in these zero-day options, we have an institution on one side and a customer on the other side. It's not obviously 100% of the volume, but it's quite a bit of it. So in short, it's mixed participation. And there is one interesting thing, if I could add. There is one interesting thing happening in Europe. The European exchanges were obviously observing this phenomenon in the United States with envy, and they are going to be listing zero-day options or 5-day options that are listed every day. So every day you will have an expiring option in cash-settled index options, and that's what they really are. So we will see some of the same phenomenon over time outside of the United States. Indeed. Well, maybe a little bit different color. So what remains the same is the institution that we're talking about is one of the top multinational banks in the world by assets. So that remains the same. What we have learned recently is that instead of them bringing over a large chunk of the accounts that would be migrated from one broker to another, that's not what we're going to see.

            "name": "Nancy Stuebe",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. Also joining us today are Milan Galik, our CEO, and Paul Brody, our CFO. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. Our robust operating metrics once again translated into strong financial results this quarter. Our account growth remained strong at 21%, while our client equity was up 29%. Net interest income reached a record, as did our total adjusted net revenues, which were over $1 billion for the third consecutive quarter. On the other hand, markets were down in nearly every country in the quarter, and trading volumes dropped. Low market volatility, customers moving to higher-priced stocks of companies with greater capitalization and overwhelming competitive strength, and a geopolitical environment that is increasingly uncertain, all led to lower DARTs. This meant that while we were able to increase our commission revenue slightly, reaching its fourth highest level in our history, it is still the case that investors are holding onto the same seven equities and not trading others actively. However, options volumes continue to be strong and option commissions were up the most this quarter, then came futures, while stock commission revenue dropped. As I've said previously, I do not expect this situation to reverse. There are several competing cross-currents in the markets. If you are a long-term investor, and looking 10 years out, what you want most is stability, and not to lose a lot of money. You want to put your assets in a politically, currency- and inflation-wise stable place. While historically that has been the US, the US will look less stable politically as the election approaches, and inflation will look worse because of wage increases and union issues as well as the increasing cost of carrying US government debt. As apparent US political stability weakens, people are less likely to invest in equities. On the other hand, there is the tax liability for US taxpayers on substantially appreciated stock prices, should that gain be realized. This background explains what we have been seeing lately in the markets. Our customers' top stock holdings, the Magnificent Seven, hasn't changed much but corresponding options activity has increased. In addition, we are seeing more and more investors getting into US treasuries. Generally, activity on our government and corporate bond platform has picked up appreciably. We do not see inflation coming down substantially, and still see interest rates staying at elevated levels for a long time, which will in turn increase spending to pay the interest on this debt, adding to inflationary pressures. It remains the case that investors globally are looking to the markets to stay ahead of inflation and uncertainty. More people want to invest in securities markets, hold their choice of currency in their accounts, and gain exposure to different countries, particularly the US, as a way to build wealth and security. We continue to advertise, and closely watch which outlets work the best for us. We have built an automated advertising system, where we measure the yield and use an algorithm to adjust spending on each channel where we advertise. Telling everyone about our 4.83% return on immediately available qualified cash may have prevented withdrawals but it barely helped to increase customer cash which grew only by a little more than 2% from the prior year. In terms of our client segments, our strongest ones for account growth have been individuals and proprietary traders, which have also shown the strongest growth in 12-month commission revenue, while financial advisors, individuals and introducing brokers have seen the strongest growth in net interest income. Geographically, Europe has seen the fastest account growth, followed by Asia, then the Americas. I would like to talk about our introducing broker segment. I spoke of two large accounts coming. I regret that now, because the timing of these accounts is out of our control and with the larger of the two, it is difficult to put an exact time on it. But we have so much else going on, that I feel it is a disservice to focus only on \u201cWhen? When? When?\u201d for this 1 client, when we have so many other promising items lined up. First, the smaller of the two i-brokers successfully began onboarding their approximately 52,000 accounts; so far more than half of them are with us, and we expect the bulk of the rest by the end of the year. Next, a couple of other introducing brokers are joining us. All this is to say \u2013 when that \u201cother\u201d i-broker starts to onboard, I will let you know. Until then, I cannot put a date on it \u2013 I have been wrong on the date for a while now, so it is unclear to me why you would want me to keep giving one! But unfortunately, it is not only the date I have been wrong on. I have also misestimated the size of these operations. They now, both appear to be smaller than I originally expected and accordingly, I need to reduce my estimate of long term account growth from 30% to the low 20% area. On the hedge fund side, the most recent Preqin statistics show us moving into the number 5 position in terms of number of hedge funds for which we serve as prime broker. We were once again the fastest-growing of the top prime brokers this year. We plan to be #4 next year, behind only Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan. Our developers have been extremely busy with new products and tools, and have a full plate for the remainder of the year. This quarter, we: Introduced fractional shares trading for Canadian stocks and ETFs; Launched a Securities Lending dashboard for our more sophisticated clients to be able to assess short selling activity for specific securities and inform their decision-making; Introduced the next-generation IBKR Desktop trading platform; Launched the \u201cDiscover\u201d tool, to help clients find opportunities based on their own customized settings and trading preferences; Started our \u201cCents of Security\u201d podcast, designed to help improve financial literacy for newer investors; and Introduced long-term investment accounts in Hungary. We remain very optimistic about what our business model \u2013 international market access, a strong and secure balance sheet, and multiple features and tools, all at low prices with high interest paid on cash balances \u2013 offers to clients and potential clients around the world. In an increasingly uncertain world, the greater degrees of freedom our clients have to manage their portfolios as they wish, the better their ability to educate themselves as events change and economies increasingly fluctuate and diverge, the better off they will be. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul? Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will talk to you next quarter end."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Paul Brody",
            "content": "Welcome, everyone, to the call. As usual, starting with our Revenue items on page 3 of the release, we followed on our strong first and second quarter performances with net revenues reaching over $1.1 billion. With ongoing customer account and balance sheet growth, we continue to build a strong base for revenue growth in the future. Commissions were $333 million, up 4% from the year-ago quarter despite industry-wide declines in equities volume. Our options volumes, in particular, came in at a quarterly high, doubling the pace of industry volume growth. Stock share volumes declined from last year's quarter, once again driven by a drop in trading of lower-priced stocks, but also reflective of lower industry volumes. Net interest income was a quarterly record $733 million, reflecting higher interest on margin loans and segregated cash. These gains were partially offset by the higher interest we paid on customer credit balances, as our longstanding policy is to pass through rate hikes above 50 basis points to our customers on their qualified funds. Other fees and services generated $52 million, with the biggest contributors being market data fee revenue of $17 million, risk exposure fee revenue of $13 million, and options exchange liquidity payments of $8 million. The $8 million overall increase in risk exposure fees from the prior year quarter was driven by more risk-on positioning of customers. Other income was $27 million and includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings, and without these excluded items, Other income was $20 million for the quarter. Turning to expenses, Execution, Clearing & Distribution costs rose 14% versus last year, led by higher volumes in options, which carry higher fees than equities. We measure the profitability of our commissions by looking at Gross Transactional Profit, which is Commission revenue less Execution & Clearing costs. This measure excludes market data expense, which is a pass-through. In the third quarter, Execution & Clearing costs were 23% of commission revenue, for a Gross Transactional Profit margin of 77%. Compensation & Benefits expense rose 14% over the prior year quarter, on a combination of a 5% increase in average headcount and also on inflation. Compensation & Benefits expense was 11% of our adjusted Net Revenues, versus 13% last year, and below its historical level. Our headcount at quarter-end was 2,927. G&A expenses returned to a more typical level this quarter after we recorded a reserve in the second quarter for regulatory matters, which have since been settled. Versus the prior year-quarter, increases were related to advertising and legal expenses, partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees. Our adjusted pretax margin was 73%, up from 68% in the year-ago quarter. Income tax expense of $68 million reflects the sum of the public company's $36 million and the operating companies' $32 million. Moving to our balance sheet on page 5 of our release, our total assets were $121 billion at the end of the quarter, with growth over last year driven primarily by increases in our margin lending and securities lending businesses. We maintain a balance sheet aimed at supporting our growing businesses and providing ample financial resources during volatile markets, with maximum flexibility and short-term liquidity. We have no long-term debt and the duration of our U.S. investment portfolio at September 30th was 26 days. In our operating data, on pages 6 and 7, our contract volumes for all customers were strong, with options reaching their highest quarterly level, up 18% from a year ago. Futures contract volumes were down slightly, in line with industry volumes. And in stocks, the drop off of 22% was largely attributable to investors moving to higher quality stocks, as trading in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks declined the most. On page 7, you can see that our account growth remains robust, with over 140,000 net account adds in the quarter and total accounts at 2.4 million, up 21% over the prior year. Total Customer DARTs were 1.9 million trades per day, down slightly from the prior-year quarter. Our Cleared IBKR Pro Customers paid an average of $3.11 Commission per Cleared Commissionable Order, up 5% from last year as our clients' volume mix included higher per order contributions from options and futures. Page 8 presents our Net Interest Margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income rose 55% to $733 million from the year-ago quarter, reflecting stronger earnings on segregated cash and margin loans, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. With one more 25 basis point hike in the latest quarter, the average Federal funds rate was over 300 basis points higher this year than last. Many other central banks also raised rates this quarter. This group includes the UK, Canada, Hong Kong and the Eurozone. Net interest earned on segregated cash was $728 million, up $500 million from last year, primarily from global rate hikes. Maintaining a short duration on our invested funds continued to allow us to closely match asset and liability maturities and pick up benchmark rate increases quickly. As I said, at September 30th, our US portfolio duration was 26 days, so the investments have rolled over into new, higher rates with a fairly short lag time. A 5% increase over the year ago quarter in average segregated cash and securities balances also helped drive interest income higher. Margin loan interest rose to $623 million, nearly doubling the prior year quarter, despite average margin loan balances rising only slightly. Higher rates, in the US and internationally, have driven higher margin interest income. Securities lending net interest was $66 million, down from the year-ago quarter due both to lighter overall demand for so-called \u201chard-to-borrow\u201d stocks, and to a rate dynamic we have noted previously: namely, as benchmark rates rise, a greater portion of the revenue generated by lending securities, for which we receive cash collateral that we invest as segregated funds, is categorized as interest on Segregated Cash. We estimate this impact to be about $28 million for the quarter vs last year. In other words, without this shift in reporting line items, net interest from securities lending would have been $94 million, versus $114 million in the year-ago quarter. Interest on Customer Credit Balances, or the interest we pay our customers, grew as higher rates in many currencies led to our paying interest on qualifying balances as we pass through rate increases. We paid $832 million to our customers on their balances in the third quarter. Fully rate sensitive balances were up about 5% from the second quarter, at $21 billion. We consider our policy offering clients a full pass-through of all rate hikes after the first 50 basis points on their qualified cash a significant component in our success, and one that continues to set us apart. We believe this leads to clients choosing to keep their cash with us, especially active clients who do not want to use sweep programs that prevent them from immediately accessing their cash to invest. Now, for our estimates of the impact of increases in rates\u2014increases and decreases. Given market expectations of near-term rate hikes and further out rate reductions, we estimate the effects of both increases and decreases in the Fed Funds rate on our net interest income. We estimate increases in the Fed Funds rate to produce additional annual net interest income of approximately $56 million for each 25 basis point increase in the benchmark. Symmetrically, decreases in the Fed Funds rate should reduce annual net interest income by approximately $56 million for each 25 basis point decrease in the benchmark. Note that our starting point for these estimates is September 30th, with the Fed Funds effective rate at 5.33%, and based on balances at that date. About 25% of our customer cash balances is not in US dollars, so estimates of US rate change effects exclude those currencies. We estimate increases in all the relevant non-USD benchmark rates to produce additional annual net interest income of approximately $20 million for each 25 basis point increase in the benchmarks. In conclusion, the company performed well in the third quarter in a complex and uncertain environment, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base and deliver our core services to customers, at low costs and competitive interest rates, as we manage the business effectively with strong controls over risk and operating expenses. And with that, we will turn it over to our moderator and happy to take questions. Right. So Craig, we mentioned last quarter that there was an odd accounting requirement that we measure vacation days taken by employees around the world every quarter. And we accrue them at a certain rate, and then we subtract the days taken, and we have to take an expense for the difference. That tends to build up in the second quarter and then go back down in the third quarter as people take vacation over the summer. It only seems obvious to many of us. We have\u2014 so that unfortunately generates a little bit of quarter-to-quarter noise. We've done some research into this and determined that we can measure this annually instead of quarterly. Sort of anticipating that it does go up and down and employees do, in fact, take their vacations annually. And by the end of the year, it's mostly even again. So we're going to adopt that next year, starting with 2024 and you should stop seeing the quarter-to-quarter variations. And that accounted for $4-$5 million of the change upside and then downside\u2014 upside in the second quarter, downside in the third quarter. As far as consolidating offices or rather merging operations in Europe, we would not expect that to have a material impact. It's primarily driven by our desire to simplify our regulatory environment by having 1 regulator instead of 2, not driven by rationalizing the staff, as they say. So it's always difficult to talk about run rate on other income because the primary components are our currency diversification strategy, which obviously fluctuates with the dollar. And we have some other\u2014 we have some investments, a few substantial investments that also produced some variability. So in this quarter, it's not that hard to do the math. On our currency diversification, we lost about $17 million, and we made back $20-something million on investments. So the net of the whole thing was\u2014 I mean, together with other normal things, we still have small trading activities and so forth. So we look at other income of $27 million, but mostly that was because we had a non-repeat of last year's $40 million loss on the currency. They produce a lot of noise, which is why we exclude them when we report our non-GAAP numbers."

            "content": "So we have looked at 2 specific opportunities, neither one of them have worked out. They wanted a higher price than\u2014no, actually, in one case, the target wanted more than we were willing to pay. And in the other case, they were not interested in doing anything. And since they have very strong voting power, there is nothing we can do. But we keep on looking. So if anybody hears of anything, please let us know. We are not looking to increase the dividend. We are looking to increase the amount of money we have because it gives us greater\u2014 it gives our clients a greater sense of security. And as you have heard, we are hoping to get larger and larger investors to come with us and that security cushion is very important to them, especially since we are not a systematically important counterparty. As far as I'm concerned, go ahead. Well, no. I mean what happened was that initially, when these 2 introducing brokers came on the scene, I thought that they were both having more customers than they, in fact, do and that is aside of the fact that it is extremely cumbersome and a lengthy process to onboard the second one. Generally, I thought I went too far in guessing and saying, yes, I think that it's going to be 30%. I just have to come back and hands up to\u2014 that now I realize that I really don't know. I mean the fact is that we don't see into the future, and there is no big clock out there that tells me what it's going to be, right? So it remains a guess, but I think that I'd rather give you a more conservative guess, and I'm comfortable with 20%, 22%, 23%, 24%, maybe even 25%, but somewhere in the 20% to 25% range, I feel more comfortable. So I think that options activity has a tremendous future because what has been going on in the United States, as you well know, is generally followed by other places around the world with a lag of 10, 20, 30 years. And so we see more and more interest outside of the United States, and we also\u2014there is now options trading overnight. So it's basically 24 hours a day, even though overnight, is still very little volume, but it's catching on. And I see a world in 5 to 10 years from now when options volume will be the same 24 hours, no matter what time of the day you're looking at it. And it is also true that, yes, short-term dated options, the larger\u2014the largest volume is in zero day options. And that's just what's happening. Hold it. Please, hold it. We do not understand your words. So it comes across very garbled. Could you please move whatever you're talking into further away from yourself? Well, between institutional and retail, I never quite understood how to categorize something into institutional versus retail. So when the account is opened in the name of an entity rather than a person, we call that institutional. Now as you know, introducing brokers are entities. So even though there are individuals at the other end of the process, so I cannot tell you the breakout between what's institutional, and what's retail. But there are certainly many, many trading shops that I assume basically are institutional who trade a lot of options. We do not measure that. I think it takes\u2014 I would guess. Again, I'm just guessing. I mean I don't have anything more than anybody else does. I'm guessing that the relative proportion of zero-date and very short date options is going to probably remain the same, but overall option volume will keep increasing. And I think that it's probably going to increase by 5% to 10% a year going forward indefinitely. Yes. That is true, but European option volume\u2014 option volume on European exchanges is very, very tiny percentage of the total. To be quite frank, I was so enthusiastic when they first showed up on the scene, I estimated that they would have several million accounts. And now it turns out that they probably have hundreds of thousands of accounts. So there are several banks and brokerage firms around the world that have a relatively small customer base\u2014 it doesn't pay for them to develop the technology that's necessary to compete in this world today. So they are relatively easy to get onto our platform. And with our very automated platform, we hope that they will grow very quickly and other firms\u2014 other similar firms, seeing their situation, will either come along also or will drop out of the business. That's what I see. So we believe that by far, we have the most efficient operation and our technology is by far the best. So it would make sense that other firms that have less\u2014that are less automated \u2013 would benefit\u2014 I mean their overall daily operation would benefit coming onto our platform. So that would be the basic idea. Well, there are certainly\u2014 our salespeople speak a lot about the unhappiness of especially Ameritrade clients that had to go over to Schwab on the one hand. On the other, about Ameritrade clients who were Ameritrade clients in addition to Schwab clients because those clients wanted to have two independent brokerage firms and now that they are only one, they are looking for a second. So these are the two types of clients we are getting from this merger. Now your second question was about the hedge funds, what did you actually ask? Definitely. Yes. We definitely see new hedge fund wins, yes. They tend\u2014on balance to be smaller funds in the $10 million to $50 million range, and so we get them regularly and quite often. It doesn't matter to us. We're going either way. We're happy to; we don't care whether it's US or outside. Generally, I think that, as you know, the United States is basically the hot seat of capitalism and has a history of 200 years, right? In Europe, it has a somewhat longer history, but much more subdued history. So in Europe, traditionally people who invest in the stock market were a very small layer of society. And we expect that, that will expand just like it has expanded in the United States. On the other hand, the average European person has only about 60% to 70% of the funds that the average American person has. Sorry for the laugh. No. I believe that Fed funds will remain in the 5% range indefinitely for the very, very long term. They may come down to 4%, but then they will come up because there is nothing you can do about the ever increasing debt payments. So Fed funds will go to 5%, 6%, 7%, 8%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% until we go into the hole. If forward rates go above nearby rates, we may go out forward. But as long as nearby rates are higher, we will not do so. I have a number of\u2014a large number of shares that I have converted. I constantly and always have a sales program on file, and I have a target price, which is 20% under what I believe the fair price for the stock would be. We have not reached that point yet. So when we will, you will see sales from me. That's right."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Nancy Stuebe. Please go ahead.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. Also joining us today are, Milan Galik, our CEO, and Paul Brody, our CFO. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. Our robust operating metrics once again translated into strong financial results this quarter. In fact, but for a substantial addition to reserves for legal contingencies, we would have posted record adjusted pretax income. Our account growth remained strong at 19% while our client equity was up 24%. Margin loans have increased over the course of 2023 as investors are feeling more confident in the markets after down year in 2022. Our net interest income reached a record, as did our total adjusted net revenues, which were over $1 billion this quarter. On the other hand, trading volumes dropped this quarter, and with that dropped our commissions by 10% from the first quarter. Lower commissions prevailed across the board. Option commissions decreased the least, then came futures and stock commissions dropped the most. I do not expect the situation to reverse. Our clients are most heavily weighted in the Magnificent Seven where they luckily have huge unrealized gains that they are not likely to want to realize. As a result, I expect a lot of calls to be written in the coming quarters in these stocks. When the stocks rise further, the calls will be repurchased. And when they fall, they will lapse. In this way, our option commissions will benefit and our stock commissions will continue to suffer. Investors voted to put their money into big tech stocks rather than keeping it at banks at near zero returns. As usual, we do not know how well our advertising worked. Telling everyone about our 4.58% return on immediately available qualified cash may have prevented more and larger withdrawals, but it barely helped to increase customer cash, which grew only by a little more than 2% over the first quarter As I have mentioned before, I still believe inflation is going to stay with us. And while there may be a pause in rate hikes, this is not a short-term state of affairs that will soon result in rate cuts. The debt has increased by $1 trillion since Congress raised the debt limit. Interest on US debt cost over $650 billion over just the past nine months. Annualized, this comes close to $1 trillion a year. This increased spending will drive inflation, which will lead to higher rates, which will in turn increase spending and so on. In terms of our client segments, our strongest ones for account growth have been individuals, proprietary traders and hedge funds. These have also shown the strongest growth in 12-month commissions revenue while individuals, prop traders and financial advisors have been the strongest drivers of net interest income. We are still looking to onboard the first of the two large introducing broker accounts this year, hopefully in the third quarter. It will start slowly and we hope to see it completed within a few months of its start. Our dates are slipping with respect to the second large introducing broker, but we are still hoping to begin onboarding them before year-end. Our developers have been extremely busy with new products and tools, and have a full plate for the remainder of the year. One area we are focused on is delivering specific tools to specific customer types. For financial advisors, we introduced customized indexing, making it easy to build stock portfolios modeled on ETFs that are customizable for tax efficiency and investment goals. Customized indexing clients will own fractional shares of each component stock, so the adviser can adjust weightings, capitalize on gains or losses for tax purposes or exclude specific stocks or sectors, personalizing as their clients need. We also introduced a tax harvesting tool, a streamlined CRM and now offer our RIAs research from ISI Evercore. We do not require minimums. We have no ticket charges and charge no custodial technology, software, platform or reporting fees. For individuals in introducing broker clients, we expanded overnight trading in US stocks and ETFs and now have over 10,000 names available. This has been particularly attractive for our clients in those time zones where investing during regular US trading hours is difficult. For a more sophisticated clients and funds, we introduced our securities lending dashboard, which allows them to access the same expanded securities lending data and key metrics for US equities that historically were only available to banks, broker dealers and large institutional investors. Internationally, we added the Taiwan Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Copenhagen and the Prague Stock Exchange to our platform while fractional share trading will soon be available for Canadian stocks and ETFs. We remain committed to having the most informed clients wherever they are in their investing journey. Our IBKR Campus educational website has the courses, webinars, podcasts and market commentaries to assist our clients in learning more about trading, the economy and financial markets from the most basic educational fundamentals, sophisticated strategies and market commentary. They can learn more about Interactive Brokers trading tools and how to use them. Our Learn and Earn program lets clients who are new to a particular securities product earn commission credits for each bundle of courses they complete. We remain very optimistic about what our business model, international market access, strong and secure balance sheet, multiple features and tools at low prices and high interest paid on cash balances, offers to clients and potential clients around the world. We are extremely disappointed that we did not achieve a new record in the second quarter and we were determined to redouble our efforts and get there in the third. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul?\nPaul Brody: Thank you, Nancy. Thanks everyone for joining the call. As usual, we'll start with our revenue items in Page 3 of the release. We followed on our strong first quarter performance, recording net revenues of $1 billion in the current quarter. With ongoing customer account and balance sheet growth, we continue to build a strong base for both commission and interest revenues in the future. Commissions were $322 million, level with the year-ago quarter despite industry-wide declines in volumes for futures and especially for equities. Our futures and options volumes came in at -- in near their quarterly highs, while stock share volumes declined from last year's quarter, once again driven by a drop in trading of lower priced stocks. Net interest income was a quarterly record $694 million, reflecting higher interest on margin loans and segregated cash from both increases in benchmark rates and larger segregated cash portfolio. US benchmark rates have moved from an average effective rate of 77 basis points in the second quarter of last year to 499 basis points this quarter. These gains were partially offset by the higher interest we paid on customer credit balances as our long-standing policy is to pass through rate hikes above 50 basis points to our customers on their qualified funds. Other fees and services generated $47 million, with the biggest contributors being market data fees of $18 million, risk exposure fee revenue of $10 million and options exchange liquidity payments of $7 million. The increase in risk exposure fees from the prior year quarter was driven by more risk-on positioning of customers, which led to a $4 million rise in these fees. Other income was a loss of $63 million and includes gains and losses on our investment, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings and without these excluded items, other income was a $1 million gain for the quarter. Turning to expenses, execution clearing and distribution costs rose 21% versus last year, led by higher volumes in options, which carry higher fees, the non-recurrence of last year's $3 million OCC clearing fee rebate and a $1 million increase in market data fees, as well as lower liquidity rebates. We find it useful to measure what we call gross transactional profit, which is commissions less execution and clearing costs directly related to trading, which excludes primarily market data distribution fees. As a percent of commission revenues, execution and clearing costs, which are driven by a combination of trading volume, exchange rebates and changing fee schedules, were at 22% this quarter for a gross transactional profit margin of 78%. Market data expense, a pass-through item, is included in execution clearing and distribution fees line item, while the corresponding market data revenue is reported in other fees and services rather than in commission. For this purpose, in the second quarter, we exclude $15 million in market data expense. Compensation and benefits expense rose 21% over the prior year quarter on a combination of staffing increases and inflation. While up in dollar terms for the quarter, comp and benefits expense remained at 13% of our adjusted net revenues versus 16% last year and somewhat below its historical level. Our headcount at quarter-end was 2,908. G&A expenses roughly doubled versus last year's second quarter, largely attributable to a substantial increase in reserves related to the previously disclosed regulatory investigation into the use of unapproved electronic messaging and the firm\u2019s record keeping requirements. Without that increase, G&A expenses would be down slightly year-on-year. Our adjusted pretax margin was 67%, up from 63% in the year-ago quarter. While higher interest rates benefit us, automation remains our key means of maintaining consistently high margin. Income tax expense of $51 million reflects the sum of the public company\u2019s $30 million and the operating company\u2019s $21 million. Moving to our balance sheet on Page 5 of our release. Our total assets were $121 billion at the end of the quarter, with growth over last year driven primarily by increases in our segregated cash and securities. We maintain a balance sheet aimed at supporting our growing business and providing ample financial resources during volatile markets with maximum flexibility and short-term liquidity. We have no long-term debt. The duration of our investment portfolio as of June 30th was 40 days. Turning to our operating data on pages 6 and 7. Our contract volumes for all customers were strong, reaching their fourth highest quarterly level in options, up 9% over the year-ago quarter. Futures contract and stock share volumes were down 3% and 28% respectively. Options and futures volumes were generally in line with industry volume. And in stocks, the drop-off was largely attributable to investors moving to higher quality stocks as trading in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks was impacted most. On Page 7, you can see that our account growth remains robust with over 95,000 net account adds in the quarter and total accounts of 2.3 million, up 19% over the prior year. Total customer DARTs were 1.9 million trades per day, down 14% from the stronger prior year quarter. Our cleared IBKR Pro customers paid an average of $3.11 commission per cleared commissionable order, up 14% from last year as our client's volume mix included higher per order contributions from nearly all product categories, particularly from options and futures. Page 8 presents our net interest margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income nearly doubled to $694 million on the year-ago quarter, reflecting stronger earnings on segregated cash and margin loans, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balance. After a series of seven target rate increases in 2022, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 25 basis points three times this year. And many other central banks also raised this quarter. This group includes the UK, Canada, Australia, and Hong Kong, as well as the Eurozone and Switzerland. Net interest on segregated cash was $700 million, primarily due to federal reserve rate hikes, but also to our managing short duration on invested funds, which has allowed us to more closely match asset and liability maturities and to pick up benchmark rate increases quickly. At June 30, our US portfolio duration was 40 days, so the investments have rolled over into new higher rates with a fairly short lag time. A 21% increase over the year-ago quarter in average segregated cash and securities balances also drove interest income higher. Margin loan interest rose to $547 million, up significantly from $197 million last year despite average margin loan balances declining 11% from last year's second quarter. Higher rates in the US and internationally have driven higher margin interest income. Securities lending net interest was $79 million, down from the year-ago quarter due to a dynamic we have noted previously. While securities lending opportunities maintained a relatively strong pace, it's also the case that as benchmark rates rise, a greater portion of the revenue generated by securities lending, for which we receive cash collateral that we invest as segregated funds is reflected as interest on segregated cash. We estimate this impact to be about $40 million for the quarter versus last year. In other words, without this shift in reporting line items, net interest from securities lending would be $119 million, up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Interest on customer credit balances or the interest we pay our customers grew as higher rates in many currencies led to our paying interest on qualifying balances as we pass through rate increases. We paid $774 million to our customers on their balances in the second quarter. Fully rate sensitive balances were roughly unchanged at about $20 billion. We consider our policy offering clients a full pass-through of all rate hikes after the first 50 basis points on their qualified cash, a significant component in our success and one that continues to set us apart. We believe this leads to clients choosing to keep their cash with us, especially active clients who do not want to use sweep programs that prevent them from immediately accessing their cash to invest. Now for our estimates of the impact of increases in rates, given market expectations of possibly one or more rate hikes to come, we estimate the effect of increases in the Fed funds rate to produce an additional annual net interest income of approximately $49 million for each 25 basis points increase in the benchmark. Note that our starting point for these estimates is June 30, with the Fed funds effective rate at 5.08% and also based on balances at that date. About 25% of our customer cash balances is not in US dollars. So estimates of US rate change in fact exclude these currencies. We estimate increases in all the relevant non-USD benchmarks rate to produce additional annual net interest income of $26 million for each 25 basis point increase in the benchmarks. In conclusion, the company performed well in the second quarter in a complex and uncertain environment, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base and deliver on our core services to customers, all at a low cost and while offering meaningful cash interest, as we manage the business effectively with strong controls over risk and operating expense. And with that, we'll turn it over to moderator and we will take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Benjamin Budish of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi, thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe first on the marketing spend, you indicated it's not entirely clear if it's working the way you hoped. Can you maybe talk about kind of your commitment to continuing with that? And maybe for Paul, just I think you had previously indicated that there would be a bit of a step-up quarter-over-quarter, but when we sort of subtract the reserve charge that you took, it looks like the step-up maybe wasn't as big. So how much of that spend was in the quarter? And what are your thoughts in sort of continuing with that strategy?\nThomas Peterffy: Are you asking about marketing, expenses or the reserves?\nBenjamin Budish: The marketing expense. So I think if you back out --\nThomas Peterffy: Yeah, the marketing expense, yes, we're definitely going to stick with our marketing program and we will increase marketing spend gradually quarter after quarter after quarter, we will spend more and more money marketing as we find out marketing outlets that we believe to be -- although we cannot precisely measure it, but we believe to be a positive impact.\nBenjamin Budish: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe, Thomas, just to kind of pick your brain on the sort of the customer trading behavior. What do you -- it sounds like you're expecting things to be a little less active in the back half of the year. What do you think kind of reverses that? Is it sort of a decline in rates? Is it just more broader macro volatility? What sort of indicators should we be looking for, maybe like with your unique customer segment that might drive more of a pickup there?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, I think that what is coming down the pike is more technology driven order flow. And that as more AI systems get behind money management, I think that as a result of that trading activity will pick up. There will be more and more small orders, there will be more and more fractional shareholders, there will be more and more registered investment advisers who will hire technology driven systems to drive their investment choices. And so that's what I see in the future.\nBenjamin Budish: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. I wanted to get an update on your prospecting effort in the introducing broker channel. I am really trying to gauge a potential to translate some of these prospects into IBKR customers. And maybe one thing you can share with us if you can is like how many prospective meetings you have done in the first half of the year?\nMilan Galik: Thank you for your question. Interactive -- introducing brokers have always been an important segment for our business. That is what our sales force focuses on. We have many prospects in the pipeline in various stages of the development. With some, we are still discussing the best way to connect and integrate with us. Others are already doing test trace on our platform and the most advanced ones are already at the stage of getting their customers into the production trading. Not much has changed, other than we continue to focus on the ibroker segment and we are continuously making software development changes that make the integration easier and so that we can offer them more choices for the integration going forward.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks, Milan. Do I get a second question or is it just one question we\u2019ve got?\nMilan Galik: Go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. Okay. So my follow-up is, given slowing growth on a cyclical basis in the active trader channel relative to accelerating growth in the introducing broker vertical, can you talk about how you expect it to impact your profitability or even revenue growth relative to account growth?\nThomas Peterffy: Yeah. So look, the introducing broker client is always the least profitable client. The actual client is always the most profitable client and the prop traders are our sweet spot. So yes, to the extent that our number of accounts will jump in number, the profitability will not similarly increase. Profitability comes mostly from our most sophisticated professional client base, which is by the way also -- is increasing quite well.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Thomas.\nOperator: Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from Daniel Fannon of Jefferies LLC. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Fannon: Thank you. I was hoping to follow-up on that and just think about maybe get a sense of the activity levels or how active you think the introducing broker relationships are when they come on board and the maturation to think about new other customers I think you've talked about previously as they get comfortable with the platform and they trade more over time. Is that still similar when you think about the IB channel and is there a way to put some numbers around that?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, I\u2019ll put some numbers around it. Let me put it this way. So our average account yields about $1,200 of revenues per year. The average introducing broker account, GI, I'm guessing here -- for every introducing broker account, I would expect them to be around $300 to $400 a year. And the -- you know, you're asking to put numbers around it. I do not have these numbers in front of me, unfortunately. So I really -- I'm embarrassed I can\u2019t tell you.\nDaniel Fannon: Understood. That's okay. I guess a more specific modeling question for Paul. Just in terms of the other income, it's moved around a lot in recent quarters is $1 million when we adjust everything out. What's a reasonable level or as you think about like a baseline level going forward to model for?\nPaul Brody: Well, I think it's not that variable when you take out our non-GAAP adjustments, right, which is primarily the currency impact and partially from mark to market on US government securities. And by the way, that's not -- that's smaller than it used to be given that our duration is so short. So we report to you which items we've taken out. And if you take those out, you probably get a reasonable baseline. But other income is also some miscellaneous investments and things that are not very predictable, but after those large items, the whole category is not very large.\nDaniel Fannon: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from Patrick Moley of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nPatrick Moley: Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just one on, last quarter you had the security sale. Just wondering if you could quantify the impact from that reinvestment had on net interest income in the current quarter.\nPaul Brody: I don't think we could say that precisely. You're talking about when we liquidated some treasuries, reinvested them in shorter term\nPatrick Moley: Yes, you did.\nPaul Brody: Yeah, I mean, we recognized the liquidated loss and obviously reinvested at short-term current treasury rates and, if you look at the yield curve, you know what those are. So, yes, we're making it back for sure.\nPatrick Moley: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen of Citi. Please go ahead.\nChris Allen: Good evening, everyone. I had a couple of follow-ups. On the other income, is there any legacy market making still left in there? I know there was when you sold the business and that's where it got recorded and those drove some principal transactions. Is that still on that other income line?\nPaul Brody: Yes, it's still in there and it's a very minor contributor to the total.\nChris Allen: Understood. And then just on the duration of the US investment portfolio, you noted it was 40 days. If I recall correctly last quarter, you had sold some securities and reinvest and I think the duration was 24 days. So based on those, obviously you are looking at extending a little bit, obviously nothing crazy or anything like that. Do I have that correct? Was this a function of any extension or is this just a function of maybe stuff maturing and new cash coming on?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, it all has to do with -- when the Fed is scheduled to move. So we do not want to speculate on what the Fed is going to do. So we like to -- we prefer to invest before the Fed date or if the Fed like in this case said that they are going to raise a quarter we believe them that they are going to raise a quarter and given that the market believes 98% that they are going to raise quarter, we don't mind to go over that date, but not the subsequent date. So we are still before we are investing to prior -- to our investment will mature before the September Fed meeting.\nChris Allen: Understood. Thanks a lot. That was it for me.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good evening. Maybe just a question on the compensation expense. So that headcount was up, I think roughly 5% year-on-year. Comp looks up closer to 20%. I just want to make sure that there were no one-offs, Paul, in the comp line or anything to know from a one-off standpoint. And also I just want to clarify that the entirety of the kind of one-offs and legal reserve were in the G&A line specifically.\nPaul Brody: Right. So on the comp and you're right to ask this question. So it's not specifically a one-off, but there is some expense in there for -- we have to expense accrued vacation days of staff that have not yet been taken. So each quarter, we measure the accruals, which are at a fairly consistent rate versus days taken and they tend to be smaller in the second quarter and then people tend to take vacation in the third quarter. And each quarter we have to recognize an expense, so the difference between those two. It happened to be that in the second quarter, the difference was larger than usual. And so there is -- probably the impact is 2% or 3% on that 21% that came from that, we would expect it to return maybe even in the third quarter, depends on when people take a vacation. And then, of course, inflation figures into all of that and we had a headcount increase. So that gets us the most of the rest.\nKyle Voigt: I guess when you're thinking about this year versus last year, I guess we're hearing from some others that may be the hiring environment is getting a bit better. They're seeing a little bit less inflation in terms of staffing costs, less and less competitive environment. I guess when we look at your 2022 figures, it seems like there's maybe a little bit less inflationary pressures, I guess relative to the headcount that you grew. And in 2022, it seems to be more of a diversion this year, but I know there's other factors in there. So just wanted to know if you could kind of maybe parse out what you're seeing from a hiring standpoint. Are you having to pay up to retain employees et cetera? Kind of what's really driving that and how the environment maybe has changed from 2022 to 2023 on the inflationary side?\nMilan Galik: In 2022, at the end of the year, when we pay our employees the bonuses and adjust their base salaries for the next year, we had to award significant increases in response to the inflation. At the beginning of this year, we thought that we were going to have an easier time hiring, especially the tech people after the lay-offs were announced by the big tech companies. That unfortunately did not last long. Very recently, let's say the last month, we have had occasions where we had made what we thought to be competitive offers to some information technology applicants that were declined. So there are lots of jobs out there, again, especially in the tech area and we have to pay attention and we have to pay what it takes to get the talent in the door. In this last quarter, we managed to hire 33 of -- net 36 more employees than the quarter before, approximately half of them are in the technology space, the rest of them are in client services and compliance.\nKyle Voigt: That's great color. Thanks for that. And I guess, does that change your view or inform your opinion as to like how we should think really about those -- the fixed expense growth for the business. I think, first quarter is trending towards 10%, seems I think it was closer to 15% when we kind of back out the legal expense in the second quarter. I guess, is there a right kind of, in the environment that we're in today, is there a right way to think about that kind of total fixed expense growth as we look ahead over the next, let's call it 18 to 24 months?\nMilan Galik: No. I think one measure that you could use would be the core inflation rate. We do not want to stay behind. We want our employees to maintain their standard of living. We want to remain competitive so that we have significant talent in our offices helping us build our systems for the future. So to the extent that the inflation stays with us or increases, we are going to be responding to that just like to the market forces. If the competing companies pick up their hiring and we will have to compete for the talent, we will do so. We are a technology company at its heart and we will always spend where we need to, to make sure that we have the right people building our systems.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. Just want to ask one more question because we're at the end of the call here towards the end. Just on margin balances, I know those rose month on month in June to $42 billion. But the margin balances are still significantly below the $55 billion peak that was reached in, I believe December 2021. So first part of the question, just given the risk on environment we're continuing to see in July, is it fair to think those margin balances have continued to increase month to date? And then the second question, like, do you have any view as to how much of the decline in margin balances from that December \u201821 peak to current levels was driven by the risk-off environment and the shift that we saw over the last year versus higher borrowing rates because we're just trying to get a sense of maybe how much room there is to run in terms of margin balance increases if this risk-on environment persists from here?\nThomas Peterffy: So margin balances are increasing and they have increased since the end of the quarter. And look, as long as the market keeps creeping up, margin balances continue to creep up along with it. What happens with us, that anytime there is a sudden fall in the market, people immediately sell out their leverage positions and then they become very careful and use leverage going forward. So -- well, I have to say to you that as long as the market keeps going up, our margin balances will continue to rise.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. Thanks, Thomas.\nOperator: Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Nancy Stuebe for closing remarks.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you everyone for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again and we will talk to you next quarter-end.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you for your question. Interactive -- introducing brokers have always been an important segment for our business. That is what our sales force focuses on. We have many prospects in the pipeline in various stages of the development. With some, we are still discussing the best way to connect and integrate with us. Others are already doing test trace on our platform and the most advanced ones are already at the stage of getting their customers into the production trading. Not much has changed, other than we continue to focus on the ibroker segment and we are continuously making software development changes that make the integration easier and so that we can offer them more choices for the integration going forward. Go ahead. In 2022, at the end of the year, when we pay our employees the bonuses and adjust their base salaries for the next year, we had to award significant increases in response to the inflation.

            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. Also joining us today are, Milan Galik, our CEO, and Paul Brody, our CFO. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. Our robust operating metrics once again translated into strong financial results this quarter. In fact, but for a substantial addition to reserves for legal contingencies, we would have posted record adjusted pretax income. Our account growth remained strong at 19% while our client equity was up 24%. Margin loans have increased over the course of 2023 as investors are feeling more confident in the markets after down year in 2022. Our net interest income reached a record, as did our total adjusted net revenues, which were over $1 billion this quarter. On the other hand, trading volumes dropped this quarter, and with that dropped our commissions by 10% from the first quarter. Lower commissions prevailed across the board. Option commissions decreased the least, then came futures and stock commissions dropped the most. I do not expect the situation to reverse. Our clients are most heavily weighted in the Magnificent Seven where they luckily have huge unrealized gains that they are not likely to want to realize. As a result, I expect a lot of calls to be written in the coming quarters in these stocks. When the stocks rise further, the calls will be repurchased. And when they fall, they will lapse. In this way, our option commissions will benefit and our stock commissions will continue to suffer. Investors voted to put their money into big tech stocks rather than keeping it at banks at near zero returns. As usual, we do not know how well our advertising worked. Telling everyone about our 4.58% return on immediately available qualified cash may have prevented more and larger withdrawals, but it barely helped to increase customer cash, which grew only by a little more than 2% over the first quarter As I have mentioned before, I still believe inflation is going to stay with us. And while there may be a pause in rate hikes, this is not a short-term state of affairs that will soon result in rate cuts. The debt has increased by $1 trillion since Congress raised the debt limit. Interest on US debt cost over $650 billion over just the past nine months. Annualized, this comes close to $1 trillion a year. This increased spending will drive inflation, which will lead to higher rates, which will in turn increase spending and so on. In terms of our client segments, our strongest ones for account growth have been individuals, proprietary traders and hedge funds. These have also shown the strongest growth in 12-month commissions revenue while individuals, prop traders and financial advisors have been the strongest drivers of net interest income. We are still looking to onboard the first of the two large introducing broker accounts this year, hopefully in the third quarter. It will start slowly and we hope to see it completed within a few months of its start. Our dates are slipping with respect to the second large introducing broker, but we are still hoping to begin onboarding them before year-end. Our developers have been extremely busy with new products and tools, and have a full plate for the remainder of the year. One area we are focused on is delivering specific tools to specific customer types. For financial advisors, we introduced customized indexing, making it easy to build stock portfolios modeled on ETFs that are customizable for tax efficiency and investment goals. Customized indexing clients will own fractional shares of each component stock, so the adviser can adjust weightings, capitalize on gains or losses for tax purposes or exclude specific stocks or sectors, personalizing as their clients need. We also introduced a tax harvesting tool, a streamlined CRM and now offer our RIAs research from ISI Evercore. We do not require minimums. We have no ticket charges and charge no custodial technology, software, platform or reporting fees. For individuals in introducing broker clients, we expanded overnight trading in US stocks and ETFs and now have over 10,000 names available. This has been particularly attractive for our clients in those time zones where investing during regular US trading hours is difficult. For a more sophisticated clients and funds, we introduced our securities lending dashboard, which allows them to access the same expanded securities lending data and key metrics for US equities that historically were only available to banks, broker dealers and large institutional investors. Internationally, we added the Taiwan Stock Exchange, Nasdaq Copenhagen and the Prague Stock Exchange to our platform while fractional share trading will soon be available for Canadian stocks and ETFs. We remain committed to having the most informed clients wherever they are in their investing journey. Our IBKR Campus educational website has the courses, webinars, podcasts and market commentaries to assist our clients in learning more about trading, the economy and financial markets from the most basic educational fundamentals, sophisticated strategies and market commentary. They can learn more about Interactive Brokers trading tools and how to use them. Our Learn and Earn program lets clients who are new to a particular securities product earn commission credits for each bundle of courses they complete. We remain very optimistic about what our business model, international market access, strong and secure balance sheet, multiple features and tools at low prices and high interest paid on cash balances, offers to clients and potential clients around the world. We are extremely disappointed that we did not achieve a new record in the second quarter and we were determined to redouble our efforts and get there in the third. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul? Thank you everyone for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again and we will talk to you next quarter-end."

            "name": "Paul Brody",
            "content": "Thank you, Nancy. Thanks everyone for joining the call. As usual, we'll start with our revenue items in Page 3 of the release. We followed on our strong first quarter performance, recording net revenues of $1 billion in the current quarter. With ongoing customer account and balance sheet growth, we continue to build a strong base for both commission and interest revenues in the future. Commissions were $322 million, level with the year-ago quarter despite industry-wide declines in volumes for futures and especially for equities. Our futures and options volumes came in at -- in near their quarterly highs, while stock share volumes declined from last year's quarter, once again driven by a drop in trading of lower priced stocks. Net interest income was a quarterly record $694 million, reflecting higher interest on margin loans and segregated cash from both increases in benchmark rates and larger segregated cash portfolio. US benchmark rates have moved from an average effective rate of 77 basis points in the second quarter of last year to 499 basis points this quarter. These gains were partially offset by the higher interest we paid on customer credit balances as our long-standing policy is to pass through rate hikes above 50 basis points to our customers on their qualified funds. Other fees and services generated $47 million, with the biggest contributors being market data fees of $18 million, risk exposure fee revenue of $10 million and options exchange liquidity payments of $7 million. The increase in risk exposure fees from the prior year quarter was driven by more risk-on positioning of customers, which led to a $4 million rise in these fees. Other income was a loss of $63 million and includes gains and losses on our investment, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings and without these excluded items, other income was a $1 million gain for the quarter. Turning to expenses, execution clearing and distribution costs rose 21% versus last year, led by higher volumes in options, which carry higher fees, the non-recurrence of last year's $3 million OCC clearing fee rebate and a $1 million increase in market data fees, as well as lower liquidity rebates. We find it useful to measure what we call gross transactional profit, which is commissions less execution and clearing costs directly related to trading, which excludes primarily market data distribution fees. As a percent of commission revenues, execution and clearing costs, which are driven by a combination of trading volume, exchange rebates and changing fee schedules, were at 22% this quarter for a gross transactional profit margin of 78%. Market data expense, a pass-through item, is included in execution clearing and distribution fees line item, while the corresponding market data revenue is reported in other fees and services rather than in commission. For this purpose, in the second quarter, we exclude $15 million in market data expense. Compensation and benefits expense rose 21% over the prior year quarter on a combination of staffing increases and inflation. While up in dollar terms for the quarter, comp and benefits expense remained at 13% of our adjusted net revenues versus 16% last year and somewhat below its historical level. Our headcount at quarter-end was 2,908. G&A expenses roughly doubled versus last year's second quarter, largely attributable to a substantial increase in reserves related to the previously disclosed regulatory investigation into the use of unapproved electronic messaging and the firm's record keeping requirements. Without that increase, G&A expenses would be down slightly year-on-year. Our adjusted pretax margin was 67%, up from 63% in the year-ago quarter. While higher interest rates benefit us, automation remains our key means of maintaining consistently high margin. Income tax expense of $51 million reflects the sum of the public company's $30 million and the operating company's $21 million. Moving to our balance sheet on Page 5 of our release. Our total assets were $121 billion at the end of the quarter, with growth over last year driven primarily by increases in our segregated cash and securities. We maintain a balance sheet aimed at supporting our growing business and providing ample financial resources during volatile markets with maximum flexibility and short-term liquidity. We have no long-term debt. The duration of our investment portfolio as of June 30th was 40 days. Turning to our operating data on pages 6 and 7. Our contract volumes for all customers were strong, reaching their fourth highest quarterly level in options, up 9% over the year-ago quarter. Futures contract and stock share volumes were down 3% and 28% respectively. Options and futures volumes were generally in line with industry volume. And in stocks, the drop-off was largely attributable to investors moving to higher quality stocks as trading in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks was impacted most. On Page 7, you can see that our account growth remains robust with over 95,000 net account adds in the quarter and total accounts of 2.3 million, up 19% over the prior year. Total customer DARTs were 1.9 million trades per day, down 14% from the stronger prior year quarter. Our cleared IBKR Pro customers paid an average of $3.11 commission per cleared commissionable order, up 14% from last year as our client's volume mix included higher per order contributions from nearly all product categories, particularly from options and futures. Page 8 presents our net interest margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income nearly doubled to $694 million on the year-ago quarter, reflecting stronger earnings on segregated cash and margin loans, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balance. After a series of seven target rate increases in 2022, the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by 25 basis points three times this year. And many other central banks also raised this quarter. This group includes the UK, Canada, Australia, and Hong Kong, as well as the Eurozone and Switzerland. Net interest on segregated cash was $700 million, primarily due to federal reserve rate hikes, but also to our managing short duration on invested funds, which has allowed us to more closely match asset and liability maturities and to pick up benchmark rate increases quickly. At June 30, our US portfolio duration was 40 days, so the investments have rolled over into new higher rates with a fairly short lag time. A 21% increase over the year-ago quarter in average segregated cash and securities balances also drove interest income higher. Margin loan interest rose to $547 million, up significantly from $197 million last year despite average margin loan balances declining 11% from last year's second quarter. Higher rates in the US and internationally have driven higher margin interest income. Securities lending net interest was $79 million, down from the year-ago quarter due to a dynamic we have noted previously. While securities lending opportunities maintained a relatively strong pace, it's also the case that as benchmark rates rise, a greater portion of the revenue generated by securities lending, for which we receive cash collateral that we invest as segregated funds is reflected as interest on segregated cash. We estimate this impact to be about $40 million for the quarter versus last year. In other words, without this shift in reporting line items, net interest from securities lending would be $119 million, up 3% from the year-ago quarter. Interest on customer credit balances or the interest we pay our customers grew as higher rates in many currencies led to our paying interest on qualifying balances as we pass through rate increases. We paid $774 million to our customers on their balances in the second quarter. Fully rate sensitive balances were roughly unchanged at about $20 billion. We consider our policy offering clients a full pass-through of all rate hikes after the first 50 basis points on their qualified cash, a significant component in our success and one that continues to set us apart. We believe this leads to clients choosing to keep their cash with us, especially active clients who do not want to use sweep programs that prevent them from immediately accessing their cash to invest. Now for our estimates of the impact of increases in rates, given market expectations of possibly one or more rate hikes to come, we estimate the effect of increases in the Fed funds rate to produce an additional annual net interest income of approximately $49 million for each 25 basis points increase in the benchmark. Note that our starting point for these estimates is June 30, with the Fed funds effective rate at 5.08% and also based on balances at that date. About 25% of our customer cash balances is not in US dollars. So estimates of US rate change in fact exclude these currencies. We estimate increases in all the relevant non-USD benchmarks rate to produce additional annual net interest income of $26 million for each 25 basis point increase in the benchmarks. In conclusion, the company performed well in the second quarter in a complex and uncertain environment, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base and deliver on our core services to customers, all at a low cost and while offering meaningful cash interest, as we manage the business effectively with strong controls over risk and operating expense. And with that, we'll turn it over to moderator and we will take questions. Well, I think it's not that variable when you take out our non-GAAP adjustments, right, which is primarily the currency impact and partially from mark to market on US government securities. And by the way, that's not -- that's smaller than it used to be given that our duration is so short. So we report to you which items we've taken out. And if you take those out, you probably get a reasonable baseline. But other income is also some miscellaneous investments and things that are not very predictable, but after those large items, the whole category is not very large. I don't think we could say that precisely. You're talking about when we liquidated some treasuries, reinvested them in shorter term Yeah, I mean, we recognized the liquidated loss and obviously reinvested at short-term current treasury rates and, if you look at the yield curve, you know what those are. So, yes, we're making it back for sure. Yes, it's still in there and it's a very minor contributor to the total. Right. So on the comp and you're right to ask this question. So it's not specifically a one-off, but there is some expense in there for -- we have to expense accrued vacation days of staff that have not yet been taken. So each quarter, we measure the accruals, which are at a fairly consistent rate versus days taken and they tend to be smaller in the second quarter and then people tend to take vacation in the third quarter. And each quarter we have to recognize an expense, so the difference between those two. It happened to be that in the second quarter, the difference was larger than usual. And so there is -- probably the impact is 2% or 3% on that 21% that came from that, we would expect it to return maybe even in the third quarter, depends on when people take a vacation. And then, of course, inflation figures into all of that and we had a headcount increase. So that gets us the most of the rest."

            "name": "Thomas Peterffy",
            "content": "Are you asking about marketing, expenses or the reserves? Yeah, the marketing expense, yes, we're definitely going to stick with our marketing program and we will increase marketing spend gradually quarter after quarter after quarter, we will spend more and more money marketing as we find out marketing outlets that we believe to be -- although we cannot precisely measure it, but we believe to be a positive impact. Well, I think that what is coming down the pike is more technology driven order flow. And that as more AI systems get behind money management, I think that as a result of that trading activity will pick up. There will be more and more small orders, there will be more and more fractional shareholders, there will be more and more registered investment advisers who will hire technology driven systems to drive their investment choices. And so that's what I see in the future. Yeah. So look, the introducing broker client is always the least profitable client. The actual client is always the most profitable client and the prop traders are our sweet spot. So yes, to the extent that our number of accounts will jump in number, the profitability will not similarly increase. Profitability comes mostly from our most sophisticated professional client base, which is by the way also -- is increasing quite well. Well, I'll put some numbers around it. Let me put it this way. So our average account yields about $1,200 of revenues per year. The average introducing broker account, GI, I'm guessing here -- for every introducing broker account, I would expect them to be around $300 to $400 a year. And the -- you know, you're asking to put numbers around it. I do not have these numbers in front of me, unfortunately. So I really -- I'm embarrassed I can't tell you. Well, it all has to do with -- when the Fed is scheduled to move. So we do not want to speculate on what the Fed is going to do. So we like to -- we prefer to invest before the Fed date or if the Fed like in this case said that they are going to raise a quarter we believe them that they are going to raise a quarter and given that the market believes 98% that they are going to raise quarter, we don't mind to go over that date, but not the subsequent date. So we are still before we are investing to prior -- to our investment will mature before the September Fed meeting. So margin balances are increasing and they have increased since the end of the quarter. And look, as long as the market keeps creeping up, margin balances continue to creep up along with it. What happens with us, that anytime there is a sudden fall in the market, people immediately sell out their leverage positions and then they become very careful and use leverage going forward. So -- well, I have to say to you that as long as the market keeps going up, our margin balances will continue to rise."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Interactive Brokers Group First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Nancy Stuebe, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNancy Stuebe : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. Also joining us today are Milan Galik, our CEO, and Paul Brody, our CFO. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. This quarter at IBKR had something for everybody. Account growth was strong; DARTs rose despite uncertain markets, and commission revenue was the second highest in our history. Meanwhile, our net interest income reached a record, and our reported pretax margin reached 72%. We achieved this using our simple strategy, one that seems to be unique in our industry today: - We run a conservative balance sheet, with ample equity, and an extremely short portfolio duration. That means we have over $12 billion in equity, and our portfolio duration is a matter of 3 to 4 weeks, not months, not years. This balance sheet supports a global business where we charge the lowest prices on commissions, and we pay the highest rates on uninvested client cash. We pay these rates on cash that you can use right now: you don\u2019t have to sweep it out, and then wait if you need it back. With us, our clients\u2019 cash can do two things - be available and earn interest - at the same time. Because of this, we do not and have not seen clients taking cash out of their Interactive Brokers accounts and moving it elsewhere; we do see them using their cash to invest in the markets. Because of our high rates on qualified client cash, we are paying more than most, if not all, banks. We also have active customers, who want instant access to the markets. We simply do not see cash in client accounts moving elsewhere on a net basis. More and more investors are looking to the markets to earn a return that will allow them to build their wealth beyond the level of inflation, and this has been true for us around the world. I still believe inflation is going to stay with us, and \u2013 as it has done - will likely remain above 4%. US government debt is now about $31 trillion, 120% of GDP. This is forecast to grow by $2 trillion a year, thanks to rising interest costs that end up adding somewhat to the inflation sparked by extraordinary US government spending during COVID. Now, even though they contribute to inflation, we need higher rates to fight it. This is not a short-term state of affairs that will soon result in rate cuts. We are still seeing retail engagement. 12-month commissions for the individual client segment, as well as for the hedge fund and proprietary client segments, rose this quarter versus last year. Hedge fund 12-month commissions alone grew 81%. Product-wise, while stock share volumes did not keep pace with a very active quarter last year, futures and options contract volumes continue to rise, with both reaching monthly volume records here in March. More activity in futures and options contributed to our higher cleared commissions per DART of $3.16, up over 20%, as these products carry higher commissions. As a note, higher futures commissions include very high exchange and regulatory fees, which in part explain our higher execution and clearing direct expense. As clients continue to want to engage with the options markets, we have made it even more appealing by introducing a new routing venue for our clients, IBOPT, where our customers can give us an order pegged to the midpoint, or to the bid and offer, and give us their parameters of how much above the bid or below the offer they\u2019re willing to pay, and their options order floats as the bid and offer move. If we get a counter order, it gets executed. This is a unique product in the space, one that works especially well with very active, liquid options, and allows our customers to act like market makers. This is the heart of what we do \u2013 automate for client success. It is the complicated part of what we do. What we see in the future, is more of what we already deliver. Our net new accounts are growing just over 20%, and we are still looking to onboard the first of the two large introducing broker accounts this quarter. It will start slowly and we hope to see it completed by the end of the year. We also remain on track to start onboarding the second large i-broker account sometime in the third quarter. We have also focused on appealing to financial advisors with several features. We are soon introducing customized indexing, to make it easy for them to build stock portfolios modeled on ETFs, but customizable for tax efficiency and investment goals. Unlike a one-size-fits-all ETF, with customized indexing clients will own fractional shares of each component stock, so an advisor can adjust weightings, capitalize on gains or losses for tax purposes, or exclude specific stocks or sectors, personalizing as their clients need. We do not require minimums, we have no ticket charges, and charge no custodial, technology, software, platform or reporting fees. We also save financial advisors money on their mutual fund investments. As just one example, at other firms if an advisor chooses an allocation to a particular mutual fund for 100 customers, that means 100 separately-charged ticket fees. At IBKR, you only pay one commission - $14.95 \u2013 and no ticket fees, no matter how many customers you put into a fund, even for 1,000 customers. And finally, we now offer third party research from global, independent research firm ISI Evercore to our financial advisor clients in the US and several other countries. I have great confidence in Interactive Brokers\u2019 capabilities and strengths, and in the secular trends that are taking place around the world \u2013 more people wanting to invest in securities markets, more investors globally looking to gain exposure to different countries, particularly the US; rising income levels in developing countries; and the acceptance, worldwide, that investing in the markets is the way to build wealth. I have less confidence in the responses seen so far to inflation, bank sector troubles, and the mounting cost of US debt service. Interest expense in 2023 on US debt is expected to rise 35% this year, to $640 billion, and to \u00be of a trillion dollars next year. This all gets added to our growing deficit. This means investors around the world look increasingly to the markets to stay ahead of inflation and uncertainty. It has grown clear to more and more people that holding onto cash, when it is earning low or no interest, is a losing proposition. We let all investors know that Interactive Brokers pays its clients 4.33% on their cash balances, without having to sweep. We continuously add relevant content to our IBKR Campus educational website, to make it simple to use and easier for clients to find topics of interest to better understand the world of investing. We will serve our customers, in over 200 countries and territories, and educate them about their options \u2013 both their opportunities and the security. We continue to add accounts, and are excited about where our position \u2013 as a leader in international access, with a strong and safe balance sheet, offering a good deal to people as well as comprehensive educational tools for all \u2013 will take us. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul?\nPaul Brody: Thank you, Nancy. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call. As usual, we\u2019re going to review the first quarter operating results, and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Starting with our Revenue items on page 3 of the release, we recorded another strong quarter, with record net revenues that exceeded $1 billion in a quarter for the first time. With ongoing customer account and balance sheet growth, we continue to expand our potential for both commission and interest revenues in the future. Commissions were strong, reaching $357 million despite mixed equity markets worldwide. Futures and options volumes reached record levels, while stock share volumes declined from last year\u2019s quarter, once again driven by a drop in trading of lower-priced stocks. Net interest income of $637 million reflected higher interest from margin loans and segregated cash, owing to increases in benchmark rates and a larger segregated cash portfolio. US benchmark rates have moved from an average effective rate of 12 basis points in the first quarter of last year to 451 basis points this quarter. These gains were partially offset by the higher interest we paid on customer credit balances, as our longstanding policy is to pass through rate hikes above 50 basis points to our customers on their qualified funds. Other fees and services generated $43 million, with the biggest contributors being market data fees of $18 million, options exchange liquidity payments of $8 million, and risk exposure fee revenue of $6 million. The drop from the prior year quarter was driven primarily by the risk-off positioning of customers, which led to a $9 million reduction in risk exposure fees. Other income of $19 million includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings, and without these excluded items, other income was a $22 million loss for the quarter as we removed realized and unrealized gains on our US Treasury portfolio. Turning to expenses, Execution, Clearing & Distribution costs rose 34% versus last year, led by higher volumes in options and futures, which carry higher fees, lower liquidity rebates, and higher regulatory transaction fees. We find it useful to measure what we call Gross Transactional Profit, which is commissions less the pure volume-driven Execution & Clearing costs. As a percent of commission revenues, Execution & Clearing costs, which are driven by a combination of trading volume, exchange rebates and changing fee schedules, were 21% this quarter, in other words, a Gross Transactional Profit of 79%. Market Data expense, a pass-through item, is included in \u201cExecution, Clearing & Distribution Fees\u201d, while the corresponding Market Data revenue is reported in \u201cOther fees and services\u201d rather than in Commissions. For this purpose, in the first quarter we exclude $18 million in primarily Market Data expense. Compensation & Benefits expense rose $17 million, or 15%, over the prior year, driven by hiring in Europe and APAC and, in part, by inflation. While up in dollar terms for the quarter, Compensation & Benefits expense fell to 13% of our adjusted Net Revenues, versus 16% last year and somewhat below its historical level. Our headcount at quarter-end was 2,872. G&A expenses were down 5% versus last year\u2019s first quarter, primarily on lower advertising and legal expenses. Our adjusted pretax margin was a record 71%. While higher interest rates benefit us, automation remains our key means of maintaining consistently high margins, as well as continued expense control while we hire talented people and invest in the future of our business. Income tax expense of $61 million reflects the sum of the public company\u2019s $31 million and the operating companies\u2019 $30 million. Moving to the balance sheet on page 5 of our release, our total assets were $119 billion at the end of the quarter, with growth over the last year driven by increases in our segregated cash and securities. We maintain a balance sheet aimed at supporting our growing business and providing ample financial resources during volatile markets, with maximum flexibility and short-term liquidity. We have no long-term debt. The duration of our investment portfolio as of March 31st was 24 days. Turning to our operating data, on pages 6 and 7 of the release, our contract volumes for all customers were strong, reaching their highest quarterly level in both options and futures, up 2% and 4%, respectively, over the year-ago quarter. Stock share volume was down 22% versus last year\u2019s first quarter, and the drop off was largely attributable to investors moving to higher quality stocks, as trading in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks was impacted most. On page 7, you can see that our account growth remains robust, with over 100,000 net account adds in the quarter, and total accounts at 2.2 million, up 21% over the prior year. Total Customer DARTs were 2.1 million trades per day, down 19% from the stronger prior-year quarter. Our Cleared IBKR Pro Customers paid an average of $3.16 Commission per Cleared Commissionable Order, up 23% from last year as our clients\u2019 volume mix included higher per order contributions from all product categories, and particularly from stocks and options. Page 8 presents our Net Interest Margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income more than doubled to $637 million on the year-ago quarter, reflecting stronger earnings on segregated cash and margin loans, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. After a series of seven target rate increases in 2022, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates twice this quarter, by 25 basis points each in February and March. Many other central banks also raised rates this quarter. This group includes the UK, Canada, Australia and Hong Kong, as well as the Eurozone and Switzerland. Net interest on segregated cash was $603 million, primarily due to Federal Reserve rate hikes but also to our managing to short duration on invested funds, which has allowed us to more closely match asset and liability maturities and to pick up benchmark rate increases quickly. At March 31st, our US portfolio duration was 24 days, so the investments roll over into new, higher, rates with a fairly short lag time. A 38% increase over the year-ago quarter in average segregated cash and securities balances also drove interest income higher. Margin loan interest rose to $477 million, up significantly from $149 million last year, despite average margin loan balances declining 17% from last year\u2019s first quarter. Higher rates, in the US and internationally, have driven higher margin interest income. Securities lending net interest was $88 million, down 20% from the year-ago quarter. It\u2019s worth noting that, while securities lending opportunities maintained a relatively strong pace, it is also the case that as benchmark rates rise, a greater portion of the revenue generated by lending securities is reflected in interest on Segregated Cash, because the cash collateral received is invested as segregated funds. We estimate this impact to be about $41 million for the quarter vs last year. In other words, without this shift in reporting line items, net interest from securities lending would be $129 million, up 18% from the year-ago quarter. Interest on Customer Credit Balances, or the interest we pay our customers, grew as higher rates in many currencies led to our paying interest on qualifying balances as we pass through rate increases. We paid $653 million to our customers on these balances in the first quarter. Fully rate sensitive balances were roughly unchanged at about $20 billion. We consider our policy offering clients a full pass-through of all rate hikes after the first 50 basis points on their qualified cash a significant component in our success, and one that sets us apart. We believe this leads to clients choosing to keep their cash with us, especially active clients who do not want to use sweep programs that prevent them from immediately accessing their cash to invest. As Thomas mentioned, on balance we do not see clients moving their cash away from us. Now, for our estimates of the impact of increases in rates \u2013 Given market expectations of possibly one or more rate hikes to come, we estimate the effects of increases in the Fed Funds rate to produce an additional annual net interest income of approximately $50 million for each 25 basis increase in the benchmark. Note that our starting point for these estimates is March 31, with the Fed Funds effective rate at 4.83%, and based on balances at that date. About 26% of our customer cash balances is not in US dollars, so estimates of US rate change effects exclude those currencies. We estimate a 25 basis point increase in all the relevant non-USD benchmark rates would produce additional annual net interest income of $26 million, and rising to about $100 million at a 100 basis point rate increase. In conclusion, the company generated a strong performance in the first quarter in a complex and volatile environment, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base and deliver our core services to customers, all at low cost and while offering meaningful cash interest, as we manage the business effectively with strong risk and expense controls. And with that, we will now open up the line for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Richard Repetto from Piper Sandler.\nRichard Repetto: I guess, first question is sort of an accounting question. Just trying to understand the $40 million mark that I think you said, Paul, that you removed realized and unrealized gains. Is this a one time thing? I'm just trying to understand whether I am missing something\u2013 is this a one-time thing in the quarter? Or has this been done in other quarters as well?\nPaul Brody: Sure. So, this quarter's effect is a onetime effect. Let me explain it this way. As you know, we have considered that our investment in the treasury portfolio to have temporary mark-to-market fluctuations, which are reflected in our financial statements\u2013 both the income statement and the balance sheet. By the end of the year, the accumulated losses on our treasury portfolio because of market movement, were about $39 million. That was all in the income statement and the balance sheet. For non-GAAP reporting, which is what we call non-core to our operating results in the release\u2013 it\u2019s in the earnings release every quarter, we pull out those mark-to-market effects. So cumulatively, by the end of the year, we had a $39 million accumulated loss that we had pulled out for the purposes of the non-core reporting. We have pulled out the losses and that raised the non-core reporting. During the first quarter, we liquidated some securities rather than holding them to maturity. And by liquidating them, it erases the previous accumulated loss. In effect, putting it back in when it was realized upon the sale of those securities. So those were sold. That also played a role in reducing our duration on the remaining portfolio down to 24 days, extremely short. And we wouldn't expect much mark-to-market impact at all going forward because it is unlikely to be much on a very short duration portfolio.\nRichard Repetto: Okay. Just one quick follow-up on that point, Paul. So why weren't these securities held to maturity then?\nPaul Brody: We make investment decisions from time to time based on market conditions. We felt that it made sense to sell a security and reinvest in currently higher rates. And looking forward, it also reduced fluctuation in our mark-to-market results. Had we held it to maturity, it would have resulted in approaching par value each quarter until what would have been the end of this year\u2013 they were not very long term. At the end of the year, they would have made it all the way back to par value, and we would have recaptured the exact thing that we declared this quarter all at once, we would have done it over four quarters toward maturity.\nThomas Peterffy: It also allowed us to reduce our taxes a little bit last year.\nRichard Repetto: Understood. And just one quick question away from that topic. Thomas, just on the introducing brokers that you expected to start this quarter. Could you give us an update? You said it's going to go gradually\u2013 is it more of the same, just dealing with large financial institutions that it's difficult to deal with? Any other detail on the progress there?\nThomas Peterffy: Milan, would you like to answer that?\nMilan Galik: Sure. So, the first of the two i-brokers already started onboarding its employees. The employees are basically testing the quality of the integration, going through all the functionality. The aim currently is for them to onboard the entire set of their clients and move them from their existing vendor broker in the summer. So, the first i-broker should be fully onboarded in the summer. There could be some delay. So maybe, latest Q3. The second of the two i-brokers is moving a little bit slower. That relationship is bigger. It involves more of their entities. They have not yet started onboarding. They will most likely start in Q3.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Daniel Fannon from Jefferies.\nDaniel Fannon: I was hoping you could expand upon the hedge fund segment. I know you've been taking share and growing there. But maybe I think you said commissions were up 80% year-over-year. But if there's other stats that you could provide to help us think about the success you're having and the contribution of that segment?\nThomas Peterffy: So, what other stats do you have in mind?\nDaniel Fannon: Well, I guess, in terms of number of customers, the customer count and the growth and then I think you have some goals, I think you've said previously in terms of what you want to get through over time.\nThomas Peterffy: Yes. So, we are #6 as far as number of hedge funds. Ahead of us was Credit Suisse that is not going to be there this quarter. So, we'll be #5. And then ahead of us is also Bank of America\u2013 barely ahead of us by number of hedge funds. So, we believe we will be #4 or #5 the next time Preqin issues their stats on prime brokers for hedge funds. And it will probably be in the fall.\nDaniel Fannon: Okay. And in terms of the size of where you're having the most success, what's the average size? And I assume it's mostly in the U.S., but is it also outside the U.S.?\nThomas Peterffy: The average size is around, I think, $8 million. So, they are the smaller funds. Many of them\u2013 I mean, quite a few of them lose money and quite a few of them make money. So, some of them drop out and some of them become large, and we hope that they will stay with us. We also have large hedge funds, but we are probably their second or third or sometimes fourth prime broker. So, they come to us because, a) our executions, they like our executions; b) they like the fact that they can see our short inventory and the rates at which they can borrow various equity issues from us. And when they compare that to their primary hedge fund, they either use our rates to bid them up into giving them a better rate or they actually ask us to borrow the shares from.\nDaniel Fannon: Understood. And then can you confirm just the other income, excluding the movements in the one-timers that you talked about with the portfolio and treasuries, what that would be on a kind of a run rate basis going forward?\nThomas Peterffy: Paul?\nPaul Brody: Well, other income includes investments and various other things. So, it's a little difficult to say that it has a run rate. Investments will rise and fall over time. And it's difficult to pin that down.\nDaniel Fannon: But I guess, just if I look historically, that there was no one-time as we look at the $19 million in the fourth quarter or the single digits for most of the three quarters before, that's how we should think about it going forward? Those are the clean numbers?\nPaul Brody: Yes. Let's remember that our currency diversification strategy that we call the GLOBAL, the result of currencies versus dollar going up and down are a component of other income. Sometimes it's a large component. This quarter, it was practically nothing. So, that's at least for you because we disclose the composition of our GLOBAL, that's for you a predictable number because you can imply exchange rates and make an estimate.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: So, the Fed provided a nice tailwind for IBKR on the way up. If we start seeing cuts over the next year, is there any reason that the asset sensitivity on the way down would look any different than on the way up, just given the short duration of your assets and also the large equity position that partially fund your balance sheet?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, on the way down, we would decrease by the same amount we increased by, except for the fact that we are getting in more and more accounts. So, to the extent, we'll have more clients to do more trades and to keep with us more cash, it is going to be moderated. But if we went back to zero interest rates, of course, our interest income would be very similar to what it was a year ago. But I do not believe that we will get back to zero.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Benjamin Budish from Barclays.\nBenjamin Budish: I wanted to circle back on the introducing broker clients that are going to be onboarding later this year. I think there's a sort of a general understanding that as retail clients that are new to the platform join, they sort of become more productive over time. But these are generally existing clients from a previous broker. What's your sort of expectation in terms of the activity from these customers? Do you think that you could see sort of a step up over time as they become more familiar with perhaps new options that are offered with IBKR on the back end? And as part of that, how should we think about the cash balances coming over? Should we assume that it's a lot of fully rate-sensitive cash. Is that a fair assumption?\nThomas Peterffy: So, it is generally true that a new account starts at $3 and it grows to $6 in the first year and then goes to $9 after 2 or 3 years. So, I do not expect these customers to be any different from that.\nBenjamin Budish: Okay. That's helpful. And then just thinking about sort of the strength in the quarter, particularly in March with futures and options activity. To what degree do you think that's sustainable? Was a lot of that just sort of in response to the volatility created by the banking crisis? Or do you think there's sort of a possibility for this sort of sustained engagement from retail in options and futures to kind of continue over the next several months or taking part of longer term?\nThomas Peterffy: Well to tell you frankly, for the past 10 days or so, our commissions are certainly lower than they were in the preceding 10 days. So, the banking crisis certainly contributed to some stronger activity that seems to have subsided now. But generally, when markets go down, the activity increases and when they stop going down and start to slowly climb up the activity decreases. So that's what we are seeing in the commission income side.\nMilan Galik: And there is an additional component here. The options trading is getting generally more and more popular and the type of clientele that we attract looks towards the option offering that we have as part of our platform. So the expectation is that the options trading and derivatives trading in general is going to be growing over time, even as volatilities drop in the market.\nOperator: And our next question is Kyle Voigt from KBW.\nKyle Voigt: Thomas, you started the call in the prepared remarks, highlighting the yields you're paying on idle cash balances. And we've also been noticing that you're marketing this recently and comparing your yield to that of other brokers. I guess, have you seen evidence that clients are consolidating more cash or more assets at IBKR from other brokers or other accounts because of that yield differential and because of some of the marketing push that you've been making recently?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, unfortunately, I did not. So, the incoming moneys are about the same as they were a month ago or two months or three months ago. It's very steady\u2014we haven't seen any pickup and we also haven't seen any drawdowns.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. And I just wanted to follow up on the prior question. I know you've been quite positive on the growth trajectory for options, broadly speaking, and believe that growth is sustainable over the medium term. But I was wondering if you could comment on some of the growth in this SPX zero-day-to-expiry option trading. We've seen grow rapidly over the past few quarters. I understand that your customers are one of the larger users of the zero-day products. Just wondering if you could give us any detail on which client segments you're seeing utilize those products within IB? And then also just give us your thoughts broadly on this zero-day options trend and whether you see the volume growth in those products as sustainable as we look out over the next few years as well?\nThomas Peterffy: So, it is certainly sustainable because it's less expensive for people to take a position in one-day options, one day ahead of news, right? Previously, they had to take a position that would have several days to run even though they would take the position a day ahead of the news. So, it is cheaper for them to use the one-day option. Also, when people want to take a position in a larger portfolio, it's easier for them to accumulate on one-day, say Standard and Poor\u2019s options and trade the portfolio on a market on close order. And that way, it's a lot cheaper for them to buy or sell that portfolio.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. And I just have one follow-up. One last question. It's just regarding the balance sheet of the company. You now have, I think, close to $9 billion of capital in excess of your regulatory requirements. And that excess capital figure has grown significantly over the past few years. I know you've previously stated you wanted that excess capital to help support the prime brokerage operations and to help customers kind of feel safe custodying assets at IB. But I guess is there some level of excess capital where you'd feel as an adequate level and therefore, not needing to continue to build that as rapidly as it has over the past few years? And just updated thoughts there would be great.\nThomas Peterffy: Very strange that you should ask that question at the time that many of our peers appear to have insufficient amounts of capital. So no, we are very proud to have as much capital as we do, and we hope to keep growing it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have one more question. Our next question comes from Chris Allen from Citi.\nChris Allen: Just wanted to touch on\u2013 you noted that advertising spending was down year-over-year, helping drive G&A lower. Can you just give us an update on the marketing strategy here. I know in the past, you talked about being a targeted marketing strategy. How has that evolved recently? And is the pullback in advertising just a result of the environment or just a lower opportunity set?\nThomas Peterffy: So, you will see that \u2013 maybe you notice our heads cropping up all over the place. We're trying to advertise our 4.33% interest that we pay on instantly available cash. We roughly have doubled our advertising spending a month ago. So, you will see a much larger advertising spend in the next quarter.\nChris Allen: Understood. And then just one more quick one. On headcount growth, the pace of growth has been moderating in recent quarters. Is that just because you're reaching scale in certain areas, whether it's from a country or regional perspective or just the near-term opportunity so just you don't need to grow as fast as you have in the past?\nThomas Peterffy: I think this is a CEO question.\nMilan Galik: So, we are obviously paying a lot of attention to our expenses. The human capital cost is significant. What we have seen is \u2013 if I compare our numbers to the one-year-ago quarter, the customer service personnel has decreased by 3%; our compliance team has increased by, let's say, 10%; and our information technology personnel, which is programmers, technicians, system administrators and similar, that number went up by 16%. So, these numbers are not bad. The fact that we are increasing the size of our information technology team just signifies our commitment to being a leader in financial services technology tools for our investors. So, you can expect us to grow the team as we have increasing amount of work. The customer service, I think that team is at a good level. We are closely paying attention to the wait times of our customers calling us\u2013 how long they have to stay in the phone queue, and that number is very low single-digit minutes. We like that. So, the size of the team seemed to be appropriate to the level of business that we have and the number of accounts that we have. One of the reasons that we do not have to grow that team has to do with the fact that our platform is over time becoming more user-friendly, and we have done a very good job in providing self-service customer service\u2013 to various FAQs and chatbots and that type of technology. As far as the compliance staff, we had to increase it because there is a lot of surveillance that we have to do on both cashiering transactions that our customers perform as well as trading activity. The operators that we have, there is a few hundred of them, pay attention to the various alerts that our systems generate and then they check whether those alerts signify a problem or if they're just false positives. We are putting a significant amount of energy into making those alerts more targeted, decreasing the number of false positives as well as making it easier for the operators to service those alerts. So, I would like the size of that team\u2013 the growth of that team to slow down as well, and I believe we will achieve that. So, these numbers, I think, are good. The team is at the right size. Obviously, if it was smaller, our profit margin would be greater, and that is what we would like to deliver to our investors.\nChris Allen: Great color. Just one quick follow-up. On the IT personnel side, has the cost of talent moderated at all as there's been more pressure in the tech sector?\nMilan Galik: So very lately, it has become easier to hire good technologists. So obviously, there have been layoffs. We all can read about them in the news. So that made it easier. We now don't have to kill ourselves in making oversized offers, including the sign-up bonuses. So yes, it became easier. And we are taking advantage of that. Some of the talent that is available is very good, and we would obviously like to get a hold of that. So, we can do that.\nOperator: I am showing no further questions. I would like to turn it back to Nancy Stuebe for closing remarks.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will talk to you next quarter end.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Nancy Stuebe",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Once again, Thomas is on the call, but asked me to present his comments on the business. Also joining us today are Milan Galik, our CEO, and Paul Brody, our CFO. After prepared remarks, we will have a Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. This quarter at IBKR had something for everybody. Account growth was strong; DARTs rose despite uncertain markets, and commission revenue was the second highest in our history. Meanwhile, our net interest income reached a record, and our reported pretax margin reached 72%. We achieved this using our simple strategy, one that seems to be unique in our industry today: - We run a conservative balance sheet, with ample equity, and an extremely short portfolio duration. That means we have over $12 billion in equity, and our portfolio duration is a matter of 3 to 4 weeks, not months, not years. This balance sheet supports a global business where we charge the lowest prices on commissions, and we pay the highest rates on uninvested client cash. We pay these rates on cash that you can use right now: you don't have to sweep it out, and then wait if you need it back. With us, our clients' cash can do two things - be available and earn interest - at the same time. Because of this, we do not and have not seen clients taking cash out of their Interactive Brokers accounts and moving it elsewhere; we do see them using their cash to invest in the markets. Because of our high rates on qualified client cash, we are paying more than most, if not all, banks. We also have active customers, who want instant access to the markets. We simply do not see cash in client accounts moving elsewhere on a net basis. More and more investors are looking to the markets to earn a return that will allow them to build their wealth beyond the level of inflation, and this has been true for us around the world. I still believe inflation is going to stay with us, and \u2013 as it has done - will likely remain above 4%. US government debt is now about $31 trillion, 120% of GDP. This is forecast to grow by $2 trillion a year, thanks to rising interest costs that end up adding somewhat to the inflation sparked by extraordinary US government spending during COVID. Now, even though they contribute to inflation, we need higher rates to fight it. This is not a short-term state of affairs that will soon result in rate cuts. We are still seeing retail engagement. 12-month commissions for the individual client segment, as well as for the hedge fund and proprietary client segments, rose this quarter versus last year. Hedge fund 12-month commissions alone grew 81%. Product-wise, while stock share volumes did not keep pace with a very active quarter last year, futures and options contract volumes continue to rise, with both reaching monthly volume records here in March. More activity in futures and options contributed to our higher cleared commissions per DART of $3.16, up over 20%, as these products carry higher commissions. As a note, higher futures commissions include very high exchange and regulatory fees, which in part explain our higher execution and clearing direct expense. As clients continue to want to engage with the options markets, we have made it even more appealing by introducing a new routing venue for our clients, IBOPT, where our customers can give us an order pegged to the midpoint, or to the bid and offer, and give us their parameters of how much above the bid or below the offer they're willing to pay, and their options order floats as the bid and offer move. If we get a counter order, it gets executed. This is a unique product in the space, one that works especially well with very active, liquid options, and allows our customers to act like market makers. This is the heart of what we do \u2013 automate for client success. It is the complicated part of what we do. What we see in the future, is more of what we already deliver. Our net new accounts are growing just over 20%, and we are still looking to onboard the first of the two large introducing broker accounts this quarter. It will start slowly and we hope to see it completed by the end of the year. We also remain on track to start onboarding the second large i-broker account sometime in the third quarter. We have also focused on appealing to financial advisors with several features. We are soon introducing customized indexing, to make it easy for them to build stock portfolios modeled on ETFs, but customizable for tax efficiency and investment goals. Unlike a one-size-fits-all ETF, with customized indexing clients will own fractional shares of each component stock, so an advisor can adjust weightings, capitalize on gains or losses for tax purposes, or exclude specific stocks or sectors, personalizing as their clients need. We do not require minimums, we have no ticket charges, and charge no custodial, technology, software, platform or reporting fees. We also save financial advisors money on their mutual fund investments. As just one example, at other firms if an advisor chooses an allocation to a particular mutual fund for 100 customers, that means 100 separately-charged ticket fees. At IBKR, you only pay one commission - $14.95 \u2013 and no ticket fees, no matter how many customers you put into a fund, even for 1,000 customers. And finally, we now offer third party research from global, independent research firm ISI Evercore to our financial advisor clients in the US and several other countries. I have great confidence in Interactive Brokers' capabilities and strengths, and in the secular trends that are taking place around the world \u2013 more people wanting to invest in securities markets, more investors globally looking to gain exposure to different countries, particularly the US; rising income levels in developing countries; and the acceptance, worldwide, that investing in the markets is the way to build wealth. I have less confidence in the responses seen so far to inflation, bank sector troubles, and the mounting cost of US debt service. Interest expense in 2023 on US debt is expected to rise 35% this year, to $640 billion, and to 3\u20444 of a trillion dollars next year. This all gets added to our growing deficit. This means investors around the world look increasingly to the markets to stay ahead of inflation and uncertainty. It has grown clear to more and more people that holding onto cash, when it is earning low or no interest, is a losing proposition. We let all investors know that Interactive Brokers pays its clients 4.33% on their cash balances, without having to sweep. We continuously add relevant content to our IBKR Campus educational website, to make it simple to use and easier for clients to find topics of interest to better understand the world of investing. We will serve our customers, in over 200 countries and territories, and educate them about their options \u2013 both their opportunities and the security. We continue to add accounts, and are excited about where our position \u2013 as a leader in international access, with a strong and safe balance sheet, offering a good deal to people as well as comprehensive educational tools for all \u2013 will take us. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Paul Brody, who will go through the numbers for the quarter. Paul? Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will talk to you next quarter end."

            "content": "Thank you, Nancy. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call. As usual, we're going to review the first quarter operating results, and then we'll open it up for questions. Starting with our Revenue items on page 3 of the release, we recorded another strong quarter, with record net revenues that exceeded $1 billion in a quarter for the first time. With ongoing customer account and balance sheet growth, we continue to expand our potential for both commission and interest revenues in the future. Commissions were strong, reaching $357 million despite mixed equity markets worldwide. Futures and options volumes reached record levels, while stock share volumes declined from last year's quarter, once again driven by a drop in trading of lower-priced stocks. Net interest income of $637 million reflected higher interest from margin loans and segregated cash, owing to increases in benchmark rates and a larger segregated cash portfolio. US benchmark rates have moved from an average effective rate of 12 basis points in the first quarter of last year to 451 basis points this quarter. These gains were partially offset by the higher interest we paid on customer credit balances, as our longstanding policy is to pass through rate hikes above 50 basis points to our customers on their qualified funds. Other fees and services generated $43 million, with the biggest contributors being market data fees of $18 million, options exchange liquidity payments of $8 million, and risk exposure fee revenue of $6 million. The drop from the prior year quarter was driven primarily by the risk-off positioning of customers, which led to a $9 million reduction in risk exposure fees. Other income of $19 million includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings, and without these excluded items, other income was a $22 million loss for the quarter as we removed realized and unrealized gains on our US Treasury portfolio. Turning to expenses, Execution, Clearing & Distribution costs rose 34% versus last year, led by higher volumes in options and futures, which carry higher fees, lower liquidity rebates, and higher regulatory transaction fees. We find it useful to measure what we call Gross Transactional Profit, which is commissions less the pure volume-driven Execution & Clearing costs. As a percent of commission revenues, Execution & Clearing costs, which are driven by a combination of trading volume, exchange rebates and changing fee schedules, were 21% this quarter, in other words, a Gross Transactional Profit of 79%. Market Data expense, a pass-through item, is included in \u201cExecution, Clearing & Distribution Fees\u201d, while the corresponding Market Data revenue is reported in \u201cOther fees and services\u201d rather than in Commissions. For this purpose, in the first quarter we exclude $18 million in primarily Market Data expense. Compensation & Benefits expense rose $17 million, or 15%, over the prior year, driven by hiring in Europe and APAC and, in part, by inflation. While up in dollar terms for the quarter, Compensation & Benefits expense fell to 13% of our adjusted Net Revenues, versus 16% last year and somewhat below its historical level. Our headcount at quarter-end was 2,872. G&A expenses were down 5% versus last year's first quarter, primarily on lower advertising and legal expenses. Our adjusted pretax margin was a record 71%. While higher interest rates benefit us, automation remains our key means of maintaining consistently high margins, as well as continued expense control while we hire talented people and invest in the future of our business. Income tax expense of $61 million reflects the sum of the public company's $31 million and the operating companies' $30 million. Moving to the balance sheet on page 5 of our release, our total assets were $119 billion at the end of the quarter, with growth over the last year driven by increases in our segregated cash and securities. We maintain a balance sheet aimed at supporting our growing business and providing ample financial resources during volatile markets, with maximum flexibility and short-term liquidity. We have no long-term debt. The duration of our investment portfolio as of March 31st was 24 days. Turning to our operating data, on pages 6 and 7 of the release, our contract volumes for all customers were strong, reaching their highest quarterly level in both options and futures, up 2% and 4%, respectively, over the year-ago quarter. Stock share volume was down 22% versus last year's first quarter, and the drop off was largely attributable to investors moving to higher quality stocks, as trading in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks was impacted most. On page 7, you can see that our account growth remains robust, with over 100,000 net account adds in the quarter, and total accounts at 2.2 million, up 21% over the prior year. Total Customer DARTs were 2.1 million trades per day, down 19% from the stronger prior-year quarter. Our Cleared IBKR Pro Customers paid an average of $3.16 Commission per Cleared Commissionable Order, up 23% from last year as our clients' volume mix included higher per order contributions from all product categories, and particularly from stocks and options. Page 8 presents our Net Interest Margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income more than doubled to $637 million on the year-ago quarter, reflecting stronger earnings on segregated cash and margin loans, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. After a series of seven target rate increases in 2022, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates twice this quarter, by 25 basis points each in February and March. Many other central banks also raised rates this quarter. This group includes the UK, Canada, Australia and Hong Kong, as well as the Eurozone and Switzerland. Net interest on segregated cash was $603 million, primarily due to Federal Reserve rate hikes but also to our managing to short duration on invested funds, which has allowed us to more closely match asset and liability maturities and to pick up benchmark rate increases quickly. At March 31st, our US portfolio duration was 24 days, so the investments roll over into new, higher, rates with a fairly short lag time. A 38% increase over the year-ago quarter in average segregated cash and securities balances also drove interest income higher. Margin loan interest rose to $477 million, up significantly from $149 million last year, despite average margin loan balances declining 17% from last year's first quarter. Higher rates, in the US and internationally, have driven higher margin interest income. Securities lending net interest was $88 million, down 20% from the year-ago quarter. It's worth noting that, while securities lending opportunities maintained a relatively strong pace, it is also the case that as benchmark rates rise, a greater portion of the revenue generated by lending securities is reflected in interest on Segregated Cash, because the cash collateral received is invested as segregated funds. We estimate this impact to be about $41 million for the quarter vs last year. In other words, without this shift in reporting line items, net interest from securities lending would be $129 million, up 18% from the year-ago quarter. Interest on Customer Credit Balances, or the interest we pay our customers, grew as higher rates in many currencies led to our paying interest on qualifying balances as we pass through rate increases. We paid $653 million to our customers on these balances in the first quarter. Fully rate sensitive balances were roughly unchanged at about $20 billion. We consider our policy offering clients a full pass-through of all rate hikes after the first 50 basis points on their qualified cash a significant component in our success, and one that sets us apart. We believe this leads to clients choosing to keep their cash with us, especially active clients who do not want to use sweep programs that prevent them from immediately accessing their cash to invest. As Thomas mentioned, on balance we do not see clients moving their cash away from us. Now, for our estimates of the impact of increases in rates \u2013 Given market expectations of possibly one or more rate hikes to come, we estimate the effects of increases in the Fed Funds rate to produce an additional annual net interest income of approximately $50 million for each 25 basis increase in the benchmark. Note that our starting point for these estimates is March 31, with the Fed Funds effective rate at 4.83%, and based on balances at that date. About 26% of our customer cash balances is not in US dollars, so estimates of US rate change effects exclude those currencies. We estimate a 25 basis point increase in all the relevant non-USD benchmark rates would produce additional annual net interest income of $26 million, and rising to about $100 million at a 100 basis point rate increase. In conclusion, the company generated a strong performance in the first quarter in a complex and volatile environment, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base and deliver our core services to customers, all at low cost and while offering meaningful cash interest, as we manage the business effectively with strong risk and expense controls. And with that, we will now open up the line for questions. Thank you. Sure. So, this quarter's effect is a onetime effect. Let me explain it this way. As you know, we have considered that our investment in the treasury portfolio to have temporary mark-to-market fluctuations, which are reflected in our financial statements\u2013 both the income statement and the balance sheet. By the end of the year, the accumulated losses on our treasury portfolio because of market movement, were about $39 million. That was all in the income statement and the balance sheet. For non-GAAP reporting, which is what we call non-core to our operating results in the release\u2013 it's in the earnings release every quarter, we pull out those mark-to-market effects. So cumulatively, by the end of the year, we had a $39 million accumulated loss that we had pulled out for the purposes of the non-core reporting. We have pulled out the losses and that raised the non-core reporting. During the first quarter, we liquidated some securities rather than holding them to maturity. And by liquidating them, it erases the previous accumulated loss. In effect, putting it back in when it was realized upon the sale of those securities. So those were sold. That also played a role in reducing our duration on the remaining portfolio down to 24 days, extremely short. And we wouldn't expect much mark-to-market impact at all going forward because it is unlikely to be much on a very short duration portfolio. We make investment decisions from time to time based on market conditions. We felt that it made sense to sell a security and reinvest in currently higher rates. And looking forward, it also reduced fluctuation in our mark-to-market results. Had we held it to maturity, it would have resulted in approaching par value each quarter until what would have been the end of this year\u2013 they were not very long term. At the end of the year, they would have made it all the way back to par value, and we would have recaptured the exact thing that we declared this quarter all at once, we would have done it over four quarters toward maturity. Well, other income includes investments and various other things. So, it's a little difficult to say that it has a run rate. Investments will rise and fall over time. And it's difficult to pin that down. Yes. Let's remember that our currency diversification strategy that we call the GLOBAL, the result of currencies versus dollar going up and down are a component of other income. Sometimes it's a large component. This quarter, it was practically nothing. So, that's at least for you because we disclose the composition of our GLOBAL, that's for you a predictable number because you can imply exchange rates and make an estimate."

            "name": "Thomas Peterffy",
            "content": "It also allowed us to reduce our taxes a little bit last year. Milan, would you like to answer that? So, what other stats do you have in mind? Yes. So, we are #6 as far as number of hedge funds. Ahead of us was Credit Suisse that is not going to be there this quarter. So, we'll be #5. And then ahead of us is also Bank of America\u2013 barely ahead of us by number of hedge funds. So, we believe we will be #4 or #5 the next time Preqin issues their stats on prime brokers for hedge funds. And it will probably be in the fall. The average size is around, I think, $8 million. So, they are the smaller funds. Many of them\u2013 I mean, quite a few of them lose money and quite a few of them make money. So, some of them drop out and some of them become large, and we hope that they will stay with us. We also have large hedge funds, but we are probably their second or third or sometimes fourth prime broker. So, they come to us because, a) our executions, they like our executions; b) they like the fact that they can see our short inventory and the rates at which they can borrow various equity issues from us. And when they compare that to their primary hedge fund, they either use our rates to bid them up into giving them a better rate or they actually ask us to borrow the shares from. Paul? Well, on the way down, we would decrease by the same amount we increased by, except for the fact that we are getting in more and more accounts. So, to the extent, we'll have more clients to do more trades and to keep with us more cash, it is going to be moderated. But if we went back to zero interest rates, of course, our interest income would be very similar to what it was a year ago. But I do not believe that we will get back to zero. So, it is generally true that a new account starts at $3 and it grows to $6 in the first year and then goes to $9 after 2 or 3 years. So, I do not expect these customers to be any different from that. Well to tell you frankly, for the past 10 days or so, our commissions are certainly lower than they were in the preceding 10 days. So, the banking crisis certainly contributed to some stronger activity that seems to have subsided now. But generally, when markets go down, the activity increases and when they stop going down and start to slowly climb up the activity decreases. So that's what we are seeing in the commission income side. Well, unfortunately, I did not. So, the incoming moneys are about the same as they were a month ago or two months or three months ago. It's very steady\u2014we haven't seen any pickup and we also haven't seen any drawdowns. So, it is certainly sustainable because it's less expensive for people to take a position in one-day options, one day ahead of news, right? Previously, they had to take a position that would have several days to run even though they would take the position a day ahead of the news. So, it is cheaper for them to use the one-day option. Also, when people want to take a position in a larger portfolio, it's easier for them to accumulate on one-day, say Standard and Poor's options and trade the portfolio on a market on close order. And that way, it's a lot cheaper for them to buy or sell that portfolio. Very strange that you should ask that question at the time that many of our peers appear to have insufficient amounts of capital. So no, we are very proud to have as much capital as we do, and we hope to keep growing it. So, you will see that \u2013 maybe you notice our heads cropping up all over the place. We're trying to advertise our 4.33% interest that we pay on instantly available cash. We roughly have doubled our advertising spending a month ago. So, you will see a much larger advertising spend in the next quarter. I think this is a CEO question."

After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Nancy Stuebe, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNancy Stuebe: Good afternoon. and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us today are Thomas Peterffy, our Founder and Chairman; Milan Galik, our President and CEO; and Paul Brody, our CFO. I will be presenting Milan's comments on the business, and all three will be available at our Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the Company's belief regarding future events, which, by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the Company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. This quarter, the long-awaited interest rate cut in the U.S. finally happened. The market proceeded to rally on the news. The S&P 500 rose 5.5% this quarter. Joining higher indices in nearly every global market, save Japan and following rate cuts in the U.K., Canada, Europe and China. For the industry as a whole, options contract volumes were up 12% over last year, reaching a new record and surpassing even the strong first quarter. CME futures volumes were up 27% versus last year, also a record. As investors were eager to trade interest rate futures, in particular, in order to wager on rate changes. As for equities, overall U.S. industry volumes are up versus last year, though down slightly from last quarter, as the Magnificent Seven lost some of their grip on U.S. market performance. These stocks contributed just 12% of the S&P's gain this quarter versus 95% last quarter with more than half of them down. However, as in prior recent quarters, it appears so far that investors are holding on to these positions and have not made changes like selling them to buy new names. Against this industry backdrop, our options, futures and stock volumes were all up versus last year. Versus the second quarter, our volumes are up in futures and options. So in equities, they were down slightly as investors continue to gravitate towards higher-priced stocks so the notional value of equities traded rose. We added 196,000 new accounts in the third quarter behind only the mean stock days of the first quarter of 2021. New accounts meant more cash in those accounts, which helped raise our client credit balances 19% to a record $116.7 billion. Margin loans were up 28% from last year our client equity was up 46% to $541.5 billion, the first time we ended the quarter with over $0.5 trillion. Rising markets and the anticipation of lower rates continue to lead clients to feel more comfortable taking on risk. So, in addition to taking on more leverage using margin loans, they also took on more assertive positions, which increased our exposure fee revenue. Active markets yielded strong financial results, both commission revenue and net interest income reached records as did total net revenues. We maintained our focus on expenses, meaning our pretax income also reached a record, and both our reported and adjusted pretax profit margins were an industry-leading 72%. Broken down by geography, our accounts and client equity once again grew fastest in Europe and Asia as growing numbers of investors worldwide want access to international and particularly U.S. markets. Of our five client segments, the fastest account growth was again seen with individuals with introducing brokers and proprietary traders not far behind. On the client equity side, financial advisers, once again grew the fastest, followed by i-brokers and individuals. Commission growth was fastest for our proprietary traders, while net interest income growth was led by individuals followed by financial advisers. At the Company level, we experienced another productive quarter. On August 1, the previously announced merger of IB Central Europe and IB Ireland was completed. As a result, all of our EEA clients can benefit equally from an expanded offering of products and services. The upfront cost of this consolidation was $12 million, which is reflected in our G&A expense. Going forward, assuming today's level of business and regulatory fees, we expect annual savings of $7 million from having only one European brokerage business and one regulator to report to. On September 1, we opened a licensed office in Dubai, solidifying our presence in the Middle East region. We launched trading in both equities and futures on Bursa Malaysia this quarter. We've expanded our offerings to include 22-hour-a-day trading in U.S. treasuries, European government bonds, U.K. Gilts and Swiss franc-denominated corporate and sovereign bonds. In addition to over 10,000 U.S. stocks, ETFs and equity index options, non-U.S. clients can now also trade contracts or difference or CFDs on more than 3,500 U.S. stocks and ETFs during overnight hours. We upgraded our API functionality to provide new introducing broker clients with faster and easier integration. Rather than relying on multiple separate code libraries, our partners can now access our extensive range of services through a single unified interface. In our IBKR ATS, for several years now, we have operated an options crossing session in which we seek opposite side liquidity for marketable orders in U.S. options, providing customers the opportunity for price improvement. We have now added the same functionality for customer U.S. options orders priced inside the NBBO. When we succeed in pairing these tweener orders, liquidity in our ATS, the customer benefit by obtaining a guaranteed fill on their nonmarketable order as well as the opportunity for further price improvement in an on-exchange price improvement auction. We have seen excellent participation by our liquidity providers in this program and our customers who place nonmarketable orders in U.S. listed options are seeing substantial meaningful benefits as a result. We believe this further demonstrates and enhances our position as the premier broker for options trading. And finally, we launched ForecastEx, our forecast contract exchange on August 1. After a 2.5-year approval process, we received the green light from the CFTC and are looking forward to seeing its performance. Investors can now buy yes and no contracts on the outcome of events that were previously unavailable for direct investment or hedging, whether it's the release of key economic data, results of U.S. elections, or long-term developments like future global temperatures or the size of the U.S. national debt, investors can manage exposure or hedge their existing positions. And to ensure it is easy for interested liquidity providers to connect with us, we have both fixed and restful API connectivity ready for them. Together with the Interactive Brokers team, I look forward to continuing the work on the many projects we have lined up, much as planned for the quarters ahead. Our pipeline of new business and new initiatives remains healthy, and we look forward to sharing the results with you as we introduce them. With that, I will turn the call over to Paul Brody. Paul?\nPaul Brody: Thank you, Nancy. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. We'll start with our revenue items on Page 3 of the release. We're pleased with our financial results this quarter as we again produced record net revenues and pretax income. Commissions rose to a record $435 million. This quarter, both options and futures volumes reached new quarterly highs as we sell active customers across global regions participated in the markets. Net interest income also reached a quarterly record of $802 million despite rate cuts in several countries including the full impact of second quarter cuts in Europe, Canada and Switzerland and partial quarter impact of third quarter cuts in those countries as well as in the U.S., U.K. and Hong Kong. The continued risk on environment in the quarter led to a significant increase in margin borrowing and strong account growth led to increases in our segregated cash portfolio. These increases were partially offset by the interest paid to our customers on their cash balances. Interactive Brokers pays clients holding U.S. dollars, the benchmark Fed funds rate less 50 basis points on their qualified funds which makes us attractive compared to other brokers and banks and competitive with money market funds. And as a truly global broker, we pay similarly competitive rates on qualified balances in 20 other currencies. Other fees and services generated $72 million, up 38% from the prior year driven by the continued risk on positioning of customers, which is reflected in an increase in the risk exposure fees with contributions also from payments for order flow from options exchange mandated programs and FDIC sweep fees as well. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Note that several of these are noncore items and therefore, are excluded in our adjusted earnings. Without these excluded items, other income was an $18 million gain for the quarter. Turning to expenses. Execution, clearing and distribution costs were $116 million in the quarter, up 18% over the year ago quarter, predominantly from higher regulatory fees that were introduced by the SEC earlier this year. The SEC fee is a pass-through to customers, so it does not impact our profitability. As a percent of commission revenues, execution and clearing costs, were 21% in the third quarter for a gross transactional profit margin of 79%. We calculate this by excluding from execution, clearing and distribution, $21 million of non-transaction-based costs mainly market data fees, which do not have a direct commission revenue component. Compensation and benefits expense was $145 million for the quarter for a ratio of compensation expense to adjusted net revenues of 11%, similar to last year's quarter. We remain focused on defense discipline while targeting specific functions to grow the business. Inside our year-over-year staff increase of only 1%, we had good success in hiring talented software developers. And partially offsetting that, we reduced compliance staff as we went into full operational mode with our in-house developed compliance system. Our headcount at September 30th was 2,969. G&A expenses were $75 million, up from the year ago quarter, led by a onetime expense to consolidate our European operations and expenses related to legal and regulatory matters. Excluding these items, G&A was up $9 million to $51 million, primarily on higher advertising expense. Our pretax margin was 72% for the quarter, both as reported and as adjusted. Income taxes of $80 million reflects the sum of the public company's $45 million and the operating company's $35 million. The public company's effective tax rate was 18.4%, within its usual range. Moving to our balance sheet on Page 5 of the release. Our total assets ended the quarter 23% higher than the prior year quarter at $148 billion, driven by strong growth in margin lending. New account growth also helped propel our customer credit balances by 19% to a new record level. And we believe that our strong financial standing and competitive interest rates provide customers with an attractive place to hold their idle cash. We continue to have no long-term debt and healthy profitability drove our 21% increase in firm equity over the prior year quarter. And in recognition of this growth, we allocated capital to a dividend increase last quarter. We maintained a balance sheet geared towards supporting growth in our existing business, and helping us win new business by demonstrating our strength to prospective clients and partners. In our operating data on Pages 6 and 7, we had record customer contract volume in both options and futures. And options and our contract volumes rose 35% over the prior year quarter, well above industry growth. And futures contract volumes rose by 13%. Stock share volumes rose by 22%, also above industry growth. Stock share volume generally increased versus last year as clients in our largest markets, gravitated to larger, higher-quality names and trading relatively less in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks. Growth in the notional dollar value of shares traded well outpaced the growth in share volumes. On Page 7, you can see that total customer DARTs were 2.7 million trades per day, up 42% from the prior year. Commission per cleared commissionable order of $2.83 was down from last year, primarily due to smaller average order sizes across product classes, which is more than compensated by stronger volumes. Turning to net interest income on Page 8. Total GAAP net interest income was $802 million for the quarter, up 9% on the prior year, while our NIM net interest income was $826 million or $24 million higher. In the NIM computation, we include some income that is classified as other fees or other income on our income statement but we believe is more appropriately considered interest. Our net interest income reflects strength in margin loan and segregated cash interest, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. Several central banks made cuts to their benchmark rates this quarter, the U.S., U.K. and Hong Kong cut for the first time since early 2020, while Europe, Switzerland and Canada cut their rates both this quarter and last. Reflecting relatively flat benchmark rates year-on-year, our segregated cash interest income rose 5% on a 6% increase in average balances, while margin loan interest rose by 26% on a 28% increase in average balances. The average duration of our U.S. treasury portfolio remains at less than 30 days. With the U.S. dollar yield curve continuing to be inverted except in the very near term. We have been maximizing what we earn by focusing on higher short-term yields rather than accept the significantly lower yields of longer maturities. This strategy allows us to maintain a relatively tight maturity match between our assets and liabilities and positions us to be nimble if the yield curve does revert. Securities lending net interest has not been as strong as in prior quarters for three main reasons. First, an extremely strong stock market with a backdrop of a falling rate environment, coincides with a smaller proportion of clients looking to put on shorts. Second, there are fewer hard-to-borrow names industry-wide, not only because the overall market is rising sharply, but also due to the weakness in some of the drivers relevant to securities lending, including IPOs, low market volatility and merger and acquisition activity. So even though the notional value of what we are lending was higher than last year's quarter, overall industry average lending rates are lower. Finally, as noted on previous calls, higher average interest rates versus prior year periods means more of what we earn from securities lending is classified as interest on segregated cash. To more accurately reflect all the income, we earn from our securities lending business, we estimate that if the additional interest earned and paid on cash collateral were included under securities borrowed and loan, then total net revenue related to our securities lending business would have been about $156 million versus $181 million in the year ago quarter. This additional revenue would be reclassified from the line items, interest earned on segregated cash and interest paid on customer credit balances. So overall, it would have no effect on our net interest margin. Interest on customer credit balances, the interest we pay to our customers on the cash and their accounts rose on higher balances from new account growth. As we have noted in the past, the high interest rates we pay on customer cash, currently 4.33% on qualified U.S. dollar balances is a significant attraction to new customers. Fully rate-sensitive customer balances were $19.5 billion this quarter versus $17.1 billion in the year ago quarter. Together with firm equity, most of which consists of interest-earning assets, total fully rate-sensitive balances were $33.6 billion. Now for our estimates of the impact of changes in rates. Given market expectations of further rate cuts in the future, we estimate the effect of a 25 basis point decrease in the benchmark Fed funds rate to be a $64 million reduction in annual net interest income. Note that our starting point for this estimate is September 30 with the Fed funds effective rate at 4.83% and balances as of that date. Any growth in our balance sheet and interest-earning assets would reduce this impact. About 24% of our customer cash balances is not in U.S. dollars. So estimates of the U.S. rate change exclude those currencies. We estimate the effect of decreases in all of the relevant non-U.S. benchmark rates, which reduced annual net interest income by $18 million for each 25 basis point decrease in those benchmarks. At a high level, a full 1% decrease in all benchmark rates will decrease our annual net interest income by $328 million. This takes into account rate-sensitive customer balances and firm equity. In conclusion, we posted another financially strong quarter in net revenues and pretax margin reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base and deliver on our core value proposition to customers while scaling the business. Our business strategy continues to be effective. Automating as much of the brokerage business as possible, continuously improving and expanding what we offer while minimizing what we charge. With that, we will open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And one moment for our first question. And our first question comes from Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Moley: I just had one on the U.S. election forecast contracts that you mentioned in your prepared remarks, launched on October 3, about 4 days after launch. You issued a press release and you had already done about a million contracts. So, I was hoping you can maybe just provide some color on how these contracts are being utilized, where the volumes have come from up to this point? Is it new accounts? Is it existing accounts? And then if you can maybe just help us understand how you're thinking about the opportunity from a new account acquisition standpoint, given your -- I think one of the only brokers out there that currently offers these contracts?\nMilan Galik: We launched ForecastEx on August 1. We added the political events on fourth of October. We've seen around 800 clients trading so far. The volume, yes, up to yesterday was around $6 million. Most of it is in the election contracts. So, the election political contracts is what currently resonates with our clientele. It should be noted that the political contracts can only be traded by the U.S. clients, there is a regulation, speaking to that. And generally, the rest of the contracts are offered by Interactive Brokers LLC clients to LLC clients and Hong Kong clients. In other words, the functionality is not yet fully available worldwide. There are some regulatory approvals that are needed, for example, in Europe. As to who is trading this, we did not look at whether it's new accounts or the old accounts. We were very excited that the judge decides in favor of listing the political contracts on ForecastEx and similar platforms. We hope that the political contracts will attract new clients to our platform.\nPatrick Moley: Okay. And just a follow-up on the competitive landscape in U.S. retail trading large mobile-based competitor of yours plans to launch index options in the fourth quarter. They've said that they are planning to introduce those contracts at a lower price point than many of the incumbents. So, understanding that nothing has been announced up to this point specifically on where they're going to be priced. Just wanted to get your thoughts on whether you think this is going to create any sort of pricing pressure on index options across the industry and how you think it might just impact the overall, I guess, competitive landscape for your index options.\nMilan Galik: Well, we will have to see how they're going to be pricing the index options. Index options have in prior years, be mostly traded by professionals and sophisticated traders, more recently when large amount of volume was attracted to the zero-day options more diverse clientele started trading this. It's difficult for me to estimate the impact, given that they haven't yet gone out and they did not announce the pricing either.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from James Yaro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJames Yaro: So, I do think there's a lot of optimism among investors on the ForecastEx business. So maybe, Milan, if you could just speak to the time frame over which you expect this to reach scale and actually have a material impact on your results, and I'll let you define materiality, however you'd like. And then just in terms of whether there's any market risk to your balance sheet from these contracts? Obviously, they're different than equities or options that we're all familiar with. And then if so, how you might hedge them?\nMilan Galik: Thanks for your question.\nThomas Peterffy: Would this be okay if I'll -- Milan will it be okay if I.\nMilan Galik: Yes, of course.\nThomas Peterffy: So, look, this has been my baby for a long time. This ForecastEx thing. And when it will reach scale, I think it will scale later this year. Namely in the last few days of the election, we expect that it will really pick up. We have some other interest coming in to forecast. And so, that's where we are with it. We're extremely excited about it. And the election -- we look at the election thing as a very lucky circumstance because there is so much interest on it, that it will draw in other people who then will be customers for the economic and climate contracts. And that is what is really going to be our long-term focus with ForecastEx. The economic indicators in the climate contracts. The elections are just [indiscernible] interlude.\nJames Yaro: Okay. That's very clear, thank you so much Thomas. Maybe just on the RIA channel, which I do think has taken a leg higher in terms of growth. And it appears you are adding larger RIAs than historically. Could you just speak to the growth trajectory in that channel and whether the client base you are adding is different than in the past?\nMilan Galik: Well, what -- we were hoping to see that more financial adviser would come to our platform as the platform is getting better and better. And a lot of clients are currently on Schwab's platform. And as we all know, Schwab is not paying a lot of interest on uninvested cash. So, we had a lot of hopes for the accounts to come in. Some of them came over not as many as we would like. What I can tell you is that we are continuously working on the improvements to the RIA platform. If everything goes well, we're going to be announcing something new in this quarter, this coming quarter, if things slow down, maybe the following one. There is going to be a new and exciting functionality coming online, and we are hopeful that it's going to translate into more RIAs on our platform.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies LLC. Your line is now open.\nDan Fannon: I think one of the comments you mentioned were that new accounts coming on with more cash than previously. So, I was hoping you could talk about the makeup of those accounts today versus, say, a year ago? And what might -- what some of the different characteristics might be.\nMilan Galik: Paul, would you like to take this one? I think this was your comment.\nPaul Brody: Well, it was more of a general comment that new accounts always bring more cash. I don't think that we're seeing -- there's a distinction in the character of those accounts. That's -- if there's something illuminating there, it's which client segment at what rate they're growing and we said individuals are growing the fastest, followed by the advisers and the introducing brokers. So...\nThomas Peterffy: Prop traders are the second most lucrative segment. And we do have more and more prop traders coming in, and they are the ones that have more cash in the account -- in the account and individual trader certainly.\nPaul Brody: And they certainly generate more volume.\nDan Fannon: Understood. Okay. And then just as a follow-up, Paul, maybe just as you think about expenses, some onetime items in G&A but maybe into the fourth quarter? And as you think about next year and budgeting, given the strength in account growth, how should we think about the flow-through from a marketing perspective or rather more discretionary type expenses on a more annual basis.\nPaul Brody: I think Milan can address the marketing and advertising perhaps. On the rest, we try to point out the onetime expenses so that they can be dropped out when giving you a better picture of the run rate, but nothing else extraordinary.\nMilan Galik: Well, for marketing our aim is to be increasing the spent approximately 20% a year. We are continuously monitoring the various marketing channels we have been utilizing over time. When a particular ad on a particular channel does better, we spend more money. If it does less well, we decrease the expenditure. But going forward, that is roughly the expectations, 20% annual increase on the marketing spend.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Chris Allen from Citi. Your line is now open.\nChris Allen: I wanted to talk a little bit about trading activity per account. When you look over the years, it's been consistently coming in, but this year, it's stabilized and actually improved a little bit. And I'm guessing some of that is due to mix shift from a client perspective, as you alluded to, prop accounts are seeing positive inflows. Wondering if that's a factor and/or increased hedge fund activity and how you're thinking about that moving forward?\nMilan Galik: Well, if we look at the prop trading account, their commissions -- the commissions that they generate increased faster than any other segments generated commission, either individual accounts or even hedge funds. So that is -- that is the reason I think you see some lot of stabilization. Previous years, what we've been seeing is as a lot of accounts arrived from, for example, eye brokers, they were trading a little less than the professional and active traders we prefer.\nChris Allen: Got it. And then, when we're thinking about just the revenue outlook moving forward, the big push-back on the stock is that NII will be declining in a lower rate environment. How are you thinking about the offsets here in terms of increased margin balances, trading activity? Anything else that we should be conceptualizing in a lower rate environment moving forward?\nMilan Galik: Well, there is a predictable hit the net interest income is going to take on the interest that we earn on the uninvested cash. We alluded to the size of that effect. What we can, though expect is the offset that we're going to receive from new accounts that continue to add up to our platform and the new free cash that is coming in as well. So, there is going to be a tug of war, if you will, between these two effects. If we see further decreases in the interest rates, but we are optimistic going forward about the account growth. So, we are not too worried about that. As far as the commissions are concerned, that obviously to an extent, depends on how busy the markets are, whether there is volatility present or not. But given that we have been over years, attracting accounts from various segments, including the hedge funds, including the prop traders who trade for living, we expect continued healthy commission income.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is now open.\nBrennan Hawken: During the quarter, we saw Chinese stimulus announced. Curious to hear what impacts you've seen on customers, either within China or whether or not there's been a broader impact across the region of Asia?\nMilan Galik: Well, the stimulus that was announced by the Chinese government is a relatively recent phenomenon. I think it happened towards the end of September maybe last week of September. We then all witnessed the very sudden run-up in the prices of the Chinese securities and Chinese indexes which since then somewhat subsided. So, I do not have information as to what exactly it meant in terms of the incoming accounts. We can comment on that next time we meet three months from now.\nBrennan Hawken: Okay. And then the legal and regulatory charges, is there any color that you can give on that was related to?\nMilan Galik: Sorry, which regulatory charge?\nBrennan Hawken: The $9 million legal and regulatory charge that you took in G&A?\nMilan Galik: 9 million.\nPaul Brody: We'll, yes. So that's -- every quarter, we make an evaluation of open cases and so forth, and we have to make -- we make reserves accordingly, when we can determine that they're probable and estimable. So, it's not out of the ordinary, but it was large enough to make an impact on the overall G&A.\nMilan Galik: Just like any other financial company that is regulated by multiple regulators is continuously scrutinized by regulators. There are constant sweeps. They are specific investigations of individual companies. We are dealing with those on a frequent basis. Our legal department advises us if they feel that an increase in the reserve -- legal reserve is appropriate. That is what they did this quarter, so we have increased the reserve.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question, please. And our next question comes from Benjamin Budish from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Budish: I wanted to follow up on one of your earlier comments on ForecastEx. You mentioned that is largely available in the U.S. right now. So maybe a two-parter. I guess, what would the path be to making contracts like the election contracts available outside the U.S. And I'm curious, what are your thoughts on providing a similar type of product locally in many of the countries in which you operate? I know the kind of value proposition that you talk about is the ability to access the U.S. markets in particular. But I imagine this is the sort of thing that a lot of investors would be potentially interested in for the local market. So curious what that path could look like if you see it as one that might be feasible.\nThomas Peterffy: So, we are not currently able to activate this for European or British customers, and we are also not able to onboard Canadian customers at this time. But we are -- with the regulators in all these places, and we're trying to get them not necessarily for the election contracts. But for the regular economic indicator and climate indicator contract. And we are, of course, hoping to eventually expand that to sort of social trends. The issue here with this contract is that we need an arbiter that is an uncorruptible arbiter. So namely, it has to be a state-regulated agency that publishes the results. So, nobody can claim that the results are manipulated or something like that.\nBenjamin Budish: Understood, very helpful. Maybe one other follow-up on an earlier comment. You mentioned that you're opening up a new office in Dubai. Could you maybe talk a little bit about your plans for the region as this perhaps related to going after a broader introducing broker opportunity is about speaking out large wealthy traders, hedge funds in the regions? What are your sort of plans to do there?\nMilan Galik: Well, we're trying to attract the more sophisticated accounts, maybe hedge funds, maybe investors with accounts of significant size device as we can read in the news, a very hot place nowadays, a lot of expats coming in from various countries in the world. So we have some optimistic expectations as to how we're going to do with that office.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Macrae Sykes from GAMCO. Your line is now open.\nMacrae Sykes: I actually had just two, but I'll lump them together. We've been through a few election cycles with the platform. I was curious if you could talk about some of the dynamics in trading before and after major general elections. Would you expect anything different this cycle? And then assuming after a four-year drought of IPOs, we do start to get a little more constructive capital markets activity in '25, how would that impact some of the segments and trading dynamics on the platform?\nMilan Galik: I think we can expect increased volatility, especially as we approach the election day. I don't know whether you must remember the volatility that we we've seen in the previous elections, I think very similar circumstances will be observed this time around, so higher volumes, higher volatility that is what I would expect. And I'm sorry, what was your second question?\nMacrae Sykes: Assuming we get a more constructive IPO market next year, how does that affect some of the trading dynamics with some of the different segments, institutional versus retail?\nMilan Galik: Well, what it means for us is we participate in the IPO market in Asia. Just today, I've read some news that like a Chinese company is applying for listing on the Hong Kong market. So as that IPO activity picks up, we expect to earn some fees resulting from these new listings. That's going to be impact on our results. Now IPOs are always hot when they get listed, investors are interested in participating in trading them on day one. That is when our platform is ready for trading them on day one, so that is going to generate some volumes and some increased interest as well.\nPaul Brody: We also usually see securities lending opportunities go up around those IPOs and we make those available as well.\nOperator: And thank you and one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from James Yaro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJames Yaro: Thomas, the stock has appreciated very substantially this year, but I don't believe that you have returned to selling stock. Maybe you could just speak to the key considerations as you think about whether you might return to selling?\nThomas Peterffy: Well, to the extent, if I get some large bidders, I may offer them stock. But I'm not about to go and sell into the market because when the news since the market, the stock tanks. I'm not getting the price I'd like to get.\nOperator: And thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Nancy Stuebe for closing remarks.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thanks again, and we will talk to you next quarter end.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Nancy Stuebe",
            "content": "Good afternoon. and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us today are Thomas Peterffy, our Founder and Chairman; Milan Galik, our President and CEO; and Paul Brody, our CFO. I will be presenting Milan's comments on the business, and all three will be available at our Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the Company's belief regarding future events, which, by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the Company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. This quarter, the long-awaited interest rate cut in the U.S. finally happened. The market proceeded to rally on the news. The S&P 500 rose 5.5% this quarter. Joining higher indices in nearly every global market, save Japan and following rate cuts in the U.K., Canada, Europe and China. For the industry as a whole, options contract volumes were up 12% over last year, reaching a new record and surpassing even the strong first quarter. CME futures volumes were up 27% versus last year, also a record. As investors were eager to trade interest rate futures, in particular, in order to wager on rate changes. As for equities, overall U.S. industry volumes are up versus last year, though down slightly from last quarter, as the Magnificent Seven lost some of their grip on U.S. market performance. These stocks contributed just 12% of the S&P's gain this quarter versus 95% last quarter with more than half of them down. However, as in prior recent quarters, it appears so far that investors are holding on to these positions and have not made changes like selling them to buy new names. Against this industry backdrop, our options, futures and stock volumes were all up versus last year. Versus the second quarter, our volumes are up in futures and options. So in equities, they were down slightly as investors continue to gravitate towards higher-priced stocks so the notional value of equities traded rose. We added 196,000 new accounts in the third quarter behind only the mean stock days of the first quarter of 2021. New accounts meant more cash in those accounts, which helped raise our client credit balances 19% to a record $116.7 billion. Margin loans were up 28% from last year our client equity was up 46% to $541.5 billion, the first time we ended the quarter with over $0.5 trillion. Rising markets and the anticipation of lower rates continue to lead clients to feel more comfortable taking on risk. So, in addition to taking on more leverage using margin loans, they also took on more assertive positions, which increased our exposure fee revenue. Active markets yielded strong financial results, both commission revenue and net interest income reached records as did total net revenues. We maintained our focus on expenses, meaning our pretax income also reached a record, and both our reported and adjusted pretax profit margins were an industry-leading 72%. Broken down by geography, our accounts and client equity once again grew fastest in Europe and Asia as growing numbers of investors worldwide want access to international and particularly U.S. markets. Of our five client segments, the fastest account growth was again seen with individuals with introducing brokers and proprietary traders not far behind. On the client equity side, financial advisers, once again grew the fastest, followed by i-brokers and individuals. Commission growth was fastest for our proprietary traders, while net interest income growth was led by individuals followed by financial advisers. At the Company level, we experienced another productive quarter. On August 1, the previously announced merger of IB Central Europe and IB Ireland was completed. As a result, all of our EEA clients can benefit equally from an expanded offering of products and services. The upfront cost of this consolidation was $12 million, which is reflected in our G&A expense. Going forward, assuming today's level of business and regulatory fees, we expect annual savings of $7 million from having only one European brokerage business and one regulator to report to. On September 1, we opened a licensed office in Dubai, solidifying our presence in the Middle East region. We launched trading in both equities and futures on Bursa Malaysia this quarter. We've expanded our offerings to include 22-hour-a-day trading in U.S. treasuries, European government bonds, U.K. Gilts and Swiss franc-denominated corporate and sovereign bonds. In addition to over 10,000 U.S. stocks, ETFs and equity index options, non-U.S. clients can now also trade contracts or difference or CFDs on more than 3,500 U.S. stocks and ETFs during overnight hours. We upgraded our API functionality to provide new introducing broker clients with faster and easier integration. Rather than relying on multiple separate code libraries, our partners can now access our extensive range of services through a single unified interface. In our IBKR ATS, for several years now, we have operated an options crossing session in which we seek opposite side liquidity for marketable orders in U.S. options, providing customers the opportunity for price improvement. We have now added the same functionality for customer U.S. options orders priced inside the NBBO. When we succeed in pairing these tweener orders, liquidity in our ATS, the customer benefit by obtaining a guaranteed fill on their nonmarketable order as well as the opportunity for further price improvement in an on-exchange price improvement auction. We have seen excellent participation by our liquidity providers in this program and our customers who place nonmarketable orders in U.S. listed options are seeing substantial meaningful benefits as a result. We believe this further demonstrates and enhances our position as the premier broker for options trading. And finally, we launched ForecastEx, our forecast contract exchange on August 1. After a 2.5-year approval process, we received the green light from the CFTC and are looking forward to seeing its performance. Investors can now buy yes and no contracts on the outcome of events that were previously unavailable for direct investment or hedging, whether it's the release of key economic data, results of U.S. elections, or long-term developments like future global temperatures or the size of the U.S. national debt, investors can manage exposure or hedge their existing positions. And to ensure it is easy for interested liquidity providers to connect with us, we have both fixed and restful API connectivity ready for them. Together with the Interactive Brokers team, I look forward to continuing the work on the many projects we have lined up, much as planned for the quarters ahead. Our pipeline of new business and new initiatives remains healthy, and we look forward to sharing the results with you as we introduce them. With that, I will turn the call over to Paul Brody. Paul? Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thanks again, and we will talk to you next quarter end."

            "content": "Thank you, Nancy. Thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. We'll start with our revenue items on Page 3 of the release. We're pleased with our financial results this quarter as we again produced record net revenues and pretax income. Commissions rose to a record $435 million. This quarter, both options and futures volumes reached new quarterly highs as we sell active customers across global regions participated in the markets. Net interest income also reached a quarterly record of $802 million despite rate cuts in several countries including the full impact of second quarter cuts in Europe, Canada and Switzerland and partial quarter impact of third quarter cuts in those countries as well as in the U.S., U.K. and Hong Kong. The continued risk on environment in the quarter led to a significant increase in margin borrowing and strong account growth led to increases in our segregated cash portfolio. These increases were partially offset by the interest paid to our customers on their cash balances. Interactive Brokers pays clients holding U.S. dollars, the benchmark Fed funds rate less 50 basis points on their qualified funds which makes us attractive compared to other brokers and banks and competitive with money market funds. And as a truly global broker, we pay similarly competitive rates on qualified balances in 20 other currencies. Other fees and services generated $72 million, up 38% from the prior year driven by the continued risk on positioning of customers, which is reflected in an increase in the risk exposure fees with contributions also from payments for order flow from options exchange mandated programs and FDIC sweep fees as well. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Note that several of these are noncore items and therefore, are excluded in our adjusted earnings. Without these excluded items, other income was an $18 million gain for the quarter. Turning to expenses. Execution, clearing and distribution costs were $116 million in the quarter, up 18% over the year ago quarter, predominantly from higher regulatory fees that were introduced by the SEC earlier this year. The SEC fee is a pass-through to customers, so it does not impact our profitability. As a percent of commission revenues, execution and clearing costs, were 21% in the third quarter for a gross transactional profit margin of 79%. We calculate this by excluding from execution, clearing and distribution, $21 million of non-transaction-based costs mainly market data fees, which do not have a direct commission revenue component. Compensation and benefits expense was $145 million for the quarter for a ratio of compensation expense to adjusted net revenues of 11%, similar to last year's quarter. We remain focused on defense discipline while targeting specific functions to grow the business. Inside our year-over-year staff increase of only 1%, we had good success in hiring talented software developers. And partially offsetting that, we reduced compliance staff as we went into full operational mode with our in-house developed compliance system. Our headcount at September 30th was 2,969. G&A expenses were $75 million, up from the year ago quarter, led by a onetime expense to consolidate our European operations and expenses related to legal and regulatory matters. Excluding these items, G&A was up $9 million to $51 million, primarily on higher advertising expense. Our pretax margin was 72% for the quarter, both as reported and as adjusted. Income taxes of $80 million reflects the sum of the public company's $45 million and the operating company's $35 million. The public company's effective tax rate was 18.4%, within its usual range. Moving to our balance sheet on Page 5 of the release. Our total assets ended the quarter 23% higher than the prior year quarter at $148 billion, driven by strong growth in margin lending. New account growth also helped propel our customer credit balances by 19% to a new record level. And we believe that our strong financial standing and competitive interest rates provide customers with an attractive place to hold their idle cash. We continue to have no long-term debt and healthy profitability drove our 21% increase in firm equity over the prior year quarter. And in recognition of this growth, we allocated capital to a dividend increase last quarter. We maintained a balance sheet geared towards supporting growth in our existing business, and helping us win new business by demonstrating our strength to prospective clients and partners. In our operating data on Pages 6 and 7, we had record customer contract volume in both options and futures. And options and our contract volumes rose 35% over the prior year quarter, well above industry growth. And futures contract volumes rose by 13%. Stock share volumes rose by 22%, also above industry growth. Stock share volume generally increased versus last year as clients in our largest markets, gravitated to larger, higher-quality names and trading relatively less in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks. Growth in the notional dollar value of shares traded well outpaced the growth in share volumes. On Page 7, you can see that total customer DARTs were 2.7 million trades per day, up 42% from the prior year. Commission per cleared commissionable order of $2.83 was down from last year, primarily due to smaller average order sizes across product classes, which is more than compensated by stronger volumes. Turning to net interest income on Page 8. Total GAAP net interest income was $802 million for the quarter, up 9% on the prior year, while our NIM net interest income was $826 million or $24 million higher. In the NIM computation, we include some income that is classified as other fees or other income on our income statement but we believe is more appropriately considered interest. Our net interest income reflects strength in margin loan and segregated cash interest, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. Several central banks made cuts to their benchmark rates this quarter, the U.S., U.K. and Hong Kong cut for the first time since early 2020, while Europe, Switzerland and Canada cut their rates both this quarter and last. Reflecting relatively flat benchmark rates year-on-year, our segregated cash interest income rose 5% on a 6% increase in average balances, while margin loan interest rose by 26% on a 28% increase in average balances. The average duration of our U.S. treasury portfolio remains at less than 30 days. With the U.S. dollar yield curve continuing to be inverted except in the very near term. We have been maximizing what we earn by focusing on higher short-term yields rather than accept the significantly lower yields of longer maturities. This strategy allows us to maintain a relatively tight maturity match between our assets and liabilities and positions us to be nimble if the yield curve does revert. Securities lending net interest has not been as strong as in prior quarters for three main reasons. First, an extremely strong stock market with a backdrop of a falling rate environment, coincides with a smaller proportion of clients looking to put on shorts. Second, there are fewer hard-to-borrow names industry-wide, not only because the overall market is rising sharply, but also due to the weakness in some of the drivers relevant to securities lending, including IPOs, low market volatility and merger and acquisition activity. So even though the notional value of what we are lending was higher than last year's quarter, overall industry average lending rates are lower. Finally, as noted on previous calls, higher average interest rates versus prior year periods means more of what we earn from securities lending is classified as interest on segregated cash. To more accurately reflect all the income, we earn from our securities lending business, we estimate that if the additional interest earned and paid on cash collateral were included under securities borrowed and loan, then total net revenue related to our securities lending business would have been about $156 million versus $181 million in the year ago quarter. This additional revenue would be reclassified from the line items, interest earned on segregated cash and interest paid on customer credit balances. So overall, it would have no effect on our net interest margin. Interest on customer credit balances, the interest we pay to our customers on the cash and their accounts rose on higher balances from new account growth. As we have noted in the past, the high interest rates we pay on customer cash, currently 4.33% on qualified U.S. dollar balances is a significant attraction to new customers. Fully rate-sensitive customer balances were $19.5 billion this quarter versus $17.1 billion in the year ago quarter. Together with firm equity, most of which consists of interest-earning assets, total fully rate-sensitive balances were $33.6 billion. Now for our estimates of the impact of changes in rates. Given market expectations of further rate cuts in the future, we estimate the effect of a 25 basis point decrease in the benchmark Fed funds rate to be a $64 million reduction in annual net interest income. Note that our starting point for this estimate is September 30 with the Fed funds effective rate at 4.83% and balances as of that date. Any growth in our balance sheet and interest-earning assets would reduce this impact. About 24% of our customer cash balances is not in U.S. dollars. So estimates of the U.S. rate change exclude those currencies. We estimate the effect of decreases in all of the relevant non-U.S. benchmark rates, which reduced annual net interest income by $18 million for each 25 basis point decrease in those benchmarks. At a high level, a full 1% decrease in all benchmark rates will decrease our annual net interest income by $328 million. This takes into account rate-sensitive customer balances and firm equity. In conclusion, we posted another financially strong quarter in net revenues and pretax margin reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base and deliver on our core value proposition to customers while scaling the business. Our business strategy continues to be effective. Automating as much of the brokerage business as possible, continuously improving and expanding what we offer while minimizing what we charge. With that, we will open up the line for questions. Well, it was more of a general comment that new accounts always bring more cash. I don't think that we're seeing -- there's a distinction in the character of those accounts. That's -- if there's something illuminating there, it's which client segment at what rate they're growing and we said individuals are growing the fastest, followed by the advisers and the introducing brokers. So... And they certainly generate more volume. I think Milan can address the marketing and advertising perhaps. On the rest, we try to point out the onetime expenses so that they can be dropped out when giving you a better picture of the run rate, but nothing else extraordinary. We'll, yes. So that's -- every quarter, we make an evaluation of open cases and so forth, and we have to make -- we make reserves accordingly, when we can determine that they're probable and estimable. So, it's not out of the ordinary, but it was large enough to make an impact on the overall G&A. We also usually see securities lending opportunities go up around those IPOs and we make those available as well."

And when it will reach scale, I think it will scale later this year. Namely in the last few days of the election, we expect that it will really pick up. We have some other interest coming in to forecast. And so, that's where we are with it. We're extremely excited about it. And the election -- we look at the election thing as a very lucky circumstance because there is so much interest on it, that it will draw in other people who then will be customers for the economic and climate contracts. And that is what is really going to be our long-term focus with ForecastEx. The economic indicators in the climate contracts. The elections are just [indiscernible] interlude. Prop traders are the second most lucrative segment. And we do have more and more prop traders coming in, and they are the ones that have more cash in the account -- in the account and individual trader certainly. So, we are not currently able to activate this for European or British customers, and we are also not able to onboard Canadian customers at this time. But we are -- with the regulators in all these places, and we're trying to get them not necessarily for the election contracts. But for the regular economic indicator and climate indicator contract. And we are, of course, hoping to eventually expand that to sort of social trends. The issue here with this contract is that we need an arbiter that is an uncorruptible arbiter. So namely, it has to be a state-regulated agency that publishes the results. So, nobody can claim that the results are manipulated or something like that. Well, to the extent, if I get some large bidders, I may offer them stock. But I'm not about to go and sell into the market because when the news since the market, the stock tanks. I'm not getting the price I'd like to get."

        "content": "(Transcript provided to Seeking Alpha by the company.):\nOperator: Hello and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Interactive Brokers Group Second Quarter 2024 earnings call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Nancy Stuebe. You may begin.\nNancy Stuebe: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our Second Quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us today are Thomas Peterffy, our Founder and Chairman; Milan Galik, our President and CEO; and Paul Brody, our CFO. I will be presenting Milan\u2019s comments on the business, and all three will be available on the Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. This quarter, world markets began to move in divergent ways as stock markets, central banks and geopolitical crosscurrents played out. The S&P 500 rose this quarter, while other previously strong markets, such as Europe, Canada, Japan, China and Australia, all declined after positive first quarter market results. Further differences were seen on the central bank front, as the US Federal Reserve chose to maintain benchmark rates this quarter, while in other developed countries \u2013 like Canada, Europe and Switzerland \u2013 central banks started to cut rates, beginning with 25 basis points. One ongoing fact that has not changed, however, is the popularity of investing, with global interest from investors who increasingly want broad portfolios and international access. The secular global investment trend remains that investors allocate some of their portfolio to securities in their home markets, but a more significant portion to overseas securities, particularly in the US. Product-wise, industry options contract volumes were ahead of last year, though down against a blistering, industry-record first quarter. Similar to options, CME futures volumes, though up 14% versus last year, were down 2% in the quarter for the industry, primarily on investors trading less actively using interest rate futures on the direction of interest rates, than they had in the first quarter. On the equities front, US industry volumes, though up versus last year, were down a fraction of a percent in the quarter. In equities, the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d once again were the main drivers of US market performance, contributing nearly all of the S&P\u2019s gain this quarter, and with just two stocks \u2013 Nvidia and Apple \u2013 responsible for \u00be of that. As in prior recent quarters, we see investors holding onto their positions and not looking to make changes like selling them and buying new names. Industry equities volumes were flat to down again as a result. Against this backdrop, all our volumes were up for both the quarter and the year, as our clients remained active in all product categories. The continuing trend towards global investing across countries and product type, by all kinds of clients, continues to show up in our numbers. We saw strong account growth as we added more investors to our platform, both institutional and individual, across all geographies. We added 178,000 new accounts this quarter, behind only the meme stock days of the first quarter 2021 and the first quarter of this year. New accounts meant more cash in those accounts, which helped raise our client credit balances to a record $107.1 billion, even as our volumes show that our clients put their money to work in the markets. Our client equity was up 36% over last year to $497 billion, which was just shy of half a trillion dollars in total client assets, a figure we ended up exceeding this month. Rising equity markets and the anticipation of lower rates have led clients to feel more comfortable with taking on risk, so they took on more assertive positions, which increased our exposure fee revenue; and took on more leverage to bolster their positions, increasing both our margin loans \u2013 which reached a record $55 billion this quarter - and our margin interest income. All of which translated into strong financial results. Commission revenue was second only to the meme-stock spike of the first quarter of 2021, and net interest income reached a record, as did total net revenues. We maintained our focus on expenses, meaning our pretax income also reached a record, and our reported pretax profit margin reached at an industry-leading 72%, with adjusted pretax margin of 73%. In terms of how the business looked on the client front, our accounts and client equity once again grew fastest in Europe and Asia, similar to what I mentioned earlier - growing numbers of investors worldwide wanting access to international, and particularly US markets. Of our five client segments, the fastest account growth was seen with Individuals, with introducing brokers and proprietary traders not far behind. On the client equity side, financial advisors once again grew the fastest, followed by i-brokers and individuals. Commission growth was fastest for our Proprietary traders, while net interest income growth was led by hedge funds, followed by introducing brokers and individuals. Speaking of introducing brokers, our pipeline of potential clients remains healthy. We were pleased that HSBC publicly announced their HSBC WorldTrader offering, powered by Interactive Brokers, in June. There are several other opportunities\u2014 about a couple dozen of them - at various stages. Some are in the testing stage; others have started onboarding so-called \u201cFriends and Family accounts\u201d, where they test the waters and make sure that everything is working; while others are in the prospect stage to figure out the optimal way for them to interface with us. As we\u2019ve mentioned and as bears repeating, this can take time, since we offer a variety of ways for an introducing broker to come onto our platform, some quicker than others, and all dependent on what the broker wants. So while we expect growth to continue in this area, predicting the timing of it is not something we can do. In terms of new product introductions, we had a busy quarter. We strengthened our ATS by adding new liquidity providers and order types. Each quarter we are executing more trades on our ATS, connecting our client orders with liquidity providers and helping them save on execution costs. IBKR Trader Workstation remains our premier product for professional clients, yet we understand that different client types have different needs: we see that many Financial Advisors find their needs met by our more streamlined, targeted web platform. The IBKR Financial Advisor Portal has been enhanced with a new Portfolio summary screen and a specialized Order Allocation Tool. Further, our PortfolioAnalyst online performance analysis tool added a Retirement Planner for FAs, as well as for individuals and introducing brokers, to better serve our clients\u2019 long-term plans. We added several trading venues, including Korean derivatives trading on Eurex, CBOE European derivatives, and overnight trading in US corporate and government bonds. We launched securities lending for Swedish stocks, made our crypto offering available in the UK, and launched recurring investment in Canada. We also introduced Conditional Orders on our mobile platform, a much-requested feature that can be set to initiate or cancel an order based on a variety of triggers. Auto-FX is now the default setting for clients with cash accounts wishing to trade securities in a currency different from their account's. With Auto-FX, clients can place an order for a security without manually performing a foreign currency conversion. We handle the FX transaction automatically. Although we are not the only broker offering this feature, IBKR's implementation offers significant advantages for cost-conscious and active traders: First, we only charge 3 bps, compared to up to a full percent by our competitors. And second, we charge only if a trade that a client makes results in a negative currency balance. This means that clients who trade multiple times daily can significantly reduce their costs because IBKR does not charge FX conversion on every trade, while other brokers do. Our High Touch Prime Brokerage Service, which we announced last quarter, has also gotten off to a good start. Clients benefiting from this service have commented that they have an easier time interfacing with us, and appreciate having their own point person and specialized attention to their particular issues. As one of our new High Touch clients said, \u201cthis service makes the decision to disregard pitches from other prime brokers easier.\u201d We are considering other improvements to make our prime brokerage offering even more compelling. I look forward to continuing the work on the many projects we have lined up. Much is planned for the rest of 2024 and beyond which we are eager to develop, test, and introduce. We have a healthy pipeline of new business and new initiatives, and are eager to share these with you as they come to fruition. With that, I will turn the call over to Paul Brody. Paul?\nPaul Brody: Thank you, Nancy, and welcome everyone to the call. Thanks for joining. Starting with our Revenue items on page 3 of the release, we are pleased with our financial results this quarter, as we again produced record net revenues and pretax income. Commissions rose versus last year\u2019s 2nd quarter, reaching $406 million, second only to that of the pandemic-era first quarter of 2021. This quarter, we saw higher trading volumes from our growing base of active customers, with options setting a new quarterly volume record and futures reaching their second highest volumes ever. Net interest income also reached a quarterly record of $792 million, despite only modestly higher benchmark rates in most major currencies and a recent taste of rate cuts in a few others. A more pronounced risk-on environment in the quarter led to a significant increase in margin borrowing, and higher yields on our margin loans and segregated cash portfolio on a year-over-year basis provided tailwinds to these results. These increases were partially offset by the higher interest paid to our customers on their cash balances. Interactive Brokers passes through to them all rate hikes above the first 50 basis points on their qualified funds, which makes us attractive compared to other brokers and banks, and competitive with money market funds. Other fees and services generated $68 million, up 45% from the prior year, driven by the risk-on positioning of customers in the quarter. As we report in the Financial Highlights on page 1 of our earnings release, the primary factor was an increase in risk exposure fees, with contributions from payments for order flow from exchange-mandated programs and FDIC sweep fees as well. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings. Without these excluded items, Other income was a $24 million gain for the quarter. Turning to expenses, Execution, Clearing and Distribution costs were $115 million in the quarter, up 24% over the year-ago quarter predominantly from a $9 million increase in the SEC regulatory fee rate that began on May 22nd, and on higher volumes in options and futures, which carry higher fees. The SEC fee is a pass-through to customers, so it does not impact our profitability. As a percent of commission revenues, Execution & Clearing costs were 23% in the 2nd quarter for a Gross Transactional Profit margin of 77%. We calculate this by excluding from \"Execution, Clearing and Distribution\u201d $20 million of non-transaction-based costs, predominantly market data fees, which do not have a direct commission revenue component. Compensation & Benefits expense was $146 million for the quarter, for a ratio of Compensation expense to Adjusted Net Revenues of 11%, down from 13% in last year\u2019s quarter. We remain focused on expense discipline, as reflected in our slowing the staff increase to 1% over the prior year. The year-over-year increase included a decrease in Compliance staff, as we went into full operational mode with our in-house developed Compliance system, offset by increases in client-facing and software development roles. Our headcount at June 30th was 2,951. G&A expenses were $52 million, down from the year-ago quarter. Without last year\u2019s unusual legal reserve, G&A was up 33%, or $13 million, primarily on higher advertising and, partly, on legal expenses. Our pretax margin was 72% for the quarter as reported, and 73% as adjusted. Income Taxes of $71 million reflects the sum of the public company\u2019s $36 million and the operating companies\u2019 $35 million. The public company\u2019s adjusted effective tax rate was 16.5%, slightly below its usual range. Moving to our balance sheet on page 5 of the Release, our total assets ended the quarter 13% higher than the prior year quarter-end at $137 billion, with growth driven by margin lending to both new and existing customers. New account growth also helped drive our record customer credit balances. And we believe that our strong financial standing and competitive interest rates provide customers with an attractive place to hold their idle cash. We continue to have no long-term debt. Healthy profitability drove our 20% increase in firm equity over the prior year. We maintain a balance sheet geared towards supporting growth in our existing business and helping us win new business by demonstrating our strength to prospective clients and partners. In our operating data, on pages 6 and 7, our customer contract volumes in options rose 35% over the prior-year quarter, well above industry growth, and reached a new record high for IBKR. Futures contract volumes rose by 10%, reflecting our second highest volume ever; and stock share volumes rose by 26%, as they did across the industry. Stock share volume generally increased in tandem with clients gravitating to larger, higher quality names, with relatively lower trading in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks, in our largest markets. On page 7, you can see that total Customer DARTs were 2.4 million trades per day, up 28% from the prior year and especially strong in options, followed by stocks and futures. Commission per Cleared Commissionable Order of $3.01 was down from last year, due to a mix of smaller average order sizes in stocks and futures and lower average commission per contract in options. Volume and aggregate commissions were higher in all product classes, but the specific contracts traded by our customers have different size and commission characteristics. Page 8 shows our Net Interest Margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income was $792 million for the quarter, up 14% on the prior year, while our NIM net interest income was $805 million, or $13 million higher. In the NIM computation, we include some income that for GAAP purposes is classified as Other Fees or Other Income, but we believe is more appropriately considered interest. Our Net Interest Income reflects strength in margin loan and segregated cash interest, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. Only recently, a few central banks made 25 basis point cuts to their benchmark rates, including Europe and Canada; Switzerland cut its rate both this quarter and last. Others, including the Federal Reserve, held interest rates steady. Reflecting a modest rise in benchmark rates over the year, our segregated cash interest income rose 6% despite a 2% decrease in average balances, while margin loan interest rose by 38% on a 31% increase in average balances. The average duration of our US Treasury portfolio remained at about 30 days. With the US dollar yield curve continuing to be inverted, we have been maximizing what we earn by focusing on higher short-term yields, rather than accept the significantly lower yields of longer maturities. This strategy allows us to maintain a relatively tight maturity match between our assets and liabilities. Securities lending net interest has not been as strong as in prior quarters for three main reasons: First, throughout the industry, overall demand for shorting stocks has fallen. An extremely strong stock market, up in the US well over 20% in the past year, means fewer people are looking to put on shorts when the overall market trend is so soundly upward. Second, there are fewer \u201chard to borrow\u201d names industry-wide, not only because the overall market is rising sharply, but also due to weakness in some of the drivers relevant to securities lending, including significantly fewer IPOs, low market volatility, and static merger & acquisition activity. Finally, as noted on previous calls, higher average interest rates versus prior year periods means more of what we earn from securities lending is classified as interest on \u201csegregated cash\u201d. To more accurately reflect all the income we earn from our securities lending business, we estimate that if the additional interest earned and paid on cash collateral were included under \u201cSecurities Borrowed and Loaned\u201d, then total net revenue related to our securities lending business would have been about $194 million for the quarter; versus $190 million in the year-ago quarter; and $167 million in the first quarter of 2024. This additional revenue would be reclassified from interest on segregated cash and interest paid on customer credit balances, so it would have no effect on our overall NIM. Interest on Customer Credit Balances, the interest we pay to our customers on the cash in their accounts, rose on both higher rates in many currencies versus last year, and higher balances from new account growth. As we have noted in the past, the high interest rates we pay on customer cash \u2013 currently 4.83% on qualified US dollar balances - is a significant driver of new customers. Fully rate-sensitive customer balances were about $18.6 billion this quarter, versus $17.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. Together with firm equity, most of which consists of interest-earning assets, total fully rate-sensitive balances were approximately $30.7 billion. Now, for our estimates of the impact of changes in rates. Given market expectations of rate cuts sometime in 2024, we estimate the effect of a 25-basis point decrease in the benchmark Fed Funds rate to be a $59 million reduction in annual net interest income. Note that our starting point for this estimate is June 30th, with the Fed Funds effective rate at 5.33%, and balances as of that date. Any growth in our balance sheet and interest-earning assets would reduce this impact. About 25% of our customer cash balances is not in US dollars, so estimates of a US rate change exclude those currencies. We estimate the effect of decreases in all the relevant non-USD benchmark rates would reduce annual net interest income by $18 million for each 25-basis point decrease in those benchmarks. At a high level, a full 1% decrease in all benchmark rates would decrease our annual net interest income by $307 million. This takes into account rate-sensitive customer balances and firm equity. In conclusion, we posted another financially strong quarter in net revenues and pretax margin, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base and deliver on our core value proposition to customers while scaling the business. Our business strategy continues to be effective: Automating as much of the brokerage business as possible, continuously improving and expanding what we offer while minimizing what we charge. With that, we will now open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ben Budish from Barclays.\nBen Budish: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could unpack the year-to-date account growth a little bit more. You gave some color on the faster-growing customer segments, but in terms of individuals, can you maybe talk a little bit about what the average customer looks like? How do they compare to the back book of customers? It sounds like they're bringing over ample new cash while still deploying into the markets. So just curious if you could talk about the average size, what the activity levels are like. And then maybe, similarly on the hedge fund side, talk a little bit about your progress there and what your expectations are over the rest of the year and into \u201825?\nMilan Galik: Thank you for your question. So usually, the new accounts that we get in each quarter, they take a little while to bring on all the assets that they intended to bring. So it takes a little while for us to see the entire impact. But what can give you some idea is the fact that the new accounts went up by 28%, commissions by 11%, net interest income by 18%, DARTs by 28%, and the assets by 36%. So if you look at the S&P 500 year-over-year is up 23%, QQQ is up by 29%. So if you look at all these numbers together, that will give you some idea as to how much in assets, how much cash they brought.\nBen Budish: Thanks. That's helpful. If I could ask a follow-up. Just on a comment you made, Paul, I think you mentioned something about $18.6 billion of rate-sensitive cash, but total fully rate-sensitive balances were a little over $30 billion. Could you clarify what you meant there, the difference between the two?\nPaul Brody: The rest is rate-sensitive firm equity. So our equity is $15 billion plus, of which certain amount of it is sensitive to interest rates. And that makes up the rest.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you and good evening, everyone. And congrats on the first HSBC launch in the UAE, so let me just start there. I had a mechanical question on the launch. When this white-labeled offering is launched in a specific region, are you replacing an existing HSBC offering so there's a large inflow of client equity and client cash with a large number of accounts on day one? Or is it smaller, with the product being cross sold to existing clients with a longer ramp process?\nMilan Galik: The answer for the UAE is that we are going to be onboarding their existing business from Pershing. The migration should be happening sometime in August, if everything goes well. We're talking approximately around 10,000 accounts. The other countries that HSBC is going to be onboarding with us, they do not result in immediate inflow of new accounts. HSBC, as you know, has significant banking presence in a lot of countries and their vision is to offer, to those banking clients, Interactive Brokers-powered platform. So these are greenfield businesses. So 10,000 coming from the UAE existing migration, and then going up gradually. Other countries going gradually, up from zero.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Milan. Just as my follow up on the same topic. Nancy referenced that there's a couple of dozen regions that are currently testing or onboarding \u201cFriends and Family.\u201d I was curious, what percentage of the total accounts that you expect to win? Does this first batch that includes the couple of dozen regions represent? Or does this couple dozen regions, is that the total account package that you expect to win through this HSBC relationship?\nMilan Galik: Nancy was talking about the couple of dozen introducing broker prospects and she explained how they are all in various stages. It's probably a handful, maybe a little more are prospects, then some have already opened accounts and are doing connectivity tests, others are in this \u201cFriends and Employees\u201d stage. I would expect us to win most of the prospects. We have been normally very successful in winning them. The conversations that we have progressed well. They\u2019re typically about the methodology that is going to be used to onboard them\u2014 are they going to be fully disclosed or one-way disclosed, is it going to be an omnibus. So the ones that we count in this funnel, those are already serious conversations. Maybe one or two will not materialize, but most of them will.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of James Yaro with Goldman Sachs.\nJames Yaro: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch on the enhanced offerings for hedge funds. I think in April you announced the High-Touch Prime and global outsourced trading. Maybe you could just touch on how those initiatives have gone, the early readings from that? Has it accelerated your growth rate with hedge funds so far? And then when you talk about other enhancements to your prime brokerage offering, would these be more high touch offerings, or would they be tech-enabled, or mix of both? And should we think about any ramifications from those to your margins?\nMilan Galik: So the enhancement was very well received. We have onboarded approximately\u2014 exactly 30 hedge funds onto this white glove enhanced service. The feedback is good. The hedge funds really enjoy having a point person that they can talk to. They get access to various experts within our organization through this single point of contact. So they really do like the experience. We cannot see any change in the numbers, and we did not expect to see one. You may recall that the reason why we did this was to increase the likelihood that the hedge funds as they cross the $100 million threshold, which seems to be the magical number when the large primes become interested in them, we wanted to increase the likelihood that they would stay with us. So time will tell whether this was a good bet; I'm hopeful that it was. As to further enhancements, we continue the discussions with the hedge funds. Obviously, the order desk is online. It's a global order desk: we take orders from the hedge funds, so that they do not have to sit at their desks and maybe execute orders in the middle of the night. There are still discussions about capital introduction. We have had our own capital introduction program online for a long time. There is demand, or there are requests, for us to make improvements to it. That is the current state.\nJames Yaro: Okay, great. That's very, very clear. Maybe just one other as a follow-up related to hedge funds. I think prime brokerage net leverage at the very largest banks is up substantially. But securities lending for you and certain other retail-skewed brokers has remained fairly soft. Just any views on perhaps why there is that dichotomy? Is it that retail short selling activity is light, whereas large hedge funds are perhaps adding to shorts? And maybe if you don't have a view on that one, maybe just when you look at your hedge fund business\u2014 your prime brokerage business, has there been increased short selling activity for those clients?\nMilan Galik: Well, I do not personally look at this as broken down. Maybe Paul has some color that he can share with you. What I can tell you is that the hedge funds on our platform increased their leverage. They borrowed a larger amount of money from us and that is partially the reason why the net interest income is up and obviously the balances increased to $55 billion this quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDaniel Fannon: Hi thanks. Good afternoon. Just another question on the backlog with the introducing brokers\u2014the couple of dozen that was cited. I guess, how would that compare to say a year ago? And then generally, who are you competing with to win this business? Is it just internal offerings or are there other peers that you are typically going up against?\nMilan Galik: The pipeline looks pretty much the same size. I think a year ago it was roughly the same number. As to whom we are competing with, well, our offering is very unique. As you know, we cover the world in terms of access to the exchanges in various countries. So the introducing brokers or introducing broker prospects, they like that. They like the fact that we can offer them access to local markets, to regional markets, to overseas, and especially United States. There are some competitors in this space, especially in Asia and in Europe. Those are our competitors. Those are the firms that we compete with.\nDaniel Fannon: Okay, that's helpful. And then a couple of quarters ago, Thomas talked about declining interest rates maybe being pro-growth of your business in terms of utilization of things like margin and account growth and trading. But given the run we've had this year in the market, the growth in accounts, growth in margin balances, does that view still hold if we do get some Fed cuts going forward or have we maybe overshot here in the context of how your client base is performing currently?\nMilan Galik: It's difficult to tell what will happen. What I can tell you is that if the Fed lowers the interest rate by 25 basis points as is widely expected at this point, our annual net interest income will decrease by $77 million. So that is going to be the impact. The lower interest rates obviously spur economic growth, but there is going to be a lot of uncertainty. We still have two wars that are in the Middle East and in Europe. There is election season. We are going to have a new administration. There is a lot of uncertainty as to how that is going to play out or what exactly that's going to mean. Even if the Trump ticket wins the election, it's unclear exactly what the impact is going to be, because there is chatter about increased tariffs which can in turn increase inflation. So there is a lot of uncertainty out there. Uncertainty usually results in volatility and higher trading volumes, as customers want to put on risky positions or they want to do hedges or sell out their winners. So it's really difficult to tell, but I do not see a good reason to believe that the trading activity will dramatically slow down.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good morning\u2014 sorry, good evening. First one just on ForecastEx. I know that received CFTC approval last month, but I think there were some subsequent press around saying the launch may be delayed. Just wondering, any update on the timing of a launch there? And then maybe just speak about the opportunity you see for forecast contracts more broadly and size and opportunity a bit for us.\nMilan Galik: So yes, there is a slight delay. We realized that there is a little bit more work that we need to do, bookkeeping work that has to do with booking of swaps. That is the license that the CFTC granted to ForecastEx, so there is a bit more work that we need to do. We're hoping to launch in the middle of August. As to the opportunity, we are hopeful that a similar thing is going to happen as what we witnessed in the area of security\u2014 equity options. Remember, when it started back 40 or more years ago, it was something brand new. And today it is a really, really big industry\u2014 betting on economic indicators, on climate events, in general, events that can affect the performance of your portfolio and events that our customers may want to hedge themselves against. We believe that is going to become over time, a very popular and growing area.\nKyle Voigt: Great. Thank you for that. And then I just had one follow-up for Paul. Just to be super clear about the new securities lending disclosures that you provided today. So hypothetically, if we retroactively applied a 0% benchmark rate globally to the entirety of the second quarter, I just want to know that the securities revenues that you would have reported would have been $194 million instead of $25 million. Is that correct? Or formulaically is that how the pricing methodology would have worked, just would have shifted the bucket into sec lending from seg cash revenue?\nPaul Brody: Yeah. It's a slightly more complicated question. But if you assume zero benchmark, then all of the securities lending trading itself becomes just the borrow fee, which is high for a hard to borrow stock and low for a general collateral stock. Likewise, as we used to have when the rates are almost zero, if we were to lend a stock, taking the cash collateral and then reinvest the cash collateral in a very low interest rate environment, that cash collateral earns very little. So one of the reasons why we have decided to offer this presentation is because it didn't make any difference when the rates were near zero\u2014it didn't make much difference. But now the rates are 5% plus, it's more helpful to see all sides of the equation that are related to securities lending, right? The simplest example being we lend a customer stock. We take in the cash collateral. Now when we reinvest it, it's at more like 5.4%, and that obviously plays a role. Up until now, we have been and\u2014 in our net interest margin presentation that shows up in segregated cash and securities. But one could think of it as being related to securities lending. And so all we're talking about here is reclassifying that just from a management perspective. It's a different way to look at it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler.\nPatrick Moley: Yes, hello. Thanks for taking the question. So I had one on options. Options volumes for you were up 36% year over year in the second quarter, I think. Can you just speak through the growth you're seeing there and maybe break it out and help us understand, looking across geographies where that growth is coming from? And I think Thomas has spoken in the past about expecting higher derivatives volume growth overseas. How big of a driver do you think that can be for your business and what kind of advantage you think you have over some of your publicly traded peers here in the US who have recently spoke about being more deliberate with their efforts overseas.\nMilan Galik: So obviously, the zero day to expiration option, that is where a lot of volume has been happening. And weekly options, that's where a lot of volume was taking place. As far as the zero-day options, it\u2019s the cash-settled index options. We had seen Eurex adding shorter term options and I think other exchanges will follow. So this phenomenon is going to increase in other regions, not only in the United States. As far as geography, it is the US option volumes that are dominant, there is obviously trading in Asia and Europe, but the US still dominates. Even our foreign overseas investors gravitate towards these instruments. It is to some extent the job of the regional exchanges to make the contracts popular and increase the offering and the volumes. But our technology is there, we have the connectivity, we have the access to the clients, so we are making them available to the clients. I guess that is how I would answer your question. You asked about what the advantages are. So our platform is originally designed for professional and active traders. The platform is superb, it delivers results. The very active traders on our platform attest to it. We have since then implemented very good screens on the mobile trader as well as on the web platform. So we cover, in terms of the platform, the entire spectrum of clientele, from the active trader all the way to the beginner. We have tools that help our clients initiate positions. We have a wizard; we have had the wizard for a very long time. For someone who is not yet accustomed to what the possibilities of options trading are, they can enter their forecast. For example, \u201cBy this date, I expect NVIDIA stock to be up by 10%. What are the trading strategies I could consider?\u201d And the wizard responds with these different choices that the client can then choose from. So I think we're very well positioned to take advantage of the increased popularity of options trading overseas.\nPatrick Moley: All right. That's great color. And then just a quick follow up on the NYSE loss. Can you speak\u2014 was there any impact on the tax rate this quarter from that? And then just looking forward, is there any possibility at all that any of that could be recovered? Thanks.\nMilan Galik: As far as the recovery, the answer is unfortunately, no. We have looked at what can be done. When the mishap took place, we immediately contacted the exchange, and we requested that the purchases at extremely high prices be busted\u2014 we asked that those trades be busted. Unfortunately, the industry rules are written in such a way that the New York Stock Exchange was not able to bust those trades. And we have also pursued the opportunity to ask for a compensation payment under the Rule 18. Rule 18 has also very significant limitations including how much can be paid in terms of compensation. We looked at other avenues. We have decided that we are very unlikely to be successful in recovering the money that we have lost here. What we are going to do is, we are going to be proposing changes to how such events should be handled in the future. Because it is our strong belief that not only the New York Stock Exchange, but also the lead market maker, the specialist handling the Berkshire Hathaway, did not do an adequate job here and some rule changes need to be done. And we are in the process of writing a letter to the SEC proposing very concrete modifications to the rules that would benefit not only us, but the entire industry. And when the letter is written, we will post it on our website. As far as the tax implications. Paul maybe you can reply to that one.\nPaul Brody: Yes. Could you repeat the question on the taxes?\nPatrick Moley: Yes. Just if there was any tax implications from the loss or anything worth calling out this quarter going forward?\nPaul Brody: It just flows into gains and losses. And so there's nothing about it that would not be taxable as a general expense, it is. And there were no other real notable items. Every quarter, there are some tax items that may not apply directly to the current quarter like tax credits, things like that. So these come and go, that primarily is what causes minor fluctuations in our overall effective tax rate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Macraes Sykes with GAMCO.\nMacrae Sykes: Oh great. Thank you. I have two questions about the IBDs, and I'll just ask them together. I was wondering if you could kind of give us an update on the TAM around the IBDs, whether you know how many IBDs are out there globally, how much they custody? Anything to kind of point to the opportunity there, and I know it's evolving. And then the second thing is with respect to working with these new relationships, is there any difference as you set up a white label operation with an individual company such as HSBC in terms of the costs associated or the economics. So is there a difference between handling a 10,000 account IBD or with one that's 50,000? And just are there any dis-synergies with your platform in terms of having to handle kind of more bespoke operation? Thank you.\nMilan Galik: I believe there are a lot of prospects out there\u2014 introducing broker prospects. There are investment companies, especially banks, that have very large numbers of clients and they are pursuing the opportunity to offer brokerage services to them. Some of them tried to go it alone. Some of them, a small number succeed. Some give up when they realize that the undertaking is greater than they expected, and then they turn to Interactive Brokers and maybe another competitor for help. That is what we see. Another thing that we see is that there are brokers that just start from zero, they realize that there is an opportunity to offer localized service to the clientele in a specific country. They think that they can do a good job advertising, running customer service, and serve the local clientele. That is something that we also see. There is going to continue to be a large number of these, I believe. As to the economics and scalability, that varies. We onboard some introducing brokers as an omnibus account relationship, which means it's the same single account or let's say, up to 10 different accounts because they like to separate it by the residence of the clientele, whether it's a margin account or a cash account. So it's a very small number of accounts, a handful up to 10, covering many thousands of individual accounts on their platform. So that's sort of one extreme. The other extreme is that we carry one specific account per end client, and we have both of these relationships. The economics are different. The omnibus accounts obviously tax our infrastructure much less. We do not have to deal with the KYC and AML of the individual clients. On the other hand, the relationships where we carry sub-accounts for individual clients, the economics are a little better, but which costs us more computing power, and our customer service gets involved to an extent. And we have to deal with the KYC and AML. But we are open to take both and we are usually providing a helping hand to the prospect deciding what type of setup would suit them the best.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Citi.\nChris Allen: Yeah, evening everyone. A little bit of a cleanup question. Just on the NII sensitivity to rate cuts. I believe, Paul, it's a $59 million reduction, but Milan noted it was $77 million. So just wondering which is correct. Maybe $77 million includes all global rates or the $59 million US? Just any color there would be helpful.\nPaul Brody: Yeah, that's exactly right, Chris. So the $59 million is an assumption that only the Fed moves the US dollar rate, and the $77 million it makes a very broad assumption that all currency rates or rates in all currencies are reduced.\nChris Allen: Just a quick one on expenses. Noted the decrease in compliance staff as you went on full operational mode with the new compliance system. Just wondering like how much efficiencies, something like that would generate or realize you're redeploying into other investment areas. But then what are the other incremental opportunities you're working on to reduce inefficiencies moving forward?\nMilan Galik: So if you look at our overall headcount, you'll see that it didn't change compared to a year ago. We are at 2,950 employees. There are small changes as to the individual departments, but we're not talking large numbers. Our goal is to be able to use technology to the maximum extent possible. Ideally, we would be able to onboard new accounts without adding additional staff. We were quite successful I would say in that over the last year, because we did not add any employees and yet we had a very significant growth in the number of accounts, but it won't always be like this. We are very closely monitoring the metrics on the customer service side. We see how long the wait times are. And if they cross a certain threshold, we make a decision to increase the number of customer service representatives, as we have just done. But again, we're not talking large numbers here, we're talking several dozens of new customer service representatives employed in the lower cost countries. So that's the way it is. With the advances in the AI, it should be easier to achieve our goal of scalability without adding new personnel, but it's not easy to do.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Nancy for closing remarks.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will talk to you next quarter end.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Nancy was talking about the couple of dozen introducing broker prospects and she explained how they are all in various stages. It's probably a handful, maybe a little more are prospects, then some have already opened accounts and are doing connectivity tests, others are in this \u201cFriends and Employees\u201d stage. I would expect us to win most of the prospects. We have been normally very successful in winning them. The conversations that we have progressed well.

There are small changes as to the individual departments, but we're not talking large numbers. Our goal is to be able to use technology to the maximum extent possible. Ideally, we would be able to onboard new accounts without adding additional staff. We were quite successful I would say in that over the last year, because we did not add any employees and yet we had a very significant growth in the number of accounts, but it won't always be like this. We are very closely monitoring the metrics on the customer service side. We see how long the wait times are. And if they cross a certain threshold, we make a decision to increase the number of customer service representatives, as we have just done. But again, we're not talking large numbers here, we're talking several dozens of new customer service representatives employed in the lower cost countries. So that's the way it is. With the advances in the AI, it should be easier to achieve our goal of scalability without adding new personnel, but it's not easy to do."

            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our Second Quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us today are Thomas Peterffy, our Founder and Chairman; Milan Galik, our President and CEO; and Paul Brody, our CFO. I will be presenting Milan's comments on the business, and all three will be available on the Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature, are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. This quarter, world markets began to move in divergent ways as stock markets, central banks and geopolitical crosscurrents played out. The S&P 500 rose this quarter, while other previously strong markets, such as Europe, Canada, Japan, China and Australia, all declined after positive first quarter market results. Further differences were seen on the central bank front, as the US Federal Reserve chose to maintain benchmark rates this quarter, while in other developed countries \u2013 like Canada, Europe and Switzerland \u2013 central banks started to cut rates, beginning with 25 basis points. One ongoing fact that has not changed, however, is the popularity of investing, with global interest from investors who increasingly want broad portfolios and international access. The secular global investment trend remains that investors allocate some of their portfolio to securities in their home markets, but a more significant portion to overseas securities, particularly in the US. Product-wise, industry options contract volumes were ahead of last year, though down against a blistering, industry-record first quarter. Similar to options, CME futures volumes, though up 14% versus last year, were down 2% in the quarter for the industry, primarily on investors trading less actively using interest rate futures on the direction of interest rates, than they had in the first quarter. On the equities front, US industry volumes, though up versus last year, were down a fraction of a percent in the quarter. In equities, the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d once again were the main drivers of US market performance, contributing nearly all of the S&P's gain this quarter, and with just two stocks \u2013 Nvidia and Apple \u2013 responsible for 3\u20444 of that. As in prior recent quarters, we see investors holding onto their positions and not looking to make changes like selling them and buying new names. Industry equities volumes were flat to down again as a result. Against this backdrop, all our volumes were up for both the quarter and the year, as our clients remained active in all product categories. The continuing trend towards global investing across countries and product type, by all kinds of clients, continues to show up in our numbers. We saw strong account growth as we added more investors to our platform, both institutional and individual, across all geographies. We added 178,000 new accounts this quarter, behind only the meme stock days of the first quarter 2021 and the first quarter of this year. New accounts meant more cash in those accounts, which helped raise our client credit balances to a record $107.1 billion, even as our volumes show that our clients put their money to work in the markets. Our client equity was up 36% over last year to $497 billion, which was just shy of half a trillion dollars in total client assets, a figure we ended up exceeding this month. Rising equity markets and the anticipation of lower rates have led clients to feel more comfortable with taking on risk, so they took on more assertive positions, which increased our exposure fee revenue; and took on more leverage to bolster their positions, increasing both our margin loans \u2013 which reached a record $55 billion this quarter - and our margin interest income. All of which translated into strong financial results. Commission revenue was second only to the meme-stock spike of the first quarter of 2021, and net interest income reached a record, as did total net revenues. We maintained our focus on expenses, meaning our pretax income also reached a record, and our reported pretax profit margin reached at an industry-leading 72%, with adjusted pretax margin of 73%. In terms of how the business looked on the client front, our accounts and client equity once again grew fastest in Europe and Asia, similar to what I mentioned earlier - growing numbers of investors worldwide wanting access to international, and particularly US markets. Of our five client segments, the fastest account growth was seen with Individuals, with introducing brokers and proprietary traders not far behind. On the client equity side, financial advisors once again grew the fastest, followed by i-brokers and individuals. Commission growth was fastest for our Proprietary traders, while net interest income growth was led by hedge funds, followed by introducing brokers and individuals. Speaking of introducing brokers, our pipeline of potential clients remains healthy. We were pleased that HSBC publicly announced their HSBC WorldTrader offering, powered by Interactive Brokers, in June. There are several other opportunities\u2014 about a couple dozen of them - at various stages. Some are in the testing stage; others have started onboarding so-called \u201cFriends and Family accounts\u201d, where they test the waters and make sure that everything is working; while others are in the prospect stage to figure out the optimal way for them to interface with us. As we've mentioned and as bears repeating, this can take time, since we offer a variety of ways for an introducing broker to come onto our platform, some quicker than others, and all dependent on what the broker wants. So while we expect growth to continue in this area, predicting the timing of it is not something we can do. In terms of new product introductions, we had a busy quarter. We strengthened our ATS by adding new liquidity providers and order types. Each quarter we are executing more trades on our ATS, connecting our client orders with liquidity providers and helping them save on execution costs. IBKR Trader Workstation remains our premier product for professional clients, yet we understand that different client types have different needs: we see that many Financial Advisors find their needs met by our more streamlined, targeted web platform. The IBKR Financial Advisor Portal has been enhanced with a new Portfolio summary screen and a specialized Order Allocation Tool. Further, our PortfolioAnalyst online performance analysis tool added a Retirement Planner for FAs, as well as for individuals and introducing brokers, to better serve our clients' long-term plans. We added several trading venues, including Korean derivatives trading on Eurex, CBOE European derivatives, and overnight trading in US corporate and government bonds. We launched securities lending for Swedish stocks, made our crypto offering available in the UK, and launched recurring investment in Canada. We also introduced Conditional Orders on our mobile platform, a much-requested feature that can be set to initiate or cancel an order based on a variety of triggers. Auto-FX is now the default setting for clients with cash accounts wishing to trade securities in a currency different from their account's. With Auto-FX, clients can place an order for a security without manually performing a foreign currency conversion. We handle the FX transaction automatically. Although we are not the only broker offering this feature, IBKR's implementation offers significant advantages for cost-conscious and active traders: First, we only charge 3 bps, compared to up to a full percent by our competitors. And second, we charge only if a trade that a client makes results in a negative currency balance. This means that clients who trade multiple times daily can significantly reduce their costs because IBKR does not charge FX conversion on every trade, while other brokers do. Our High Touch Prime Brokerage Service, which we announced last quarter, has also gotten off to a good start. Clients benefiting from this service have commented that they have an easier time interfacing with us, and appreciate having their own point person and specialized attention to their particular issues. As one of our new High Touch clients said, \u201cthis service makes the decision to disregard pitches from other prime brokers easier.\u201d We are considering other improvements to make our prime brokerage offering even more compelling. I look forward to continuing the work on the many projects we have lined up. Much is planned for the rest of 2024 and beyond which we are eager to develop, test, and introduce. We have a healthy pipeline of new business and new initiatives, and are eager to share these with you as they come to fruition. With that, I will turn the call over to Paul Brody. Paul? Thank you, everyone, for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website, and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will talk to you next quarter end."

            "name": "Paul Brody",
            "content": "Thank you, Nancy, and welcome everyone to the call. Thanks for joining. Starting with our Revenue items on page 3 of the release, we are pleased with our financial results this quarter, as we again produced record net revenues and pretax income. Commissions rose versus last year's 2nd quarter, reaching $406 million, second only to that of the pandemic-era first quarter of 2021. This quarter, we saw higher trading volumes from our growing base of active customers, with options setting a new quarterly volume record and futures reaching their second highest volumes ever. Net interest income also reached a quarterly record of $792 million, despite only modestly higher benchmark rates in most major currencies and a recent taste of rate cuts in a few others. A more pronounced risk-on environment in the quarter led to a significant increase in margin borrowing, and higher yields on our margin loans and segregated cash portfolio on a year-over-year basis provided tailwinds to these results. These increases were partially offset by the higher interest paid to our customers on their cash balances. Interactive Brokers passes through to them all rate hikes above the first 50 basis points on their qualified funds, which makes us attractive compared to other brokers and banks, and competitive with money market funds. Other fees and services generated $68 million, up 45% from the prior year, driven by the risk-on positioning of customers in the quarter. As we report in the Financial Highlights on page 1 of our earnings release, the primary factor was an increase in risk exposure fees, with contributions from payments for order flow from exchange-mandated programs and FDIC sweep fees as well. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings. Without these excluded items, Other income was a $24 million gain for the quarter. Turning to expenses, Execution, Clearing and Distribution costs were $115 million in the quarter, up 24% over the year-ago quarter predominantly from a $9 million increase in the SEC regulatory fee rate that began on May 22nd, and on higher volumes in options and futures, which carry higher fees. The SEC fee is a pass-through to customers, so it does not impact our profitability. As a percent of commission revenues, Execution & Clearing costs were 23% in the 2nd quarter for a Gross Transactional Profit margin of 77%. We calculate this by excluding from \"Execution, Clearing and Distribution\u201d $20 million of non-transaction-based costs, predominantly market data fees, which do not have a direct commission revenue component. Compensation & Benefits expense was $146 million for the quarter, for a ratio of Compensation expense to Adjusted Net Revenues of 11%, down from 13% in last year's quarter. We remain focused on expense discipline, as reflected in our slowing the staff increase to 1% over the prior year. The year-over-year increase included a decrease in Compliance staff, as we went into full operational mode with our in-house developed Compliance system, offset by increases in client-facing and software development roles. Our headcount at June 30th was 2,951. G&A expenses were $52 million, down from the year-ago quarter. Without last year's unusual legal reserve, G&A was up 33%, or $13 million, primarily on higher advertising and, partly, on legal expenses. Our pretax margin was 72% for the quarter as reported, and 73% as adjusted. Income Taxes of $71 million reflects the sum of the public company's $36 million and the operating companies' $35 million. The public company's adjusted effective tax rate was 16.5%, slightly below its usual range. Moving to our balance sheet on page 5 of the Release, our total assets ended the quarter 13% higher than the prior year quarter-end at $137 billion, with growth driven by margin lending to both new and existing customers. New account growth also helped drive our record customer credit balances. And we believe that our strong financial standing and competitive interest rates provide customers with an attractive place to hold their idle cash. We continue to have no long-term debt. Healthy profitability drove our 20% increase in firm equity over the prior year. We maintain a balance sheet geared towards supporting growth in our existing business and helping us win new business by demonstrating our strength to prospective clients and partners. In our operating data, on pages 6 and 7, our customer contract volumes in options rose 35% over the prior-year quarter, well above industry growth, and reached a new record high for IBKR. Futures contract volumes rose by 10%, reflecting our second highest volume ever; and stock share volumes rose by 26%, as they did across the industry. Stock share volume generally increased in tandem with clients gravitating to larger, higher quality names, with relatively lower trading in pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks, in our largest markets. On page 7, you can see that total Customer DARTs were 2.4 million trades per day, up 28% from the prior year and especially strong in options, followed by stocks and futures. Commission per Cleared Commissionable Order of $3.01 was down from last year, due to a mix of smaller average order sizes in stocks and futures and lower average commission per contract in options. Volume and aggregate commissions were higher in all product classes, but the specific contracts traded by our customers have different size and commission characteristics. Page 8 shows our Net Interest Margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income was $792 million for the quarter, up 14% on the prior year, while our NIM net interest income was $805 million, or $13 million higher. In the NIM computation, we include some income that for GAAP purposes is classified as Other Fees or Other Income, but we believe is more appropriately considered interest. Our Net Interest Income reflects strength in margin loan and segregated cash interest, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. Only recently, a few central banks made 25 basis point cuts to their benchmark rates, including Europe and Canada; Switzerland cut its rate both this quarter and last. Others, including the Federal Reserve, held interest rates steady. Reflecting a modest rise in benchmark rates over the year, our segregated cash interest income rose 6% despite a 2% decrease in average balances, while margin loan interest rose by 38% on a 31% increase in average balances. The average duration of our US Treasury portfolio remained at about 30 days. With the US dollar yield curve continuing to be inverted, we have been maximizing what we earn by focusing on higher short-term yields, rather than accept the significantly lower yields of longer maturities. This strategy allows us to maintain a relatively tight maturity match between our assets and liabilities. Securities lending net interest has not been as strong as in prior quarters for three main reasons: First, throughout the industry, overall demand for shorting stocks has fallen. An extremely strong stock market, up in the US well over 20% in the past year, means fewer people are looking to put on shorts when the overall market trend is so soundly upward. Second, there are fewer \u201chard to borrow\u201d names industry-wide, not only because the overall market is rising sharply, but also due to weakness in some of the drivers relevant to securities lending, including significantly fewer IPOs, low market volatility, and static merger & acquisition activity. Finally, as noted on previous calls, higher average interest rates versus prior year periods means more of what we earn from securities lending is classified as interest on \u201csegregated cash\u201d. To more accurately reflect all the income we earn from our securities lending business, we estimate that if the additional interest earned and paid on cash collateral were included under \u201cSecurities Borrowed and Loaned\u201d, then total net revenue related to our securities lending business would have been about $194 million for the quarter; versus $190 million in the year-ago quarter; and $167 million in the first quarter of 2024. This additional revenue would be reclassified from interest on segregated cash and interest paid on customer credit balances, so it would have no effect on our overall NIM. Interest on Customer Credit Balances, the interest we pay to our customers on the cash in their accounts, rose on both higher rates in many currencies versus last year, and higher balances from new account growth. As we have noted in the past, the high interest rates we pay on customer cash \u2013 currently 4.83% on qualified US dollar balances - is a significant driver of new customers. Fully rate-sensitive customer balances were about $18.6 billion this quarter, versus $17.3 billion in the year-ago quarter. Together with firm equity, most of which consists of interest-earning assets, total fully rate-sensitive balances were approximately $30.7 billion. Now, for our estimates of the impact of changes in rates. Given market expectations of rate cuts sometime in 2024, we estimate the effect of a 25-basis point decrease in the benchmark Fed Funds rate to be a $59 million reduction in annual net interest income. Note that our starting point for this estimate is June 30th, with the Fed Funds effective rate at 5.33%, and balances as of that date. Any growth in our balance sheet and interest-earning assets would reduce this impact. About 25% of our customer cash balances is not in US dollars, so estimates of a US rate change exclude those currencies. We estimate the effect of decreases in all the relevant non-USD benchmark rates would reduce annual net interest income by $18 million for each 25-basis point decrease in those benchmarks. At a high level, a full 1% decrease in all benchmark rates would decrease our annual net interest income by $307 million. This takes into account rate-sensitive customer balances and firm equity. In conclusion, we posted another financially strong quarter in net revenues and pretax margin, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base and deliver on our core value proposition to customers while scaling the business. Our business strategy continues to be effective: Automating as much of the brokerage business as possible, continuously improving and expanding what we offer while minimizing what we charge. With that, we will now open up the line for questions. The rest is rate-sensitive firm equity. So our equity is $15 billion plus, of which certain amount of it is sensitive to interest rates. And that makes up the rest. Yeah. It's a slightly more complicated question. But if you assume zero benchmark, then all of the securities lending trading itself becomes just the borrow fee, which is high for a hard to borrow stock and low for a general collateral stock. Likewise, as we used to have when the rates are almost zero, if we were to lend a stock, taking the cash collateral and then reinvest the cash collateral in a very low interest rate environment, that cash collateral earns very little. So one of the reasons why we have decided to offer this presentation is because it didn't make any difference when the rates were near zero\u2014it didn't make much difference. But now the rates are 5% plus, it's more helpful to see all sides of the equation that are related to securities lending, right? The simplest example being we lend a customer stock. We take in the cash collateral. Now when we reinvest it, it's at more like 5.4%, and that obviously plays a role. Up until now, we have been and\u2014 in our net interest margin presentation that shows up in segregated cash and securities. But one could think of it as being related to securities lending. And so all we're talking about here is reclassifying that just from a management perspective. It's a different way to look at it. Yes. Could you repeat the question on the taxes? It just flows into gains and losses. And so there's nothing about it that would not be taxable as a general expense, it is. And there were no other real notable items. Every quarter, there are some tax items that may not apply directly to the current quarter like tax credits, things like that. So these come and go, that primarily is what causes minor fluctuations in our overall effective tax rate. Yeah, that's exactly right, Chris. So the $59 million is an assumption that only the Fed moves the US dollar rate, and the $77 million it makes a very broad assumption that all currency rates or rates in all currencies are reduced."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by, and welcome to Interactive Brokers Group First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Nancy Stuebe, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nNancy Stuebe: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us today are Thomas Peterffy, our Founder and Chairman; Milan Galik, our President and CEO; and Paul Brody, our CFO. I will be presenting Milan's comments on the business, and all three will be available at our Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. This quarter, many of the same trends we saw in 2023 continued to play out. With market indexes on the rise worldwide and the popularity of investing growing, we see global interest from investors who increasingly want broad portfolios with some invested in securities in their home markets, but a more significant portion invested overseas, particularly in U.S. securities. Product wise, industry options contract volumes, both individual securities and 0DTE, were up as the popularity continued. Since the pandemic, average daily volume in OCC options has more than doubled from about 20 million contracts a day in 2019 to 40 million in 2022 and now a record 47.5 million in the first quarter. CME futures volumes, though down slightly from last year when investors were trading actively in the direction of interest rates, are up versus last quarter and meaningfully above pre-pandemic levels. And on the equities front, nearly every stock market around the world was up this quarter, with the exception of Hong Kong and China. This is a similar pattern to what we saw in 2023. The popularity of the Magnificent Seven technology names continues, which has meant that many investors hold on to their positions and are distinctly not looking to make any changes like selling them and buying new names. The Magnificent Seven are not gripping the index quite as firmly as last year when they represented 75% of the S&P 500's first quarter performance versus 43% in this quarter, but their stock price strength means investors have not needed to look elsewhere for gains. And as happened in 2023, industry equities volumes are down again as a result. What all of the above has meant for our business starts with strong account growth as we add more investors to our platform, both institutional and individual. In the first quarter, we added 184,000 new accounts, second only to the meme stock days of the first quarter 2021. We added in this one quarter twice the number of accounts we added in all of 2019. New accounts meant more cash in those accounts, which helped raise our client credit balances to a record $104.9 billion. Our client equity was up 36% to $466 billion, meaning we are approaching $0.5 trillion of client assets. Volume wise, we saw strong contract volumes in options, up 24% in the quarter and significantly ahead of the industry, and slightly weaker volumes in futures and equities, similar to the industry. However, rising equity markets have led clients to feel more comfortable with taking on risk, so they took on more assertive positions, which increased our exposure fee revenue, and took on more leverage to bolster their positions, increasing our margin loans, which exceeded $50 billion for the first time since 2021, and our margin interest income. This translated to strong financial results. Commission revenue was second only to the meme stock spike of the first quarter of 2021 and net interest income reached a record as did total revenues. We always focus on our expenses, meaning our pre-tax income also reached a record and our pre-tax profit margin remained at an industry leading 72%. In recognition of this and as a sign of our confidence in our business model and growth potential, we revisited the amount of dividend we pay and decided to increase it to $0.25 a quarter. We recognized that the dividend was unchanged since we initiated it at $0.10 in 2011, a time when we had 170,000 accounts, quarterly earnings of $222 million and capital of $4.4 billion. Today, we enjoy a strong capital position, which will allow us to be opportunistic in the M&A space should the right opportunity arise, but we would like to acknowledge our shareholders by returning some capital to them. In terms of how the business looked on the client front, our accounts and client equity grew fastest in Europe and Asia, similar to what I mentioned earlier, growing numbers of investors worldwide wanting access to international and particularly U.S. markets. Individuals saw the fastest account growth among our five client segments, with introducing brokers and proprietary traders close behind. On the client equity side, financial advisors grew the fastest, followed by individuals and i-brokers. Proprietary traders had the fastest commission growth, while net interest growth was led by introducing brokers, followed by hedge funds and individuals. Speaking of introducing brokers, our pipeline of potential clients remains healthy. There are several of these opportunities, about a couple dozen of them, at various stages. Some are in the testing stage. Others have started onboarding so called friends and family accounts where they test the waters and make sure that everything is working, while others are in the prospect stage to figure out what the optimal way for them to interface with us is. This can take time since we offer a variety of ways for an introducing broker to come onto our platform. On the one hand, it can be as simple as a broker white labeling our services, in which case the start up is very quick. On the other, it can be quite complex for i-brokers who want to have their own client-facing user interfaces, so they take longer to integrate with us. In between these two, there are many different setups with varying degrees of nuance and distinctions as the broker picks and chooses the level of integration and coupling that works best based on its needs and on what it is able to support in-house. In terms of new product introductions, we had a busy quarter. We are pleased to introduce our High Touch Prime Brokerage service, which we announced last week. Hedge funds in our High Touch program will have a dedicated relationship manager and direct access to subject matter experts as well as to an in-person 24/5 Global Outsourced Trading Desk. We consider the mission of the High Touch service to be \"find a way to yes\" for our clients' requests. For those hedge funds listening, I am sure there's a piece of your portfolio you could consider allocating to us. Regarding our platforms, we introduced IBKR Desktop, a streamlined, simpler-to-use, next-generation desktop trading application for Windows and Mac. IBKR Desktop is now sufficiently resource-rich, stable and available to our clients. We've added MultiSort Screeners, Option Analysis and other enhancements to name a few. For our flagship Trader Workstation, we added a multi-stock tax loss harvesting tool. And for IBKR Mobile, we engineered information architecture and navigation from the ground up. Our registered investment advisor clients got a host of new tools this quarter, including an improved Message Center, a reworked Advisor Portal menu with new features for managing contacts, accounts, and portfolios, and ways for the platform to assist with filing their Form ADVs. Automating substantial parts of the brokerage business for client success is the heart of what we do. There is much we are looking forward to and much work to be done as there always is and as every software developer will tell you. We are as busy as we've ever been and continue to see global demand for access to all markets. This trend and our ability to serve it with a much lower cost structure and a much broader product and toolset is what sets us apart and we'll continue to do so in the years ahead. With that, I will turn the call over to Paul Brody. Paul?\nPaul Brody: Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. I will review the first quarter results and then, of course, we'll open it up for questions. Starting with our revenue items on Page 3 of the release, we're pleased with our financial results this quarter as we again produced record net revenues and pre-tax income. Commissions rose versus last year's first quarter, reaching $379 million. This quarter, we saw higher trading volumes from our growing base of active customers, particularly in options, which set a new quarterly volume record. Net interest income also reached a quarterly record of $747 million, reflecting a risk on environment in the quarter versus last year that led to more margin borrowing as well as higher yields on our margin loans and segregated cash portfolio. These are partially offset by the higher interest paid to our customers on their cash balances. Interactive Brokers passes through to them all rate hikes above the first 50 basis points on their qualified funds, which makes us attractive compared to other brokers and banks and competitive with money market funds. Other fees and services generated $59 million, up 37% from the prior year, driven by the risk on positioning of customers in the quarter. As we report in the financial highlights on Page 1 of our earnings release, the primary factor was an increase in risk exposure fees with a contribution from FDIC sweep fees as well. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings. Without these excluded items, other income was $31 million for the quarter. Turning to expenses, execution, clearing and distribution costs were $101 million in the quarter, up 6% over the year-ago quarter on higher volumes in options, which carry higher fees. As a percent of commission revenues, execution and clearing costs were 21% in the first quarter for a gross transactional profit margin of 79%. We calculate this by excluding from execution, clearing and distribution $21 million of non-transaction based costs, predominantly market data, which do not have a direct commission revenue component. Compensation and benefits expense was $145 million for the quarter, for a ratio of compensation expense to adjusted net revenues of 12%, down slightly from last year's quarter. We remain focused on expense discipline as reflected in our slowing the staff increase to 3% over the prior year. Our headcount at March 31 was 2,956. G&A expenses were $50 million, up from the year-ago quarter on higher advertising and legal expenses. Our pre-tax margin was 72% for the quarter. Income taxes of $71 million reflects the sum of the public company's $36 million and the operating company's $35 million. The public company's adjusted effective tax rate was 17.2%, within its usual range and similar to the prior year. Moving to our balance sheet on Page 5 of the release, the consistent strength of our business and our healthy balance sheet supports our raising the dividend from $0.40 per year to $1, returning capital to shareholders while still maintaining an ample capital base for the current business and future opportunities. Our total assets ended the quarter 11% higher at $132 billion with growth driven by margin lending to both new and existing customers. We continue to have no long-term debt. We maintain a balance sheet geared towards supporting growth in our existing business and helping us win new business by demonstrating our strength to prospective clients and partners. In our operating data, on Pages 6 and 7, our contract volumes in options for all customers rose 24% over the prior-year quarter, well above industry growth. Futures contract volumes and stock share volumes declined as they did across the industry. The decrease in stock share volume occurred in tandem with clients gravitating to larger, higher quality names with lower trading and pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks. In fact, despite the decline in share volume, the total notional value of brokerage shares traded was up in many markets, particularly in the U.S. On Page 7, you can see that total customer DARTs were 2.4 million trades per day, up 14% from the prior year, and especially strong in options followed by stocks and foreign exchange. Commission per -- cleared commissionable order of $2.93 was down from last year due to a mix of smaller average order sizes in stocks and options and larger in futures. Stocks and options contributed higher overall volumes but smaller average order sizes, while futures contributed lower volume with larger average order size. Page 8 shows our net interest margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income was $747 million for the quarter, up 17%, while our NIM net interest income was $762 million, or $15 million higher. In the NIM computation, we include some income that for GAAP purposes is classified as other fees or other income, but we believe it's more appropriately considered interest. Our net interest income reflects strength in margin loan and segregated cash interest, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. Most central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, held interest rates steady this quarter. Exceptions included a rate rise in Japan from negative 10 basis points to zero to positive 10 basis points, and a 25 basis point rate cut in the Swiss franc benchmark. Reflecting the rise in benchmark rates over the year, our segregated cash interest income rose 26% on a 2% increase in average balances, while margin loan interest rose by 42% on a 19% increase in average balances. The average duration of our portfolio remained at less than 30 days. With the U.S. dollar yield curve continuing to be inverted, we have been maximizing what we earn by focusing on higher short-term yields rather than accept the significantly lower yields of longer maturities. This strategy allows us to maintain a relatively tight maturity match between our assets and liabilities. Securities lending net interest has not been as strong as in prior quarters for three main reasons. First, throughout the industry, overall demand for shorting stocks has fallen. An extremely strong stock market, up in the U.S. nearly 30% in the past year and 10% in the first quarter alone means fewer people are looking to put on shorts when the overall market trend is so soundly upward. Second, there are fewer hard-to-borrow names industry-wide, not only because the overall market is rising sharply, but also due to weakness in some of the drivers relevant to securities lending, including significantly fewer IPOs, low market volatility, and less merger and acquisition activity. Finally, as noted on previous calls, higher average interest rates versus prior-year periods means more of what we earn from securities lending is classified as interest on segregated cash. To more accurately compare our securities lending revenue with last year, we estimate that if the additional interest earned on cash collateral were reported under securities borrowed and loaned, it would have been $12 million higher or $38 million. Interest on customer credit balances, the interest we pay to our customers on the cash in their account, rose on both higher rates in nearly all currencies and higher balances from new account growth. As we have noted many times in the past, the high interest rates we pay on customer cash, currently 4.83% on qualified U.S. dollar balances, is a significant driver of new customers. Fully rate-sensitive customer balances were about $18.5 billion this quarter versus $17.2 billion in the year-ago quarter, and firm equity, most of which consists of interest-earning assets, increased 20% over the prior year. Now, for our estimates of the impact of changes in rates. Given market expectations of rate cuts sometime in 2024, we estimate the effect of a 25 basis point decrease in the benchmark Fed funds rate to be a $58 million reduction in annual net interest income. Note that our starting point for this estimate is March 31, with the Fed fund's effective rate at 5.33% and balances as of that date. Any growth in our balance sheet and interest-earning assets would reduce this impact. About 25% of our customer cash balances is not in U.S. dollars, so estimates of a U.S. rate change exclude those currencies. We estimate the effective decreases in all of the relevant non-USD benchmark rates would reduce annual net interest income by $18 million for each 25 basis point decrease in those benchmarks. At a high level, a full 1% decrease in all the benchmark rates would decrease our annual net interest income by about $304 million. This takes into account rate-sensitive customer balances and firm equity. In conclusion, we started the year with another financially strong quarter in net revenues and pre-tax margin, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base and deliver on our core value proposition to customers while scaling the business. We raised our dividend in recognition of our financial strength. Our business strategy continues to be effective, automating as much of the brokerage business as possible and expanding what we offer while minimizing what we charge. With that, I'll turn it over to the moderator, and we'll open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question. And our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good evening, everyone. I wanted to start with capital management with the dividend hike. The dividend payout is still just 15% of profits and you have upwards of $15 billion of equity capital and this is growing each quarter. So, what should our read-through be on the increase? Should we expect additional increases as profits grow each year? And is this somewhat related to a lack of M&A opportunities following the two deals that broke down that you highlighted on the 4Q call in January?\nMilan Galik: Thanks for the question. So, of the $15 billion equity, what you have to take into consideration is that a lot of that capital is needed to run the business. So, what remains as usable for M&A is significantly smaller. Now for the dividend, we are happy with the number that we came up with. It's approximately 15% payout ratio of the earnings and we believe that this amount of dividend is sustainable, yet it allows us to continue to build the capital that we enjoy to have for the potential M&A opportunities.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks, Milan. And just as my follow-up, I wanted to get your perspective on the improving retail engagement backdrop. And we're seeing this at company and other companies across multiple metrics, margin loan growth, activity rates and trading, organic growth with the account growth deceleration. So, I'm just wondering how much upside do you expect from the individual investor business if markets continue to recover here. And we assume 2021 is not repeatable again, but 2024 was likely a floor. So, any reference points or color on that would be helpful.\nMilan Galik: It's very hard for me to speculate as to how it's going to continue. What we see is increasing engagement of what you would call retail traders in the options markets. They become more comfortable with the options. They recognize how flexible of a financial instrument an option is. You can use it to trade on leverage, you can use it to generate income, you can use it to speculate. And as Paul had mentioned a little earlier, we have seen significant growth in the options volume. So that, I think, is going to continue, and the public will get more and more comfortable with the financial instrument. As to are we going to see the same levels of volume and account growth as we've seen at the beginning of the pandemic? Probably not. If you remember, that was a very different world. For a few months, the markets dropped very significantly. There was a lot of volatility in the market. Everybody was closed at home. There was not that much to do other than watching the Netflix shows and open brokerage accounts and start trading, which was then followed by the meme stock mania. So, I do not expect something like this to happen anytime soon.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Milan.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Benjamin Budish from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi. Good evening, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Paul. You mentioned in your prepared remarks that you were sort of leaning into the shorter end of the curve, given the inversion in the yield curve. I just wanted to check that sounds pretty consistent with your previously communicated approach to risk management. But is there anything to read there, like if the yield curve were to invert and maybe given the knowledge you have of your customer base or the behavior you've observed, does that suggest that at some point in the future, you might be comfortable sort of extending the duration? Or should we assume maybe a more consistent, very, very low-risk management approach to the balance sheet?\nThomas Peterffy: I'm responsible for the investment of these monies, so -- and this is Thomas. As long as the yield curve remains inverted, we are going to stay with our current profile. And at the time when that changes, we will consider extending our maturity depending upon the circumstances.\nBenjamin Budish: Okay. Appreciate that. And then maybe one, just another kind of follow-up to Craig's question on the dividend. I know there's a lot of focus on M&A. And if supposedly nothing were to materialize, would you consider in the future a more like dividend growth -- more of a dividend growth cadence or are you kind of more hopeful on M&A? Just sort of curious how you're thinking about like the range of outcomes. It sounds like the $0.25 is more fixed rather than like a 15% payout ratio. But I'm wondering if that would sort of change or it could potentially change in the future. Thank you.\nMilan Galik: So, if you look, it took us a number of years to raise the dividend from $0.10 to $0.25. So, I'm not saying that it's going to take us another decade to do the same, but we will remain nimble. Capital situation is very important to us. The fortress balance sheet is something that we really enjoy. We believe that it attracts the institutional clients. They see a healthy company, despite that, we do not have a 150-year-long history like some of our big competitors in the hedge fund space, we believe that this rock-solid capital position is attractive to the investors and clients. So, we would like to maintain it. So, this $1 per year dividend, I think strikes a good balance. So for now, I think this is it.\nBenjamin Budish: All right. I appreciate that very much. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from James Yaro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJames Yaro: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. My first one is on account growth. Accounts grew 25% year-on-year in the first quarter. And I found the comments on the fact that you're working with a number of i-brokers to potentially add the platform over time. Quite interesting. In light of this, maybe you could just comment on how sustainable you view this recent account growth. And maybe if not, maybe you could just break down what customer types or geographies are driving the stronger growth versus a few quarters ago?\nMilan Galik: The strongest segment in terms of number of new accounts was the individual accounts, just like it happened in the last quarter of last year. After that, it was the introducing brokers. Now introducing brokers are a very important segment because they help us attract accounts in their local jurisdictions that maybe less sophisticated accounts than the ones that come to us directly. We think this is very sustainable. We continue to add tools to our platform. We have a pipeline of introducing brokers that has around two dozen to three dozen different companies integrating with us as we speak. We have been talking about the two larger introducing brokers for a while, so we have already announced that the first one of them has been with us and is happily trading. And the second one has finally started operations. They are starting slowly with one single geographical location in the Middle East. They have opened a few dozen accounts so far. They are in the so-called friends and family mode, but they're going to be ramping it up. And what we are hoping to do with this global bank, one of the top 10 global banks out there, what we're hoping to do is we are hoping to integrate with them fast going forward, so the new countries can be added. Now, what I have to do here is manage your expectations somewhat. We are dealing with a wealth management branch of a multinational bank that is basically starting a new business of attracting self-traders. So, we are not talking about migrating a large number of accounts, but what we are hoping for is a healthy new business for this global bank that is going to be then gradually onboarding new accounts to us.\nJames Yaro: Okay. That's very clear. Maybe just on securities lending, activity there continues to be somewhat subdued across the industry as well as for you. Maybe just your views on what gets this part of the business going.\nMilan Galik: Paul, would you like to take this one?\nPaul Brody: Yeah, sure. So, as usual, there's a baseline that grows as our customer base grows. Having said that, that baseline on the short side has been retreating over the last quite a number of months now across the industry, less interest in shorting stocks. So, that's on the one side. And then on the other, really, where we do quite well in lending stocks that are in great demand, the shorts drive that as well because we can only lend it to other people who are going short, so that tends to go down. And we've built great tools for recognizing what the rate should be and taking advantage of them to the best we can. But there are only so many opportunities out there in the market and there really haven't been any extremely hot stocks, if you will, very high, hard-to-borrow rate stocks, and that drives the business as well. So, those will come and go. And when they show up, we have the tools to make the most of it.\nJames Yaro: That makes a lot of sense. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies LLC. Your line is now open.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Just was curious in the quarter how many introducing brokers were onboarded to the platform. And then, if you could talk about the two to three dozen? You clearly have some of the large -- you mentioned some large global banks, so maybe just the average size as we think about that opportunity that's in the pipeline currently?\nMilan Galik: So, the two or three dozen are integrations, in general. They may be large financial advisers who have decided to interface with us electronically or they could be introducing brokers. The sizes vary. We typically get introducing brokers that are just starting off. And from time to time, we get an introducing broker that decided to change the prime brokers. In Asia, we have just gotten online a couple of virtual banks. We have finished the integration of the large global bank that I mentioned a few minutes ago. We have a SEC registered advisor that integrated with us and went online. And then, we have many in the funnel at various stages. Some of them are still trying to figure out what the best way for them to integrate with us is, while others are busy integrating and then the third group is already doing some test rates.\nThomas Peterffy: Just for more clarity, if I may add, many of these brokers open omnibus accounts, so it doesn't necessarily show up as a large number of new accounts because an omnibus broker basically gives us one account, while he may have hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands accounts on his end. But we obviously get all the trading volume.\nDan Fannon: Understood. And then just as a follow-up, another question on capital. You talked about excess capital. We know there's regulatory capital and there's what you want to maintain as a buffer to keep the fortress balance sheet. Can you talk about what is excess as we think about not only dividend and M&A, in terms of what we -- is potentially for use on an inorganic or capital return?\nMilan Galik: So, I would say around $6 billion of the capital is the excess that is not necessary to run the business. So, that gives you some idea of what the number is. Now, are we trying to go out there and spend it fast like a drunken sailor? Of course not. But we are carefully looking at the opportunities that come our way. And to tell you the truth, we find it difficult. The rule of thumb is that more than 70% of the acquisitions out there do not deliver the promised value. We do not have a lot of experience in the M&A space, so we are extra diligent. And although we were very close to do two very large acquisitions, in the end, we were not able to agree on a price. So, this trend can continue, but I am hopeful that we will be able to do an acquisition and speed up the organic growth of accounts.\nDan Fannon: Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Moley: Yes, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Thomas, I just caught your interview on CNBC before the call here. It sounded like you didn't think margin loans could really go much higher from here. It sounded like I think you said historically maybe the jump that we've seen recently might be an indication that balances are a little bit overextended. So, just hoping you could maybe just provide some more color there, how we should think about margin loan growth trajectory in the short term and whether those comments were any sort of indication that of what you'd seen in April?\nThomas Peterffy: Let me put it this way. I hope that they're not going much higher because I'm a nervous nellie. When margin loans shoot up, that always is followed by a quick collapse in the market. And that's my almost 50-year experience.\nPatrick Moley: Okay. All right. No, that's helpful. And then, I guess just as a follow-up, you recently unveiled the IBKR Desktop offering. I was hoping you could talk just about what you think that platform offers and what it can mean for account growth going forward?\nMilan Galik: Well, perhaps, I can give you a little bit of a history first. We have created the broker to attract and cater to professional traders' highly-sophisticated accounts. We have developed the Desktop, the original Desktop TWS for them. We have been adding features to it very fast over the last 20-plus years. So, we have a very mature platform that has all the capabilities a professional trader of any kind could wish for. Now, we made that platform available to everybody, because our systems are highly scalable. We are very happy to take on accounts of any size. Over time, we have learned that some of the clients find the platform overwhelming. So, we have added a web platform. We have added two different types of mobile trader, a sophisticated one and less sophisticated one. But the flagship platform is still there, generates a lot of business, but it is getting somewhat older. It has been online for longer than couple of decades. So, we decided to brand -- to build a brand new one, a brand new desktop, which is going to be -- which is simpler than the original one. It has reduced functionality set. It does not cater to all sorts of professional traders, but the account holder that it has in mind is the active trader. So, that is what that new Desktop Trader Workstation is meant to be used by. It went online this first quarter. We continue to add functionality to it. We will continue to do so going forward. But we will try to remain disciplined so that we do not over clutter it with features that are not frequently used. The feedback that we're getting from our clients is very good. We are on very -- we talk to them often. We grade the platform in terms of usability, how easy it is to find features on it, how easy it is to trade on it. So, we look at these grades all the time and adjust as necessary. And we are getting questions already for the professional accounts and from i-brokers when we are going to make the platform available to them, which I consider to be a very good sign, because that was not originally the plan, but there is already demand for it. So, I'm so far very happy with how the platform is performing.\nPatrick Moley: All right. Thank you for that.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Chris Allen from Citi. Your line is now open.\nChris Allen: Yeah, good afternoon, everyone. Maybe wanted to touch on the hedge fund client base. You noted establishing a High Touch PB service. I'm just wondering, did that require additional hiring for that client segment? What kind of progress are you making in terms of moving up some of the tables you talked about in the past? And any additional areas of growth to further penetrate that client segment?\nMilan Galik: So, this is brand new. We have really just announced it towards the end of last week and we have notified the accounts, the 30 or so hedge funds that we have on the platform, we have invited them into this new service, High Touch Prime Brokerage service. The goal obviously is to attract hedge funds that are larger than, let's say, $100 million of equity, or to keep on our platform the ones that started small, but they have reached the assets level that would allow them to go to one of our larger competitors. So, we have done -- we have had a lot of discussions with the hedge funds, with some of the professionals at the prime brokerage space, and we have learned what the hedge funds -- the larger hedge funds expect of their prime broker. And number one thing that they expect is the white glove or a high touch service. So that is what this offering is. The eligible hedge fund will have single point of contact and will receive elevated service from Interactive Brokers. As part of the service, we are establishing a 24/5 Global Outsourced Trading Desk for these clients. These clients will get access to subject matter experts from various supporting functional groups, compliance, risk, funds and banking, securities finance and others. So, we believe that they will find what they usually expect from the large competing brokers. So, this was the first step that we are taking here, and over time, we will see how well it's working.\nChris Allen: Understood. And then maybe one additional quick question. Last quarter you mentioned looking at efficiency opportunities in areas such as surveillance and customer service. Wonder if you made any progress in those fronts? Any other areas of -- you can wring out some efficiencies moving forward, which I mean, obviously, given your margins, you're already incredibly efficient. So, it's asking a lot a little bit, but just any color on that front would be great.\nMilan Galik: We are continuously working on our electronic surveillance. As a broker, it is our obligation to surveil the trading activities and the movement of cash. We built our systems in-house, even though a lot of our competitors use third-party software. We looked at a few different third-party software packages that are available. We found them too expensive and not really suitable for us because our business is global. So that is why we decided a few years ago to build our own. And the system generates alerts, and the alerts are serviced by human operators which deem the alert either false positive or true positive. And if the alert points to a problem, then they either file a report with the regulator or they act according to the script that we have given to them. We have a significant number of operators that use this system and our goal is not to add more as the number of account increases, as the volumes increase, and as the cash moves increase. So that is the goal. And now, how we're going about it is continuously improving the platform, reducing the number of false positives, deploying some artificial intelligence techniques. So, that is what we have been doing for the past year or so. Similarly, on the customer service, our goal is not to have to grow the employees that work for the customer service department in proportion with the number of new accounts that we add. Now, how are we exactly accomplishing that is that we are making the service self-service. We are trying to reduce the number of phone calls our customer service department receives, the number of chats, the number of tickets, but by making it very easy or much easier for our clients to find self-help through the platform that we give them. And here again, we are using various techniques. Lately, we have dabbled into generative AI and we are seeing good results. But this is a process that will continue that we will always be working on.\nChris Allen: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is now open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good evening. Milan, maybe just a follow-up on that prior question on efficiency. You noted harnessing AI potentially on the customer service side. I guess any progress here in terms of are you rolling out new generative AI bots? Is that part of the -- and is that really just to help your customer service reps, or is that directly going to be deployed to end users that are on the platform, retail users on the platform? And then, on the revenue side, as it pertains to AI, is that being utilized by any of your clients at all in trading or deploying trading strategies? And just wondering if you think there could be a real revenue opportunity here as well.\nMilan Galik: The first question was about who uses the AI capabilities that we have developed for customer service. It is both our customer service representative as well as our clients. When they ask a question through our platform, we map the question that is in natural language into the most suitable set of documents that have the ability to answer that question. And then, we apply some generative AI algorithms to the set of documents that we find, and we return an answer to the client. And something similar happens inside when the customer service representatives of Interactive Brokers uses the system. Now, as far as the trading using the AI, we do not yet have anything available for our clients in terms of the platform utilizing the AI, but we have discussions in-house and we have some, I believe, good ideas that we're going to be working on going forward.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. And then just a follow-up on the expenses as well. You noted the headcount has slowed partially due to what you kind of just laid out. It's only up 2% or 3% year-on-year. It sounds like you're going to try to hold that roughly flattish, or at least at a slower level looking forward. But when we think about compensation, it looks like that's up 10% in the first quarter, I think fixed expenses were up roughly 17% year-on-year. So, I guess given some of the new initiatives like this High Touch Prime Brokerage offering, should we expect this divergence in kind of fixed expense growth versus the headcount growth to persist at least over the next few quarters?\nMilan Galik: So, the headcount growth is easier to keep in check. In terms of the compensations, we have to deal with a couple of different factors. One of them is the inflation. Their lives are getting more expensive and we have to pay our employees more. And also the talent, the really good talent is getting more expensive. There are lots of tech and financial companies out there fighting for good talent, and we need to make sure that we keep the employees with Interactive Brokers and we are able to attract the new ones. And the recent historical trend has been such that the prices of the human resources have been going up.\nKyle Voigt: Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Macrae Sykes from GAMCO. Your line is now open.\nMacrae Sykes: Good afternoon, everyone. I just -- it goes without saying, I think Rich Repetto was a great addition to the Board. I've long admired his work in the industry. My question is around the impact of zero-day options on the marketplace. I can understand they're really good for liquidity and choice, but is there a potential to kind of burn out investors given the obvious churn?\nMilan Galik: Well, every great tool can be misused and requires some amount of responsibility, if you will. The same can be said about one-day options. Now, what Thomas usually says when facing a question about zero-day options is that we have always had them. When you think back when only the monthly options were tradable on the expiration date, those options were zero-day options. Then the exchanges started listing weekly options, and then we had this event of an option becoming a zero-day option more frequent, and now we have them every day. So, it is not something that came out of nowhere. It's just -- there is a lot more of it available now. These options, CBOE has recently issued a document justifying their existence and reiterating the power and their use. And they have referred to the ability to hedge quickly, to ability to get into a position that is sensitive to a market move very quickly. So it is a good powerful tool. But as I have started in my paragraph, my answer, it can be misused.\nMacrae Sykes: Thank you. And on the prime brokerage revenue, I understand the balances, trading. Are there any ancillary kind of fee revenues that would go with this High Touch service or is it just bundled in terms of using the platform?\nMilan Galik: This is mostly about convenience, especially when you look at the Global Outsourced Trading Desk. We found that some hedge funds would like to take advantage of our ability to provide global products to them. They do not want to be up and trading at their desk 24 hours a day and they would welcome an opportunity to give us an order during the day, during the American day to work an order during Asian hours in Asian markets. That is what we are trying to outsource. So, obviously, we're going to charge a little more for that type of trading than the fully electronic self-trading. But it really is about the convenience. It is about attracting larger funds and keeping around the ones that started small, but grew big.\nMacrae Sykes: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Brennan Hawken from UBS. Your line is now open.\nBrennan Hawken: My questions have been asked. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for a follow-up questions. And our follow-up question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Craig, if your line is on mute, could you please unmute it?\nCraig Siegenthaler: Sorry about that. Thanks for taking the follow-up. So, Kyle asked a similar question, but let me ask it a different way on AI. Do you think artificial intelligence could be a driver of the next leg of volume growth and potentially be a commission accelerator? And I'm curious how your clients are using AI to trade automatically today.\nMilan Galik: Can it act as an accelerator? It absolutely can in the long run. Today, for a typical investor, it takes a while to decide what kind of a trade they want to do. There is usually some research involved, either fundamental or some technical analysis. Imagine in the future, you will have an AI engine available to you that is going to be able to quickly ask your question -- answer your questions, quickly do analysis for you, even recommend opportunities that you have -- you normally look at. So, I believe that is going to accelerate the trading in the future. And as to your other question, how are our traders -- our trading clients using the AI today, maybe they have their own tools, but at the moment, we are not offering any AI-based trading tools to them. But in the future, we're planning to.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. And I actually just have one more follow-up on 0DTE SPX. This became a really big product last year. I'm just wondering if you can talk about which of your client segments you're seeing the highest penetration rates of 0DTE?\nMilan Galik: To tell you the truth, we do not look at it from the point of view of which client segment trades them the most for a very simple reason, it does not make a lot of a difference to us. We charge our public transparent commission to all segments the same way. So, for that reason, we are not really focusing on that. But I would tell you that just from reading newspapers out there, the zero dated options, they became a phenomenon that is participated on by the retail clients. So, I would say it's both the professionals and the retail.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Milan, thank you very much. Have a good evening.\nMilan Galik: Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for another follow-up. And our follow-up is Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is open.\nKyle Voigt: Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just a modeling follow-up for Paul. When we look on an adjusted basis, the other income line of $31 million came in higher than expected. Was that increase in that line specifically mostly driven by better market making activity? And then, in the footnotes, I also believe you disclosed there was roughly $9 million of interest like income that flowed through that line specifically. That is included in your NII walk, but it ends up in other income bucket on the income statement. Is that just interest income on capital that's deployed for the market making business or is that being generated by something else?\nPaul Brody: Right. To the second question first, yes, it's a shift. Sometimes we invest our house capital in instruments that don't generate interest from a GAAP accounting standpoint and they end up being reported in other income. So, yes to that point. And also yes to trading activities produced a better result this year than certainly in last year's quarter and somewhat better than in the fourth quarter as well. So, we're not unhappy with our very small remaining market making operations.\nKyle Voigt: And is that operation mostly focused in the U.S. or internationally? Can you just remind us what that has kind of exposure for modeling?\nPaul Brody: Yeah. We operate in India and in Hong Kong.\nKyle Voigt: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And thank you. And I'm showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Nancy Stuebe for closing remarks.\nNancy Stuebe: Thank you everyone for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will talk to you next quarter-end.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Milan Galik",
            "content": "Thanks for the question. So, of the $15 billion equity, what you have to take into consideration is that a lot of that capital is needed to run the business. So, what remains as usable for M&A is significantly smaller. Now for the dividend, we are happy with the number that we came up with. It's approximately 15% payout ratio of the earnings and we believe that this amount of dividend is sustainable, yet it allows us to continue to build the capital that we enjoy to have for the potential M&A opportunities. It's very hard for me to speculate as to how it's going to continue. What we see is increasing engagement of what you would call retail traders in the options markets. They become more comfortable with the options. They recognize how flexible of a financial instrument an option is. You can use it to trade on leverage, you can use it to generate income, you can use it to speculate. And as Paul had mentioned a little earlier, we have seen significant growth in the options volume. So that, I think, is going to continue, and the public will get more and more comfortable with the financial instrument. As to are we going to see the same levels of volume and account growth as we've seen at the beginning of the pandemic? Probably not. If you remember, that was a very different world. For a few months, the markets dropped very significantly. There was a lot of volatility in the market. Everybody was closed at home. There was not that much to do other than watching the Netflix shows and open brokerage accounts and start trading, which was then followed by the meme stock mania. So, I do not expect something like this to happen anytime soon. So, if you look, it took us a number of years to raise the dividend from $0.10 to $0.25. So, I'm not saying that it's going to take us another decade to do the same, but we will remain nimble. Capital situation is very important to us. The fortress balance sheet is something that we really enjoy. We believe that it attracts the institutional clients. They see a healthy company, despite that, we do not have a 150-year-long history like some of our big competitors in the hedge fund space, we believe that this rock-solid capital position is attractive to the investors and clients. So, we would like to maintain it. So, this $1 per year dividend, I think strikes a good balance. So for now, I think this is it. The strongest segment in terms of number of new accounts was the individual accounts, just like it happened in the last quarter of last year. After that, it was the introducing brokers. Now introducing brokers are a very important segment because they help us attract accounts in their local jurisdictions that maybe less sophisticated accounts than the ones that come to us directly. We think this is very sustainable. We continue to add tools to our platform. We have a pipeline of introducing brokers that has around two dozen to three dozen different companies integrating with us as we speak. We have been talking about the two larger introducing brokers for a while, so we have already announced that the first one of them has been with us and is happily trading. And the second one has finally started operations. They are starting slowly with one single geographical location in the Middle East. They have opened a few dozen accounts so far. They are in the so-called friends and family mode, but they're going to be ramping it up. And what we are hoping to do with this global bank, one of the top 10 global banks out there, what we're hoping to do is we are hoping to integrate with them fast going forward, so the new countries can be added. Now, what I have to do here is manage your expectations somewhat. We are dealing with a wealth management branch of a multinational bank that is basically starting a new business of attracting self-traders. So, we are not talking about migrating a large number of accounts, but what we are hoping for is a healthy new business for this global bank that is going to be then gradually onboarding new accounts to us. Paul, would you like to take this one? So, the two or three dozen are integrations, in general. They may be large financial advisers who have decided to interface with us electronically or they could be introducing brokers. The sizes vary. We typically get introducing brokers that are just starting off. And from time to time, we get an introducing broker that decided to change the prime brokers. In Asia, we have just gotten online a couple of virtual banks. We have finished the integration of the large global bank that I mentioned a few minutes ago. We have a SEC registered advisor that integrated with us and went online. And then, we have many in the funnel at various stages. Some of them are still trying to figure out what the best way for them to integrate with us is, while others are busy integrating and then the third group is already doing some test rates. So, I would say around $6 billion of the capital is the excess that is not necessary to run the business. So, that gives you some idea of what the number is. Now, are we trying to go out there and spend it fast like a drunken sailor? Of course not. But we are carefully looking at the opportunities that come our way. And to tell you the truth, we find it difficult. The rule of thumb is that more than 70% of the acquisitions out there do not deliver the promised value. We do not have a lot of experience in the M&A space, so we are extra diligent. And although we were very close to do two very large acquisitions, in the end, we were not able to agree on a price. So, this trend can continue, but I am hopeful that we will be able to do an acquisition and speed up the organic growth of accounts. Well, perhaps, I can give you a little bit of a history first. We have created the broker to attract and cater to professional traders' highly-sophisticated accounts. We have developed the Desktop, the original Desktop TWS for them. We have been adding features to it very fast over the last 20-plus years. So, we have a very mature platform that has all the capabilities a professional trader of any kind could wish for. Now, we made that platform available to everybody, because our systems are highly scalable. We are very happy to take on accounts of any size. Over time, we have learned that some of the clients find the platform overwhelming. So, we have added a web platform. We have added two different types of mobile trader, a sophisticated one and less sophisticated one. But the flagship platform is still there, generates a lot of business, but it is getting somewhat older. It has been online for longer than couple of decades. So, we decided to brand -- to build a brand new one, a brand new desktop, which is going to be -- which is simpler than the original one. It has reduced functionality set. It does not cater to all sorts of professional traders, but the account holder that it has in mind is the active trader. So, that is what that new Desktop Trader Workstation is meant to be used by. It went online this first quarter. We continue to add functionality to it. We will continue to do so going forward. But we will try to remain disciplined so that we do not over clutter it with features that are not frequently used. The feedback that we're getting from our clients is very good. We are on very -- we talk to them often. We grade the platform in terms of usability, how easy it is to find features on it, how easy it is to trade on it. So, we look at these grades all the time and adjust as necessary. And we are getting questions already for the professional accounts and from i-brokers when we are going to make the platform available to them, which I consider to be a very good sign, because that was not originally the plan, but there is already demand for it. So, I'm so far very happy with how the platform is performing. So, this is brand new. We have really just announced it towards the end of last week and we have notified the accounts, the 30 or so hedge funds that we have on the platform, we have invited them into this new service, High Touch Prime Brokerage service. The goal obviously is to attract hedge funds that are larger than, let's say, $100 million of equity, or to keep on our platform the ones that started small, but they have reached the assets level that would allow them to go to one of our larger competitors. So, we have done -- we have had a lot of discussions with the hedge funds, with some of the professionals at the prime brokerage space, and we have learned what the hedge funds -- the larger hedge funds expect of their prime broker. And number one thing that they expect is the white glove or a high touch service. So that is what this offering is. The eligible hedge fund will have single point of contact and will receive elevated service from Interactive Brokers. As part of the service, we are establishing a 24/5 Global Outsourced Trading Desk for these clients. These clients will get access to subject matter experts from various supporting functional groups, compliance, risk, funds and banking, securities finance and others. So, we believe that they will find what they usually expect from the large competing brokers. So, this was the first step that we are taking here, and over time, we will see how well it's working. We are continuously working on our electronic surveillance. As a broker, it is our obligation to surveil the trading activities and the movement of cash. We built our systems in-house, even though a lot of our competitors use third-party software. We looked at a few different third-party software packages that are available. We found them too expensive and not really suitable for us because our business is global. So that is why we decided a few years ago to build our own. And the system generates alerts, and the alerts are serviced by human operators which deem the alert either false positive or true positive. And if the alert points to a problem, then they either file a report with the regulator or they act according to the script that we have given to them. We have a significant number of operators that use this system and our goal is not to add more as the number of account increases, as the volumes increase, and as the cash moves increase. So that is the goal. And now, how we're going about it is continuously improving the platform, reducing the number of false positives, deploying some artificial intelligence techniques. So, that is what we have been doing for the past year or so. Similarly, on the customer service, our goal is not to have to grow the employees that work for the customer service department in proportion with the number of new accounts that we add. Now, how are we exactly accomplishing that is that we are making the service self-service. We are trying to reduce the number of phone calls our customer service department receives, the number of chats, the number of tickets, but by making it very easy or much easier for our clients to find self-help through the platform that we give them. And here again, we are using various techniques. Lately, we have dabbled into generative AI and we are seeing good results. But this is a process that will continue that we will always be working on. The first question was about who uses the AI capabilities that we have developed for customer service. It is both our customer service representative as well as our clients. When they ask a question through our platform, we map the question that is in natural language into the most suitable set of documents that have the ability to answer that question. And then, we apply some generative AI algorithms to the set of documents that we find, and we return an answer to the client. And something similar happens inside when the customer service representatives of Interactive Brokers uses the system. Now, as far as the trading using the AI, we do not yet have anything available for our clients in terms of the platform utilizing the AI, but we have discussions in-house and we have some, I believe, good ideas that we're going to be working on going forward. So, the headcount growth is easier to keep in check. In terms of the compensations, we have to deal with a couple of different factors. One of them is the inflation. Their lives are getting more expensive and we have to pay our employees more. And also the talent, the really good talent is getting more expensive. There are lots of tech and financial companies out there fighting for good talent, and we need to make sure that we keep the employees with Interactive Brokers and we are able to attract the new ones. And the recent historical trend has been such that the prices of the human resources have been going up. Well, every great tool can be misused and requires some amount of responsibility, if you will. The same can be said about one-day options. Now, what Thomas usually says when facing a question about zero-day options is that we have always had them. When you think back when only the monthly options were tradable on the expiration date, those options were zero-day options. Then the exchanges started listing weekly options, and then we had this event of an option becoming a zero-day option more frequent, and now we have them every day. So, it is not something that came out of nowhere. It's just -- there is a lot more of it available now. These options, CBOE has recently issued a document justifying their existence and reiterating the power and their use. And they have referred to the ability to hedge quickly, to ability to get into a position that is sensitive to a market move very quickly. So it is a good powerful tool. But as I have started in my paragraph, my answer, it can be misused. This is mostly about convenience, especially when you look at the Global Outsourced Trading Desk. We found that some hedge funds would like to take advantage of our ability to provide global products to them. They do not want to be up and trading at their desk 24 hours a day and they would welcome an opportunity to give us an order during the day, during the American day to work an order during Asian hours in Asian markets. That is what we are trying to outsource. So, obviously, we're going to charge a little more for that type of trading than the fully electronic self-trading. But it really is about the convenience. It is about attracting larger funds and keeping around the ones that started small, but grew big. Can it act as an accelerator? It absolutely can in the long run. Today, for a typical investor, it takes a while to decide what kind of a trade they want to do. There is usually some research involved, either fundamental or some technical analysis. Imagine in the future, you will have an AI engine available to you that is going to be able to quickly ask your question -- answer your questions, quickly do analysis for you, even recommend opportunities that you have -- you normally look at. So, I believe that is going to accelerate the trading in the future. And as to your other question, how are our traders -- our trading clients using the AI today, maybe they have their own tools, but at the moment, we are not offering any AI-based trading tools to them. But in the future, we're planning to. To tell you the truth, we do not look at it from the point of view of which client segment trades them the most for a very simple reason, it does not make a lot of a difference to us. We charge our public transparent commission to all segments the same way. So, for that reason, we are not really focusing on that. But I would tell you that just from reading newspapers out there, the zero dated options, they became a phenomenon that is participated on by the retail clients. So, I would say it's both the professionals and the retail. Thank you."

            "name": "Nancy Stuebe",
            "content": "Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining us today are Thomas Peterffy, our Founder and Chairman; Milan Galik, our President and CEO; and Paul Brody, our CFO. I will be presenting Milan's comments on the business, and all three will be available at our Q&A. As a reminder, today's call may include forward-looking statements, which represent the company's belief regarding future events, which by their nature are not certain and are outside of the company's control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in these forward-looking statements. We ask that you refer to the disclaimers in our press release. You should also review a description of risk factors contained in our financial reports filed with the SEC. This quarter, many of the same trends we saw in 2023 continued to play out. With market indexes on the rise worldwide and the popularity of investing growing, we see global interest from investors who increasingly want broad portfolios with some invested in securities in their home markets, but a more significant portion invested overseas, particularly in U.S. securities. Product wise, industry options contract volumes, both individual securities and 0DTE, were up as the popularity continued. Since the pandemic, average daily volume in OCC options has more than doubled from about 20 million contracts a day in 2019 to 40 million in 2022 and now a record 47.5 million in the first quarter. CME futures volumes, though down slightly from last year when investors were trading actively in the direction of interest rates, are up versus last quarter and meaningfully above pre-pandemic levels. And on the equities front, nearly every stock market around the world was up this quarter, with the exception of Hong Kong and China. This is a similar pattern to what we saw in 2023. The popularity of the Magnificent Seven technology names continues, which has meant that many investors hold on to their positions and are distinctly not looking to make any changes like selling them and buying new names. The Magnificent Seven are not gripping the index quite as firmly as last year when they represented 75% of the S&P 500's first quarter performance versus 43% in this quarter, but their stock price strength means investors have not needed to look elsewhere for gains. And as happened in 2023, industry equities volumes are down again as a result. What all of the above has meant for our business starts with strong account growth as we add more investors to our platform, both institutional and individual. In the first quarter, we added 184,000 new accounts, second only to the meme stock days of the first quarter 2021. We added in this one quarter twice the number of accounts we added in all of 2019. New accounts meant more cash in those accounts, which helped raise our client credit balances to a record $104.9 billion. Our client equity was up 36% to $466 billion, meaning we are approaching $0.5 trillion of client assets. Volume wise, we saw strong contract volumes in options, up 24% in the quarter and significantly ahead of the industry, and slightly weaker volumes in futures and equities, similar to the industry. However, rising equity markets have led clients to feel more comfortable with taking on risk, so they took on more assertive positions, which increased our exposure fee revenue, and took on more leverage to bolster their positions, increasing our margin loans, which exceeded $50 billion for the first time since 2021, and our margin interest income. This translated to strong financial results. Commission revenue was second only to the meme stock spike of the first quarter of 2021 and net interest income reached a record as did total revenues. We always focus on our expenses, meaning our pre-tax income also reached a record and our pre-tax profit margin remained at an industry leading 72%. In recognition of this and as a sign of our confidence in our business model and growth potential, we revisited the amount of dividend we pay and decided to increase it to $0.25 a quarter. We recognized that the dividend was unchanged since we initiated it at $0.10 in 2011, a time when we had 170,000 accounts, quarterly earnings of $222 million and capital of $4.4 billion. Today, we enjoy a strong capital position, which will allow us to be opportunistic in the M&A space should the right opportunity arise, but we would like to acknowledge our shareholders by returning some capital to them. In terms of how the business looked on the client front, our accounts and client equity grew fastest in Europe and Asia, similar to what I mentioned earlier, growing numbers of investors worldwide wanting access to international and particularly U.S. markets. Individuals saw the fastest account growth among our five client segments, with introducing brokers and proprietary traders close behind. On the client equity side, financial advisors grew the fastest, followed by individuals and i-brokers. Proprietary traders had the fastest commission growth, while net interest growth was led by introducing brokers, followed by hedge funds and individuals. Speaking of introducing brokers, our pipeline of potential clients remains healthy. There are several of these opportunities, about a couple dozen of them, at various stages. Some are in the testing stage. Others have started onboarding so called friends and family accounts where they test the waters and make sure that everything is working, while others are in the prospect stage to figure out what the optimal way for them to interface with us is. This can take time since we offer a variety of ways for an introducing broker to come onto our platform. On the one hand, it can be as simple as a broker white labeling our services, in which case the start up is very quick. On the other, it can be quite complex for i-brokers who want to have their own client-facing user interfaces, so they take longer to integrate with us. In between these two, there are many different setups with varying degrees of nuance and distinctions as the broker picks and chooses the level of integration and coupling that works best based on its needs and on what it is able to support in-house. In terms of new product introductions, we had a busy quarter. We are pleased to introduce our High Touch Prime Brokerage service, which we announced last week. Hedge funds in our High Touch program will have a dedicated relationship manager and direct access to subject matter experts as well as to an in-person 24/5 Global Outsourced Trading Desk. We consider the mission of the High Touch service to be \"find a way to yes\" for our clients' requests. For those hedge funds listening, I am sure there's a piece of your portfolio you could consider allocating to us. Regarding our platforms, we introduced IBKR Desktop, a streamlined, simpler-to-use, next-generation desktop trading application for Windows and Mac. IBKR Desktop is now sufficiently resource-rich, stable and available to our clients. We've added MultiSort Screeners, Option Analysis and other enhancements to name a few. For our flagship Trader Workstation, we added a multi-stock tax loss harvesting tool. And for IBKR Mobile, we engineered information architecture and navigation from the ground up. Our registered investment advisor clients got a host of new tools this quarter, including an improved Message Center, a reworked Advisor Portal menu with new features for managing contacts, accounts, and portfolios, and ways for the platform to assist with filing their Form ADVs. Automating substantial parts of the brokerage business for client success is the heart of what we do. There is much we are looking forward to and much work to be done as there always is and as every software developer will tell you. We are as busy as we've ever been and continue to see global demand for access to all markets. This trend and our ability to serve it with a much lower cost structure and a much broader product and toolset is what sets us apart and we'll continue to do so in the years ahead. With that, I will turn the call over to Paul Brody. Paul? Thank you everyone for participating today. As a reminder, this call will be available for replay on our website and we will also be posting a clean version of our transcript on the site tomorrow. Thank you again, and we will talk to you next quarter-end."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Paul Brody",
            "content": "Thank you, Nancy. Good afternoon, everyone. I will review the first quarter results and then, of course, we'll open it up for questions. Starting with our revenue items on Page 3 of the release, we're pleased with our financial results this quarter as we again produced record net revenues and pre-tax income. Commissions rose versus last year's first quarter, reaching $379 million. This quarter, we saw higher trading volumes from our growing base of active customers, particularly in options, which set a new quarterly volume record. Net interest income also reached a quarterly record of $747 million, reflecting a risk on environment in the quarter versus last year that led to more margin borrowing as well as higher yields on our margin loans and segregated cash portfolio. These are partially offset by the higher interest paid to our customers on their cash balances. Interactive Brokers passes through to them all rate hikes above the first 50 basis points on their qualified funds, which makes us attractive compared to other brokers and banks and competitive with money market funds. Other fees and services generated $59 million, up 37% from the prior year, driven by the risk on positioning of customers in the quarter. As we report in the financial highlights on Page 1 of our earnings release, the primary factor was an increase in risk exposure fees with a contribution from FDIC sweep fees as well. Other income includes gains and losses on our investments, our currency diversification strategy and principal transactions. Note that many of these non-core items are excluded in our adjusted earnings. Without these excluded items, other income was $31 million for the quarter. Turning to expenses, execution, clearing and distribution costs were $101 million in the quarter, up 6% over the year-ago quarter on higher volumes in options, which carry higher fees. As a percent of commission revenues, execution and clearing costs were 21% in the first quarter for a gross transactional profit margin of 79%. We calculate this by excluding from execution, clearing and distribution $21 million of non-transaction based costs, predominantly market data, which do not have a direct commission revenue component. Compensation and benefits expense was $145 million for the quarter, for a ratio of compensation expense to adjusted net revenues of 12%, down slightly from last year's quarter. We remain focused on expense discipline as reflected in our slowing the staff increase to 3% over the prior year. Our headcount at March 31 was 2,956. G&A expenses were $50 million, up from the year-ago quarter on higher advertising and legal expenses. Our pre-tax margin was 72% for the quarter. Income taxes of $71 million reflects the sum of the public company's $36 million and the operating company's $35 million. The public company's adjusted effective tax rate was 17.2%, within its usual range and similar to the prior year. Moving to our balance sheet on Page 5 of the release, the consistent strength of our business and our healthy balance sheet supports our raising the dividend from $0.40 per year to $1, returning capital to shareholders while still maintaining an ample capital base for the current business and future opportunities. Our total assets ended the quarter 11% higher at $132 billion with growth driven by margin lending to both new and existing customers. We continue to have no long-term debt. We maintain a balance sheet geared towards supporting growth in our existing business and helping us win new business by demonstrating our strength to prospective clients and partners. In our operating data, on Pages 6 and 7, our contract volumes in options for all customers rose 24% over the prior-year quarter, well above industry growth. Futures contract volumes and stock share volumes declined as they did across the industry. The decrease in stock share volume occurred in tandem with clients gravitating to larger, higher quality names with lower trading and pink sheet and other very low-priced stocks. In fact, despite the decline in share volume, the total notional value of brokerage shares traded was up in many markets, particularly in the U.S. On Page 7, you can see that total customer DARTs were 2.4 million trades per day, up 14% from the prior year, and especially strong in options followed by stocks and foreign exchange. Commission per -- cleared commissionable order of $2.93 was down from last year due to a mix of smaller average order sizes in stocks and options and larger in futures. Stocks and options contributed higher overall volumes but smaller average order sizes, while futures contributed lower volume with larger average order size. Page 8 shows our net interest margin numbers. Total GAAP net interest income was $747 million for the quarter, up 17%, while our NIM net interest income was $762 million, or $15 million higher. In the NIM computation, we include some income that for GAAP purposes is classified as other fees or other income, but we believe it's more appropriately considered interest. Our net interest income reflects strength in margin loan and segregated cash interest, partially offset by higher interest expense on customer cash balances. Most central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, held interest rates steady this quarter. Exceptions included a rate rise in Japan from negative 10 basis points to zero to positive 10 basis points, and a 25 basis point rate cut in the Swiss franc benchmark. Reflecting the rise in benchmark rates over the year, our segregated cash interest income rose 26% on a 2% increase in average balances, while margin loan interest rose by 42% on a 19% increase in average balances. The average duration of our portfolio remained at less than 30 days. With the U.S. dollar yield curve continuing to be inverted, we have been maximizing what we earn by focusing on higher short-term yields rather than accept the significantly lower yields of longer maturities. This strategy allows us to maintain a relatively tight maturity match between our assets and liabilities. Securities lending net interest has not been as strong as in prior quarters for three main reasons. First, throughout the industry, overall demand for shorting stocks has fallen. An extremely strong stock market, up in the U.S. nearly 30% in the past year and 10% in the first quarter alone means fewer people are looking to put on shorts when the overall market trend is so soundly upward. Second, there are fewer hard-to-borrow names industry-wide, not only because the overall market is rising sharply, but also due to weakness in some of the drivers relevant to securities lending, including significantly fewer IPOs, low market volatility, and less merger and acquisition activity. Finally, as noted on previous calls, higher average interest rates versus prior-year periods means more of what we earn from securities lending is classified as interest on segregated cash. To more accurately compare our securities lending revenue with last year, we estimate that if the additional interest earned on cash collateral were reported under securities borrowed and loaned, it would have been $12 million higher or $38 million. Interest on customer credit balances, the interest we pay to our customers on the cash in their account, rose on both higher rates in nearly all currencies and higher balances from new account growth. As we have noted many times in the past, the high interest rates we pay on customer cash, currently 4.83% on qualified U.S. dollar balances, is a significant driver of new customers. Fully rate-sensitive customer balances were about $18.5 billion this quarter versus $17.2 billion in the year-ago quarter, and firm equity, most of which consists of interest-earning assets, increased 20% over the prior year. Now, for our estimates of the impact of changes in rates. Given market expectations of rate cuts sometime in 2024, we estimate the effect of a 25 basis point decrease in the benchmark Fed funds rate to be a $58 million reduction in annual net interest income. Note that our starting point for this estimate is March 31, with the Fed fund's effective rate at 5.33% and balances as of that date. Any growth in our balance sheet and interest-earning assets would reduce this impact. About 25% of our customer cash balances is not in U.S. dollars, so estimates of a U.S. rate change exclude those currencies. We estimate the effective decreases in all of the relevant non-USD benchmark rates would reduce annual net interest income by $18 million for each 25 basis point decrease in those benchmarks. At a high level, a full 1% decrease in all the benchmark rates would decrease our annual net interest income by about $304 million. This takes into account rate-sensitive customer balances and firm equity. In conclusion, we started the year with another financially strong quarter in net revenues and pre-tax margin, reflecting our continued ability to grow our customer base and deliver on our core value proposition to customers while scaling the business. We raised our dividend in recognition of our financial strength. Our business strategy continues to be effective, automating as much of the brokerage business as possible and expanding what we offer while minimizing what we charge. With that, I'll turn it over to the moderator, and we'll open up the line for questions. Yeah, sure. So, as usual, there's a baseline that grows as our customer base grows. Having said that, that baseline on the short side has been retreating over the last quite a number of months now across the industry, less interest in shorting stocks. So, that's on the one side. And then on the other, really, where we do quite well in lending stocks that are in great demand, the shorts drive that as well because we can only lend it to other people who are going short, so that tends to go down. And we've built great tools for recognizing what the rate should be and taking advantage of them to the best we can. But there are only so many opportunities out there in the market and there really haven't been any extremely hot stocks, if you will, very high, hard-to-borrow rate stocks, and that drives the business as well. So, those will come and go. And when they show up, we have the tools to make the most of it. Right. To the second question first, yes, it's a shift. Sometimes we invest our house capital in instruments that don't generate interest from a GAAP accounting standpoint and they end up being reported in other income. So, yes to that point. And also yes to trading activities produced a better result this year than certainly in last year's quarter and somewhat better than in the fourth quarter as well. So, we're not unhappy with our very small remaining market making operations. Yeah. We operate in India and in Hong Kong."
