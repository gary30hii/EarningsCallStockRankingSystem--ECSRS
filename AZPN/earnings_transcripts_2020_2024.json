Also, please note that the following information relates to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, August 12, 2020. Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. The structure of today's call will be as follows: Antonio will discuss business highlights from the fourth quarter; and then I will review our financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal year 2021. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Thank you, Karl, and thank you all for joining us today. We hope all of you and your families are staying safe and healthy. Today, we're also celebrating AspenTech's 39th anniversary of its founding. AspenTech delivered solid fourth quarter results against one of the most uncertain economic environments we have experienced in our 39-year history. By utilizing AspenTech solutions, our customers were able to adapt quickly to unexpected and challenging circumstances, while continuing to operate their assets safely and efficiently. Our customers faced an unprecedented demand disruption in our fiscal fourth quarter, and we thank them for their continued trust in the AspenTech team and our products and solutions. We believe this illustrates the mission-critical nature of AspenTech as well as the resiliency of our operating and financial model. Our performance was made possible by the hard work and dedication of everybody on the AspenTech team who remain focused on our customer success from the very beginning of the pandemic amidst challenging circumstances. Looking quickly at our financial results for the fourth quarter, revenue was $199.3 million, GAAP EPS was $1.43 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.54. Annual spend was $593 million, up 3.1% in the quarter and 9.6% year-over-year, and free cash flow was $99.5 million. For the full year, total revenue was $590.2 million, GAAP EPS was $3.28 and non-GAAP EPS was $3.72. Free cash flow was $243.1 million, and we returned $150 million to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 1.3 million shares. While we were pleased with our performance in the quarter, our results reflect the impact of the economic downturn related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have seen conditions in our end markets, showed some improvements in the late March-April timeframe, but our customers continue to operate in uncertain and challenging market conditions. In the energy sector, we had a good quarter with some notable wins amongst refining customers. Oil prices have stabilized by the end of the quarter from their trough in early May and are recently trading around the $40 per barrel level as supply cuts took effect and demand showed signs of improvement. Increased economic activity and automobile use in the May trough has resulted in improved fuel demand, creating a more stable operating environment in refining, driven by an increase in utilization rate, albeit still well below pre-COVID levels. Reduced air and ground travel levels are likely to persist at least in the near term, which could limit further improvements in end market demand. We also had a solid quarter with chemicals customers. This is a sector where some companies benefit and others are impacted from the significant changes in product demand patterns. Sometimes even in business units within the same company. The customer has been adversely impacted, are adjusting their operations and operating expenses to reflect current and near-term demand levels. We're anticipating a slower than expected recovery in economic activity in the second half of this calendar year, which will prolong the recovery for the chemicals industry. Despite the tough operating conditions for our owner-operator customers in the refining and chemicals markets, in each case, we continue to see solid adoption of our products and solutions, as well as growth in our pipeline of business. Customers in these markets recognize that digitalization and automation are areas in which they most continue to invest. We have heard this repeatedly in the last five months during customer meetings and from the membership of our Executive Advisory Board. These customers will require technology that allows them to run their plants more efficiently with more agility and in a more sustainable and safer fashion. We strongly believe that the macro disruption created by the pandemic further underscores this trend and the opportunity for expanded usage of our product suites. The engineering and construction market experienced further backlog declines as its customers reduced global CapEx budgets and delayed final investment decisions or slowed down projects, although the resumption of construction activity in many jurisdictions in the last two, three months, has been a positive development. We generated modest growth from this vertical in the quarter, driven by a combination of transactions in North America and Europe and a strong contribution from Russia. We believe there are growth opportunities from these customers as they continue to look for productivity improvements in their engineering teams and their design activities and shift their focus to operations and maintenance activities in brownfield operations. Overall, we are pleased with the solid performance of both the engineering and MSC suites in the quarter. The MSC suite delivered, especially strong performance and the engineering suite generated good growth despite the challenges faced in the engineering and construction industry. The APM suite delivered a record quarter, the largest quarter in its history. We signed some exciting transactions in the quarter that highlight the opportunity for APM to drive new value creation opportunities for customers across all industries. Key transactions were signed with customers in mining, engineering and construction, pulp and paper, refining, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and specialty chemicals. At the same time, we had a number of APM transactions that were delayed as customers adjusted their operations to current conditions. APM is an emerging set of technologies, which makes it easier for some prospective customers to delay purchasing decisions as part of their near-term cost-saving initiatives. We remain very encouraged by the breadth of APM pipeline activity and are confident we will see improved performance as the economy normalizes. Today, the APM suite is being used by 103 customers in 33 different countries and we have the largest pipeline of business in the young history of this suite. Following are highlights of some of the transactions signed in the quarter. First, a European oil and gas company that also produces low-carbon energy and is a long-time customer of AspenTech's MSC suite, signed a global enterprise agreement for AspenTech's multivariable control technology, DMC3. This customer is committed to a net zero greenhouse emissions target by 2050, as part of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and identified multivariable process control as one of the key enabling technologies that will contribute to meet its objective. Aspen DMC3 was selected to be standardized across all refining operations over competing offerings due to our clear market leadership in process control. Second, a Europe-based global E&C company, focused on the asset life cycle of its end-user customers across many industries, once again, renewed its agreement with AspenTech and increased spend by licensing our APM suite. This customer conducted an evaluation of multiple software technology suppliers and selected AspenTech for its broad-ranging vision and leading market position. This company expects to become a digitalization partner to our joint customers, and plans to promote and implement our APM suite as part of expanding relationships in the operations and maintenance space. Third and final, a leading global chemical company in Japan and long-term customer of AspenTech, selected Aspen Mtell to improve maintenance operations as part of its corporate digitalization transformation initiative. The customer evaluated technology from seven local and foreign companies and selected our product after the result of a proof-of-concept pilot. The initial deployment will be at one site in Japan with the expectation of an enterprise rollout in the future. We also had a solid quarter of profitability and free cash flow. We believe the strength of our balance sheet and financial model, together with our operating discipline is a significant competitive advantage during difficult market cycles. We have the resources and flexibility to continue investing in our core growth initiatives, which further extends our product market leadership. I would now like to provide you with some additional details about our performance for the full year 2020. From a product perspective, the engineering business grew annual spend 5.4% for the year; generating 33.4% of our overall annual spend growth. Our manufacturing and supply chain or MSC business continued to perform at a high level, delivering annual spend growth of 12.7%, representing 49.5% of our total annual spend growth. The combined engineering and MSC businesses came in the middle of the range of the original guidance given for the fiscal year of 7 to 9 points of growth contribution from those two suites. The Asset Performance Management or APM business, generated total annual spend growth of over 64% or 17.1% of our total annual spend growth for annual spend growth for the year, contributing 1.7 points of annual spend growth. We think the positive contribution and strong gross growth of our three suites speaks to the multiple growth levers in our business. At the end of the year, our installed base of business was split 58% engineering and 38% MSC, with APM at 4% on an annual spend basis. Our three core verticals of energy, chemicals and engineering and construction contributed 37.7%, 34.3% and 18% of our growth in annual spend during the year, respectively. One of the trends we're also pleased with is our performance in the global economy industries or GEIs, which contributed 10% of our annual spend growth for the year with the pharmaceuticals industry included in this segment and growing 19.7% in the year. The success of the GEIs is a positive indicator of the opportunity with the APM suite and the potential for further end-market diversification. At the end of fiscal year 2020, the energy vertical represented 41% of our business; chemicals 28%; E&Cs 25%; and GEIs, including pharma, 6%. An important trend to note is that over the last six years, more of our business has shifted away from the E&C industry, now representing 25% of our annual spend from 31% at the end of fiscal year 2014, while we have continued to grow and create significant value for our shareholders. For the full year, our attrition rate was 4.2%. We were pleased with the trends in attrition in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. It is important to recognize that we generated 13.8% gross growth for the year. This is growth prior to attrition. Turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2021. We entered the year still facing uncertainty in our core end-markets. Positively, we continue to have a strong pipeline across all three of our product suites and significant customer interest in newer solutions like APM, GDOT and Aspen Enterprise Insights. This encouraging demand trends reflect in part the strategic importance of digitalization investments in the process and other capital-intensive industries. Based on our fourth quarter results, which we felt could be a good barometer for the rest of the calendar year and current visibility into the business, our expectations of how the macro environment will impact our business in fiscal year 2021 have shifted since early May. We are now projecting gross growth to be double-digit again. Our expectation for attrition is marginally higher than our original expectation in the range of 5% to 6%, though, as I noted, we remain confident it will not reach the peak from the previous cycle. The year-over-year increase in attrition reflects a worsened economic environment, particularly for E&C customers and recognizes that we have a larger than usual amount of business up for renewal this fiscal year. As we discussed at length on our last earnings call, while we expect attrition to increase from fiscal year 2020 levels, there are several factors that gives us confidence that attrition will not reach the highs that we experienced during the last cycle. Please note that we expect attrition to be somewhat evenly distributed across all four quarters of the year and anticipate growth will follow our historical seasonality, with the majority of the sequential growth in our business occurring in the second half of the fiscal year. Taking all this into account, we are targeting annual spend growth of 6% to 9% in fiscal year 2021, underlying this guidance, it's an expectation that our core engineering and MSC suites will grow in the 4% to 7% range, and APM will contribute approximately 2 points of growth. The resiliency demonstrated by our business in fiscal year 2020 gives us confidence to continue investing in our key strategic priorities in fiscal year 2021. We announced one of our top investment priorities today with the introduction of our new AIoT Hub that is a result of the integration of recent investments in Industry 4.0 digital capabilities, including the acquisitions of RtTech, Sabisu and Mnubo. It will also include our process industries leading data historian InfoPlus.21 and related capabilities. This new AIoT Hub will focus on data, connectivity, edge and cloud capabilities, visualization and insights and provide a cloud-ready environment for our next-generation hybrid AI products and solutions. The Hub enables, seamless and flexible data mobility and integration across the enterprise from sensors to the edge and cloud, and accelerate the delivery of business insights for the capital-intensive industries. A key focus for the AIoT solutions organization will be to grow the installed base of our IP.21 historian by expanding access to data at the enterprise level, as our customers increase their use of data to deploy our high-value applications and those of third parties using the Hub cloud-ready capabilities. We are very excited about the opportunity for the AIoT Hub, and believe it will further reposition and strengthen AspenTech in the rapidly-expanding segment of Industry 4.0 digital capabilities. We will also be releasing later this year the newest version of the aspenONE suite, which kicks off the introduction of a new generation of software products with hybrid modeling capabilities that will leverage the AIoT Hub for their delivery. Hybrid modeling will combine AI algorithms and capabilities directly with first principle's domain knowledge and expertise in our current software products to significantly advance accuracy and responsiveness without the need for customers to invest in expensive armies of data scientists. We will also expand our investments in APM to increase market coverage and best position this suite to benefit from the improvement in the macro environment over time. In addition, we will materially increase investments in sales capacity for the GEI markets to capitalize on the opportunity we see in those verticals. We look forward to discussing all these and more during our Annual Investor Day, which will be held in November. As Karl will detail later, we are forecasting another strong year of profitability and free cash flow generation in fiscal year 2021, which is supported by our operating discipline and growth outlook. In addition, we will be resuming our stock repurchase program. Our board of directors recently authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of stock this fiscal year. We believe our ability to consistently return capital to shareholders throughout the business cycle is evidence of the strength and stability of our business. To conclude, I'm as excited as I've ever been about the outlook for AspenTech. While the current macroeconomic environment is challenging, there are many factors that support long-term growth for the business. The introduction of the AIoT Hub and the innovations that will be delivered in our new software release will further reinforce the value our mission-critical solutions have generated for customers for nearly 40 years and uniquely position AspenTech to again lead the next transformation of the process industries. We believe the recovery from the current economic macro conditions will create the right environment for the company to get back to sustainable double-digit growth in the future. I'm confident in our ability to execute in these challenging times and to generate value for our shareholders over the years to come. Now, let me turn the call over to Karl. Karl?\nKarl Eric Johnsen - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Thanks, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the fourth quarter fiscal 2020. As a reminder, these results are being reported under Topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings, and more specifically, renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years and this non-linearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods. In our view, annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business, and annual free cash flow, the most important metric for assessing the overall value our business generates. Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all our current invoices for our term license agreements at the end of each period was approximately $593 million at the end of the fourth quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 9.6% on a year-over-year basis and 3.1%, sequentially. Total Contract Value, or TCV, which we define as the aggregate value of all payments received or to be received under all active term license agreements, including maintenance and escalation. We believe the TCV metric gives insight into the scale of our overall business. As of June 30, 2020, the total contract value was $2.76 billion. This compares to $2.57 billion at June 30, 2019. Total bookings, which we define as the total value of customer term license contracts signed in the current period less the value of term license contracts signed in the current period but where the initial licenses are not yet deemed delivered under Topic 606 plus term license contracts signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period was $236.2 million, a 2% decrease year-over-year. Total bookings in fiscal year 2020 were $610.1 million, a 6% decrease year-over-year. This decrease in the quarter and for the year was the result of a lower amount of renewal bookings for each period, versus the comparable year-ago period. As a reminder, the timing of renewal bookings is not an indicator of our growth or health of our company. Overall, we were pleased with our bookings' performance in the quarter, which reflected solid demand across all three product suites and attrition that was in line with our expectations. Total revenue was $199.3 million for the fourth quarter, a 1.8% increase from the prior-year period. Turning to profitability, beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $70.5 million compared to $69.1 million in the year-ago period. Total expenses, including cost of revenue were $85.6 million, which was up from $84.5 million in the year-ago period, and down from $85.9 million last quarter. Operating income was $113.7 million, and net income for the quarter was $97.6 million, or $1.43 per share. Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition-related fees, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter of $122.9 million, representing a 61.7% non-GAAP operating margin, compared to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $119.9 million and 61.3%, respectively in the year-ago period. As a reminder, operating margin is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings and recognition of license revenue which is typically highest in the fourth quarter. We believe focusing on annual free cash flow as a percentage of annual spend is the most appropriate way to assess the efficiency of our performance in a period. Non-GAAP net income was $104.9 million, or $1.54 per share based on 68.2 million shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $287.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $431.2 million outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility. We did not repurchase any stock in the fourth quarter and completed $150 million of stock buybacks during the fiscal year. In the fourth quarter, we generated $99.7 million of cash from operations and $99.5 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software, and acquisition-related payments. Our cash flow performance was generally in line with our expectations, but did reflect lower-than-usual cash collection, as some customers were more cautious in managing their cash flow given the current macro environment. We had approximately $18 million of receivables due June 30 that were not collected until the first few weeks of July. Overall, we have not seen any material changes in contract or billing terms, or the collectability of our receivables since the pandemic began. For the full year 2020, we generated $243.3 million of cash from operations and $243.1 million of free cash flow. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables within our press release, which is available on our website. I would now like to close with guidance. Consistent with fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we will be providing guidance on an annual basis. This year, we will also be providing renewal bookings on a quarterly basis to provide better insight into the quarterly cadence of our revenue. We expect bookings in the range of $770 million to $850 million, which includes $519 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal year 2021. This includes $81 million of contracts up for renewal in the first quarter. From a linearity perspective, we currently anticipate 40% to 45% of fiscal year 2021 bookings coming in the first-half of the year with the remainder in the second-half. With respect to annual spend growth, as Antonio mentioned, we are now forecasting 6% to 9% annual spend growth. In terms of timing, we would expect the linearity of sequential growth to be similar to recent years. This means the majority of our annual spend growth will occur in the second-half of the fiscal year. We expect revenue in the range of $704 million to $754 million. We expect license revenue in the range of $485 million to $534 million, and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $192 million and $28 million, respectively. From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $372 million to $377 million. Taken together, we expect GAAP operating income in the range of $332 million to $377 million for fiscal 2021, with GAAP net income of approximately $290 million to $327 million. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $4.29 to $4.83. From a non-GAAP perspective, we now expect non-GAAP operating income of $374 million to $420 million and non-GAAP income per share in the range of $4.78 and $5.32. From a free cash flow perspective, we now expect $260 million to $270 million. Our fiscal 2021 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments in the range of $60 million to $70 million. To wrap up, our performance in the fourth quarter and our outlook for fiscal 2021 demonstrates AspenTech's ability to generate solid growth and profitability in trying circumstances. We are focused on continuing to deliver significant value to our customers and investing in the next-generation of products that will provide additional ways to improve the performance of their assets. With that, we would now like to begin the Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Certainly. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Your question please.\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Hi, Matt.\nMatthew Pfau - William Blair & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, wanted to start off with, when I look at the 2021 guidance and, specifically, around annual spend, maybe you can just help us understand what sort of macro impacts are factored into that, and just sort of a recovery then in the back half of your fiscal year factored in and necessary to come within that guidance range?\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Well, I mean, look, again, and this is a little bit back to what we saw in Q4, and that we continue to have good conversations with customers. But at the same time, we recognize the environment that these customers are operating in. The uncertainty around how economic growth is going to develop over the next two, three quarters based on the resolution or not of the pandemic. But what you see in our guidance is, again, a solid performance from our MSC suite. Certainly, an engineering business that will reflect increased attrition. But as you saw, we're guiding that to 5% to 6% from 4.2%, and an APM business that should perform in line or better than it did in fiscal year 2020, from a standpoint of point of growth contribution. The range is just a reflection of, I think, that uncertainty that we see, but also the positive conversations that we're seeing at the high-end of the attrition is associated with the low-end of our growth guidance and vice versa, and perhaps a little bit less gross growth from the engineering business that what we saw in fiscal year 2020. And while we hope the MSC business will perform at the same level, we also would expect perhaps a little bit of a slowdown in gross growth in that business. But overall, 6% to 9% is a range that we're very comfortable with for the fiscal year.\nMatthew Pfau - William Blair & Co. LLC: Got it. And one more for me. Just maybe you can give us a little bit more detail on how you're investing in sales capacity in the GEI industries. Are these resources dedicated to specific industries within GEI? And then your current GEI business, what's the split between direct or partner stores?\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Yeah. So yes, we do have, and we've talked about different industries in the past on GEIs. We've sort of pivoted away from a couple of them, power and water, I think water \u2013 forget the name exactly of it. But certainly, mining is core to our activities there. You can expect us to do more in pharmaceuticals. We believe there's also an opportunity in food and beverage. And there's one or two others that we're looking at. We'll give you much more clarity, uncertainty on exactly the industries that we're now going to be focusing on come the November Investor Day. But just know that we believe there's an opportunity there. We see it. And we're going to put more sales resources into these industries going forward.\nMatthew Pfau - William Blair & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: And Matt, the other part of your question direct versus indirect. Certainly, we're seeing good traction from indirect but based on what we're seeing, we also feel that we need to step in with our own direct sales organization into some of these industries, and that's where our investment will go into.\nMatthew Pfau - William Blair & Co. LLC: Thanks, Antonio. Appreciate it.\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Yeah. No problem, Matt. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader from JPMorgan. Your question please.\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Hi, Jack.\nJackson E. Ader - JPMorgan: Thanks. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So the MSC suite, really strong growth this year, and it sounds like another outlook for 2021 is calling for more growth. I think that's just surprising on the upside, given the pressure that we're seeing from refiners and chemicals customers. So what's kind of \u2013 what's driving this growth?\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Look, just \u2013 and we've always said that in a way, as economic \u2013 the macro environment margins get tightened and demand suffers for these customers, they focus more and more on efficiencies, on flexibility, on agility and that's what our products do. I told this story to investors during the sort of the call back that we had with you, all of you in May and June, one of the largest global chemical companies been using our multivariable control technology to drive more throughput through their units, their ethylene crackers and their propylene plants prior to COVID. Of course, with the demand destruction, the objective was no longer increased throughput through those plants. They shifted the objective function for our controllers to drive-in a stability in the plants, operational stability to drive-in better quality in their products. And this Executive Vice President was so excited because they could do this and sort of drive that sort of flexibility, have that sort of flexibility in our technology. So this is what we do. Look, our technology is not only to be used during a steady state and growth environment. As you can adjust the economic function of our products and to whatever objectives you're trying to accomplish. Supply chains get disrupted. Our supply chain solutions can be used to re-plan refineries, to optimize distribution logistics across multiple plants for demand and supply. So, this is what we do. And in a way, the conversations we've had since this all happened are much more real, and we expect they will continue to be. For a couple of years, we've said that digitalization is becoming front-and-center for this industry that we're in the early stages of technology adoption and automation. And we believe those trends will only accelerate going forward.\nJackson E. Ader - JPMorgan: Okay. That makes sense. A follow-up question, Karl for you on cash flow. If we normalize, maybe for that $18 million of cash that ended up being collected in July versus June kind of looks like flattish free cash flow between what you're expecting in 2021 versus 2020. With everything else looking, like it's going to grow. What's the main driver of that kind of flat normalized cash flow growth?\nKarl Eric Johnsen - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Yes. So there's probably two pieces to it. One is, that $18 million, that's probably about a 3, 4 day increase in our DSO and we're carrying that forward. Just assuming that, that dynamic will hold for the year. So it's a little bit of that playing into it. But then also, you've got cash taxes are up considerably next year. Part of that is there's a little bit of \u2013 about $7.5 million of that is for catch up for Topic 605 adoption that we've been paying, you're allowed to pay over 3 years. So a little bit of that too. So I think if you look at those two pieces, that gives you your answer. And I think the collections are right in line with what we'd expect with that slight bump in the DSO and then the cash taxes.\nJackson E. Ader - JPMorgan: Got you. All right, makes sense, thank you.\nKarl Eric Johnsen - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Yeah.\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird. Your question please.\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Hi, Rob.\nRob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi, great, thanks. Hi, Antonio. Hi, Karl. Thanks for taking my question. A couple. Just to start, I wanted to ask about the APM business, solid guidance and strong year-over-year growth. Could you maybe talk a little bit, Antonio, about how that selling environment may have evolved throughout the back half of the year for you guys? I know going back to January; there were some deals that were delayed even prior to China and COVID and you were pretty confident those deals were going to close. It sounds like there's still some deals that are being held up or maybe just for longer sales cycles. So can you maybe just talk a little bit about that environment and how that may have changed throughout the quarter or what you're seeing right now? And then I have one follow-up.\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Okay. Well, I mean, Rob, I think throughout last year, and especially the first half of the year, we maintained that really most of our growth was going to come in in Q3, Q4. We were prepared to deliver in my opinion a fantastic Q3 quarter until basically March 8 hit. And we did what we did in Q3. Our performance in Q4 on APM is just a reflection of what we felt was going to be the second half of fiscal 2020, which were going to prove the breakout capacity of our APM business. It was a record quarter for APM in Q4. The fact is that, it could have been even better, but certainly some customers that were looking at the technology to sign up for it for the first time hesitated. We had some good medium-large deals where customers at the very end decided to delay their decision. So we've explained that in the prepared remarks, it's an emerging set of technologies. And in a way, it's an easy decision to delay investment in something like that. But we're also very confident about the suite and the technologies in the suite is being validated by customers. We did some sizable deals in the quarter. And look, while it's hard to be patient. As the economic environment recovers, we'll see APM come back and give us opportunity to provide its breakout capacity. At the same time, like you said, fiscal year 2020, we're guiding for what I believe and we believe is solid guidance, solid growth in the context of the uncertainty and macro that we're seeing, and we'll go from there.\nRob Oliver - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. That's helpful. And then just one very quick follow-up on that 2021 attrition guide. Is that going to be more skewed towards any one particular vertical as you guys look at the renewal profile of the large renewals that you guys have this year? Thanks very much. Appreciate it, guys.\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Yeah. No. I mean, look, of course, a lot of it will come out of the engineering suite, the E&C vertical. We'll probably see some attrition as well in the energy vertical. But I think it will follow the historical pattern associated with the downturn that we saw in 2015 and 2016, not to the same level that it did back then, but certainly same pattern, same profile. That's what we expect.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc. Your question please?\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Hi, Jason.\nJason Celino - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Antonio, Karl, thanks for taking the question. Good to get all the color. As you talked about your APM pipeline, I think you mentioned it was the biggest pipe that you've seen so far. How much of this confidence is maybe due to enterprise deals? Or is it just the number of opportunities?\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, Jason, that's a good point. I mean, when we started talking about the APM pipeline three years ago, it was all sort of first-time deals in the pipeline. Now the pipeline also has much larger deals, enterprise-type deals based on the fact that we now have some customers that have been using the technology for one or two years, and we've been expanding into more sites, and we're having conversations with some of these customers about doing an enterprise transaction. So we did that with one of our customers in Q4 in one of the GEI industries. And our expectation is that we're going to have an opportunity to do more of those in the future.\nJason Celino - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Okay. And then one more APM question, if I can. So this is maybe the first downturn relative to when this new technology was developed. But relative to your competitors, have you noticed any change in competition? Are they doing maybe as well as you're doing, and that's reflective of more the market? Or any other commentary you can provide?\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Yeah. I mean, look, we only worry about the competition when we're competing against them head-to-head. Otherwise, they have to worry about their own business. What we see when in head-to-head competition is that we continue to hold our own. One of the vignettes talked about this Japanese customer evaluating seven technology providers and selecting AspenTech. By the way, we also have some of the global consulting and global implementation companies now. Not only partnering with AspenTech, but actually making APM and the Mtell product exclusive in their go-to-market activities with their own customers through the conviction that they are seeing in the market about the product. So the business continues to build, including the ecosystem around the APM suite and the Mtell product. So, this is all part of the success that I believe we continue to have with APM.\nJason Celino - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. I'll get back in queue.\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew DeGasperi from Berenberg. Your question, please.\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew DeGasperi - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one on the deals that you said last quarter that were being delayed. Just wondering how many of those did they close in Q4, given the strong quarter? Or were some potentially delayed beyond this quarter into next year?\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Yes. No. I mean, look, some of the deals from Q3 closed in Q4. Some of them, sort of, crossed all of Q4, and they're now in Q1. There were some deals in Q4 that closed in Q4 and some deals in Q4 that moved out of Q4. In a way, what the last three weeks of March did was push the pipeline into the future. But the opportunities haven't disappeared. It's just that they all got pushed into the future. And we closed some of that in Q4, and now it's in fiscal year 2021. But, look, it's \u2013 like, we said in the prepared remarks, it's an emerging technology, there has to be a strong conviction by customers to spend the money. We're asking them to spend in the middle of this uncertainty. And some customers are pulling the trigger and others are deciding to sort of delay. But overall, we are happy. Look, it's a suite; it's a product that grew year-on-year, 64%. Yes, it didn't grow what we had hoped it would grow, but 64%, I still think is pretty decent in the context of everything that was going on in the last four months of our fiscal year.\nAndrew DeGasperi - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC: That's helpful. And then, if I may, on the guidance for next fiscal year. I was wondering how conservative it would be, given the current economic environment. I mean, I think in the past, you mentioned that oil generally being below $50 per barrel for a sustainable amount of time was a negative, but it doesn't seem to be the case with this annual spend guidance. And I'm wondering are you baking in some significant improvement in execution versus the Q4 quarter?\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Well, let me look at \u2013 we gave a range of 6% to 9%. And again, we're not oblivious to the challenges in the market. But at the same time, Q4, if you look at the earnings result from our customers after \u2013 in the last few weeks, you could see how it was one of the most challenging quarters they've ever faced financially, and they still \u2013 we still saw the commitment to continue to drive efficiencies in their business. So while we are cognizant of the macro environment that reigns in out there, we also saw good traction with our customers and the implementation of our products. So that's why you have the range that you have. It's a wider range than we've ever given. But we've done a lot of analysis around our business, and well, we gave you the range that we gave you because we believe in it.\nAndrew DeGasperi - Berenberg Capital Markets LLC: Great. Thanks, Antonio.\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel from Benchmark. Your question please.\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Hi, Mark.\nMark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Hi. How are you doing? Thank you for taking my question. Just one, Antonio, with respect to APM, in the past, you've talked about incumbency being important to winning new deals or winning new business. I was wondering if you had any meaningful deal wins in the quarter where you weren't the incumbent?\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Well, no, look, actually, quite a bit. And when you talk about the GEI industries, that's the case, when you talk about mining, when you talk about pulp and paper, even specialty chemicals and other places. Now when we talk about energy and chemicals, incumbency from a standpoint that it's a customer of AspenTech, not incumbency in that, there's already some APM product in there. But certainly, the fact that we have a long time existing relationships gives us a leg up against the competition, but we're proven that we can go into other industries and equally show success with the APM suite. So, this is why we're stepping up our investment in our sales organization for the GEIs, and more to come on that when we do our Investor Day in November.\nMark W. Schappel - The Benchmark Co. LLC: Great. Thank you.\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Antonio Pietri for any further remarks.\nAntonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.: Yeah. Thank you. Look, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. I just want to take a minute to also thank the AspenTech team. Again, I believe they did a tremendous job pivoting in early April to apply the learnings that we gain from the 2015, 2016 downturn and the leadership they demonstrated. I think our Q4 results should be further proof of the financial model and operating resiliency of this business. I know there were a lot of questions from investors during the call backs in May and June about the resiliency of our business in the face of everything that was going on. I hope we've proven that our business has a resiliency to it that is real. And furthermore, that behind the scenes, over the last four, five years, we've worked to transform our organization, the execution, how we lead, and I believe what we achieved in Q4 and fiscal year 2020 is a reflection of that. And well, fiscal year 2021 is ahead of us. So, thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Antonio Jose Pietri - Aspen Technology, Inc.",
            "content": "Thank you, Karl, and thank you all for joining us today. We hope all of you and your families are staying safe and healthy. Today, we're also celebrating AspenTech's 39th anniversary of its founding. AspenTech delivered solid fourth quarter results against one of the most uncertain economic environments we have experienced in our 39-year history. By utilizing AspenTech solutions, our customers were able to adapt quickly to unexpected and challenging circumstances, while continuing to operate their assets safely and efficiently. Our customers faced an unprecedented demand disruption in our fiscal fourth quarter, and we thank them for their continued trust in the AspenTech team and our products and solutions. We believe this illustrates the mission-critical nature of AspenTech as well as the resiliency of our operating and financial model. Our performance was made possible by the hard work and dedication of everybody on the AspenTech team who remain focused on our customer success from the very beginning of the pandemic amidst challenging circumstances. Looking quickly at our financial results for the fourth quarter, revenue was $199.3 million, GAAP EPS was $1.43 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.54. Annual spend was $593 million, up 3.1% in the quarter and 9.6% year-over-year, and free cash flow was $99.5 million. For the full year, total revenue was $590.2 million, GAAP EPS was $3.28 and non-GAAP EPS was $3.72. Free cash flow was $243.1 million, and we returned $150 million to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 1.3 million shares. While we were pleased with our performance in the quarter, our results reflect the impact of the economic downturn related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have seen conditions in our end markets, showed some improvements in the late March-April timeframe, but our customers continue to operate in uncertain and challenging market conditions. In the energy sector, we had a good quarter with some notable wins amongst refining customers. Oil prices have stabilized by the end of the quarter from their trough in early May and are recently trading around the $40 per barrel level as supply cuts took effect and demand showed signs of improvement. Increased economic activity and automobile use in the May trough has resulted in improved fuel demand, creating a more stable operating environment in refining, driven by an increase in utilization rate, albeit still well below pre-COVID levels. Reduced air and ground travel levels are likely to persist at least in the near term, which could limit further improvements in end market demand. We also had a solid quarter with chemicals customers. This is a sector where some companies benefit and others are impacted from the significant changes in product demand patterns. Sometimes even in business units within the same company. The customer has been adversely impacted, are adjusting their operations and operating expenses to reflect current and near-term demand levels. We're anticipating a slower than expected recovery in economic activity in the second half of this calendar year, which will prolong the recovery for the chemicals industry. Despite the tough operating conditions for our owner-operator customers in the refining and chemicals markets, in each case, we continue to see solid adoption of our products and solutions, as well as growth in our pipeline of business. Customers in these markets recognize that digitalization and automation are areas in which they most continue to invest. We have heard this repeatedly in the last five months during customer meetings and from the membership of our Executive Advisory Board. These customers will require technology that allows them to run their plants more efficiently with more agility and in a more sustainable and safer fashion. We strongly believe that the macro disruption created by the pandemic further underscores this trend and the opportunity for expanded usage of our product suites. The engineering and construction market experienced further backlog declines as its customers reduced global CapEx budgets and delayed final investment decisions or slowed down projects, although the resumption of construction activity in many jurisdictions in the last two, three months, has been a positive development. We generated modest growth from this vertical in the quarter, driven by a combination of transactions in North America and Europe and a strong contribution from Russia. We believe there are growth opportunities from these customers as they continue to look for productivity improvements in their engineering teams and their design activities and shift their focus to operations and maintenance activities in brownfield operations. Overall, we are pleased with the solid performance of both the engineering and MSC suites in the quarter. The MSC suite delivered, especially strong performance and the engineering suite generated good growth despite the challenges faced in the engineering and construction industry. The APM suite delivered a record quarter, the largest quarter in its history. We signed some exciting transactions in the quarter that highlight the opportunity for APM to drive new value creation opportunities for customers across all industries. Key transactions were signed with customers in mining, engineering and construction, pulp and paper, refining, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and specialty chemicals. At the same time, we had a number of APM transactions that were delayed as customers adjusted their operations to current conditions. APM is an emerging set of technologies, which makes it easier for some prospective customers to delay purchasing decisions as part of their near-term cost-saving initiatives. We remain very encouraged by the breadth of APM pipeline activity and are confident we will see improved performance as the economy normalizes. Today, the APM suite is being used by 103 customers in 33 different countries and we have the largest pipeline of business in the young history of this suite. Following are highlights of some of the transactions signed in the quarter. First, a European oil and gas company that also produces low-carbon energy and is a long-time customer of AspenTech's MSC suite, signed a global enterprise agreement for AspenTech's multivariable control technology, DMC3. This customer is committed to a net zero greenhouse emissions target by 2050, as part of the Paris Climate Change Agreement, and identified multivariable process control as one of the key enabling technologies that will contribute to meet its objective. Aspen DMC3 was selected to be standardized across all refining operations over competing offerings due to our clear market leadership in process control. Second, a Europe-based global E&C company, focused on the asset life cycle of its end-user customers across many industries, once again, renewed its agreement with AspenTech and increased spend by licensing our APM suite. This customer conducted an evaluation of multiple software technology suppliers and selected AspenTech for its broad-ranging vision and leading market position. This company expects to become a digitalization partner to our joint customers, and plans to promote and implement our APM suite as part of expanding relationships in the operations and maintenance space. Third and final, a leading global chemical company in Japan and long-term customer of AspenTech, selected Aspen Mtell to improve maintenance operations as part of its corporate digitalization transformation initiative. The customer evaluated technology from seven local and foreign companies and selected our product after the result of a proof-of-concept pilot. The initial deployment will be at one site in Japan with the expectation of an enterprise rollout in the future. We also had a solid quarter of profitability and free cash flow. We believe the strength of our balance sheet and financial model, together with our operating discipline is a significant competitive advantage during difficult market cycles. We have the resources and flexibility to continue investing in our core growth initiatives, which further extends our product market leadership. I would now like to provide you with some additional details about our performance for the full year 2020. From a product perspective, the engineering business grew annual spend 5.4% for the year; generating 33.4% of our overall annual spend growth. Our manufacturing and supply chain or MSC business continued to perform at a high level, delivering annual spend growth of 12.7%, representing 49.5% of our total annual spend growth. The combined engineering and MSC businesses came in the middle of the range of the original guidance given for the fiscal year of 7 to 9 points of growth contribution from those two suites. The Asset Performance Management or APM business, generated total annual spend growth of over 64% or 17.1% of our total annual spend growth for annual spend growth for the year, contributing 1.7 points of annual spend growth. We think the positive contribution and strong gross growth of our three suites speaks to the multiple growth levers in our business. At the end of the year, our installed base of business was split 58% engineering and 38% MSC, with APM at 4% on an annual spend basis. Our three core verticals of energy, chemicals and engineering and construction contributed 37.7%, 34.3% and 18% of our growth in annual spend during the year, respectively. One of the trends we're also pleased with is our performance in the global economy industries or GEIs, which contributed 10% of our annual spend growth for the year with the pharmaceuticals industry included in this segment and growing 19.7% in the year. The success of the GEIs is a positive indicator of the opportunity with the APM suite and the potential for further end-market diversification. At the end of fiscal year 2020, the energy vertical represented 41% of our business; chemicals 28%; E&Cs 25%; and GEIs, including pharma, 6%. An important trend to note is that over the last six years, more of our business has shifted away from the E&C industry, now representing 25% of our annual spend from 31% at the end of fiscal year 2014, while we have continued to grow and create significant value for our shareholders. For the full year, our attrition rate was 4.2%. We were pleased with the trends in attrition in both the fourth quarter and for the full year. It is important to recognize that we generated 13.8% gross growth for the year. This is growth prior to attrition. Turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2021. We entered the year still facing uncertainty in our core end-markets. Positively, we continue to have a strong pipeline across all three of our product suites and significant customer interest in newer solutions like APM, GDOT and Aspen Enterprise Insights. This encouraging demand trends reflect in part the strategic importance of digitalization investments in the process and other capital-intensive industries. Based on our fourth quarter results, which we felt could be a good barometer for the rest of the calendar year and current visibility into the business, our expectations of how the macro environment will impact our business in fiscal year 2021 have shifted since early May. We are now projecting gross growth to be double-digit again. Our expectation for attrition is marginally higher than our original expectation in the range of 5% to 6%, though, as I noted, we remain confident it will not reach the peak from the previous cycle. The year-over-year increase in attrition reflects a worsened economic environment, particularly for E&C customers and recognizes that we have a larger than usual amount of business up for renewal this fiscal year. As we discussed at length on our last earnings call, while we expect attrition to increase from fiscal year 2020 levels, there are several factors that gives us confidence that attrition will not reach the highs that we experienced during the last cycle. Please note that we expect attrition to be somewhat evenly distributed across all four quarters of the year and anticipate growth will follow our historical seasonality, with the majority of the sequential growth in our business occurring in the second half of the fiscal year. Taking all this into account, we are targeting annual spend growth of 6% to 9% in fiscal year 2021, underlying this guidance, it's an expectation that our core engineering and MSC suites will grow in the 4% to 7% range, and APM will contribute approximately 2 points of growth. The resiliency demonstrated by our business in fiscal year 2020 gives us confidence to continue investing in our key strategic priorities in fiscal year 2021. We announced one of our top investment priorities today with the introduction of our new AIoT Hub that is a result of the integration of recent investments in Industry 4.0 digital capabilities, including the acquisitions of RtTech, Sabisu and Mnubo. It will also include our process industries leading data historian InfoPlus.21 and related capabilities. This new AIoT Hub will focus on data, connectivity, edge and cloud capabilities, visualization and insights and provide a cloud-ready environment for our next-generation hybrid AI products and solutions. The Hub enables, seamless and flexible data mobility and integration across the enterprise from sensors to the edge and cloud, and accelerate the delivery of business insights for the capital-intensive industries. A key focus for the AIoT solutions organization will be to grow the installed base of our IP.21 historian by expanding access to data at the enterprise level, as our customers increase their use of data to deploy our high-value applications and those of third parties using the Hub cloud-ready capabilities. We are very excited about the opportunity for the AIoT Hub, and believe it will further reposition and strengthen AspenTech in the rapidly-expanding segment of Industry 4.0 digital capabilities. We will also be releasing later this year the newest version of the aspenONE suite, which kicks off the introduction of a new generation of software products with hybrid modeling capabilities that will leverage the AIoT Hub for their delivery. Hybrid modeling will combine AI algorithms and capabilities directly with first principle's domain knowledge and expertise in our current software products to significantly advance accuracy and responsiveness without the need for customers to invest in expensive armies of data scientists. We will also expand our investments in APM to increase market coverage and best position this suite to benefit from the improvement in the macro environment over time. In addition, we will materially increase investments in sales capacity for the GEI markets to capitalize on the opportunity we see in those verticals. We look forward to discussing all these and more during our Annual Investor Day, which will be held in November. As Karl will detail later, we are forecasting another strong year of profitability and free cash flow generation in fiscal year 2021, which is supported by our operating discipline and growth outlook. In addition, we will be resuming our stock repurchase program. Our board of directors recently authorized the repurchase of up to $200 million of stock this fiscal year. We believe our ability to consistently return capital to shareholders throughout the business cycle is evidence of the strength and stability of our business. To conclude, I'm as excited as I've ever been about the outlook for AspenTech. While the current macroeconomic environment is challenging, there are many factors that support long-term growth for the business. The introduction of the AIoT Hub and the innovations that will be delivered in our new software release will further reinforce the value our mission-critical solutions have generated for customers for nearly 40 years and uniquely position AspenTech to again lead the next transformation of the process industries. We believe the recovery from the current economic macro conditions will create the right environment for the company to get back to sustainable double-digit growth in the future. I'm confident in our ability to execute in these challenging times and to generate value for our shareholders over the years to come. Now, let me turn the call over to Karl. Karl? Hi, Matt. Well, I mean, look, again, and this is a little bit back to what we saw in Q4, and that we continue to have good conversations with customers. But at the same time, we recognize the environment that these customers are operating in. The uncertainty around how economic growth is going to develop over the next two, three quarters based on the resolution or not of the pandemic. But what you see in our guidance is, again, a solid performance from our MSC suite. Certainly, an engineering business that will reflect increased attrition. But as you saw, we're guiding that to 5% to 6% from 4.2%, and an APM business that should perform in line or better than it did in fiscal year 2020, from a standpoint of point of growth contribution. The range is just a reflection of, I think, that uncertainty that we see, but also the positive conversations that we're seeing at the high-end of the attrition is associated with the low-end of our growth guidance and vice versa, and perhaps a little bit less gross growth from the engineering business that what we saw in fiscal year 2020. And while we hope the MSC business will perform at the same level, we also would expect perhaps a little bit of a slowdown in gross growth in that business. But overall, 6% to 9% is a range that we're very comfortable with for the fiscal year. Yeah. So yes, we do have, and we've talked about different industries in the past on GEIs. We've sort of pivoted away from a couple of them, power and water, I think water \u2013 forget the name exactly of it. But certainly, mining is core to our activities there. You can expect us to do more in pharmaceuticals. We believe there's also an opportunity in food and beverage. And there's one or two others that we're looking at. We'll give you much more clarity, uncertainty on exactly the industries that we're now going to be focusing on come the November Investor Day. But just know that we believe there's an opportunity there. We see it. And we're going to put more sales resources into these industries going forward. And Matt, the other part of your question direct versus indirect. Certainly, we're seeing good traction from indirect but based on what we're seeing, we also feel that we need to step in with our own direct sales organization into some of these industries, and that's where our investment will go into. Yeah. No problem, Matt. Thank you. Hi, Jack. Look, just \u2013 and we've always said that in a way, as economic \u2013 the macro environment margins get tightened and demand suffers for these customers, they focus more and more on efficiencies, on flexibility, on agility and that's what our products do. I told this story to investors during the sort of the call back that we had with you, all of you in May and June, one of the largest global chemical companies been using our multivariable control technology to drive more throughput through their units, their ethylene crackers and their propylene plants prior to COVID. Of course, with the demand destruction, the objective was no longer increased throughput through those plants. They shifted the objective function for our controllers to drive-in a stability in the plants, operational stability to drive-in better quality in their products. And this Executive Vice President was so excited because they could do this and sort of drive that sort of flexibility, have that sort of flexibility in our technology. So this is what we do. Look, our technology is not only to be used during a steady state and growth environment. As you can adjust the economic function of our products and to whatever objectives you're trying to accomplish. Supply chains get disrupted. Our supply chain solutions can be used to re-plan refineries, to optimize distribution logistics across multiple plants for demand and supply. So, this is what we do. And in a way, the conversations we've had since this all happened are much more real, and we expect they will continue to be. For a couple of years, we've said that digitalization is becoming front-and-center for this industry that we're in the early stages of technology adoption and automation. And we believe those trends will only accelerate going forward. Thank you. Hi, Rob. Okay. Well, I mean, Rob, I think throughout last year, and especially the first half of the year, we maintained that really most of our growth was going to come in in Q3, Q4. We were prepared to deliver in my opinion a fantastic Q3 quarter until basically March 8 hit. And we did what we did in Q3. Our performance in Q4 on APM is just a reflection of what we felt was going to be the second half of fiscal 2020, which were going to prove the breakout capacity of our APM business. It was a record quarter for APM in Q4. The fact is that, it could have been even better, but certainly some customers that were looking at the technology to sign up for it for the first time hesitated. We had some good medium-large deals where customers at the very end decided to delay their decision. So we've explained that in the prepared remarks, it's an emerging set of technologies. And in a way, it's an easy decision to delay investment in something like that. But we're also very confident about the suite and the technologies in the suite is being validated by customers. We did some sizable deals in the quarter. And look, while it's hard to be patient. As the economic environment recovers, we'll see APM come back and give us opportunity to provide its breakout capacity. At the same time, like you said, fiscal year 2020, we're guiding for what I believe and we believe is solid guidance, solid growth in the context of the uncertainty and macro that we're seeing, and we'll go from there. Yeah. No. I mean, look, of course, a lot of it will come out of the engineering suite, the E&C vertical. We'll probably see some attrition as well in the energy vertical. But I think it will follow the historical pattern associated with the downturn that we saw in 2015 and 2016, not to the same level that it did back then, but certainly same pattern, same profile. That's what we expect. Hi, Jason. Yeah. I mean, Jason, that's a good point. I mean, when we started talking about the APM pipeline three years ago, it was all sort of first-time deals in the pipeline. Now the pipeline also has much larger deals, enterprise-type deals based on the fact that we now have some customers that have been using the technology for one or two years, and we've been expanding into more sites, and we're having conversations with some of these customers about doing an enterprise transaction. So we did that with one of our customers in Q4 in one of the GEI industries. And our expectation is that we're going to have an opportunity to do more of those in the future. Yeah. I mean, look, we only worry about the competition when we're competing against them head-to-head. Otherwise, they have to worry about their own business. What we see when in head-to-head competition is that we continue to hold our own. One of the vignettes talked about this Japanese customer evaluating seven technology providers and selecting AspenTech. By the way, we also have some of the global consulting and global implementation companies now. Not only partnering with AspenTech, but actually making APM and the Mtell product exclusive in their go-to-market activities with their own customers through the conviction that they are seeing in the market about the product. So the business continues to build, including the ecosystem around the APM suite and the Mtell product. So, this is all part of the success that I believe we continue to have with APM. Thank you, Jason. Hi, Andrew. Yes. No. I mean, look, some of the deals from Q3 closed in Q4. Some of them, sort of, crossed all of Q4, and they're now in Q1. There were some deals in Q4 that closed in Q4 and some deals in Q4 that moved out of Q4. In a way, what the last three weeks of March did was push the pipeline into the future. But the opportunities haven't disappeared. It's just that they all got pushed into the future. And we closed some of that in Q4, and now it's in fiscal year 2021. But, look, it's \u2013 like, we said in the prepared remarks, it's an emerging technology, there has to be a strong conviction by customers to spend the money. We're asking them to spend in the middle of this uncertainty. And some customers are pulling the trigger and others are deciding to sort of delay. But overall, we are happy. Look, it's a suite; it's a product that grew year-on-year, 64%. Yes, it didn't grow what we had hoped it would grow, but 64%, I still think is pretty decent in the context of everything that was going on in the last four months of our fiscal year. Well, let me look at \u2013 we gave a range of 6% to 9%. And again, we're not oblivious to the challenges in the market. But at the same time, Q4, if you look at the earnings result from our customers after \u2013 in the last few weeks, you could see how it was one of the most challenging quarters they've ever faced financially, and they still \u2013 we still saw the commitment to continue to drive efficiencies in their business. So while we are cognizant of the macro environment that reigns in out there, we also saw good traction with our customers and the implementation of our products. So that's why you have the range that you have. It's a wider range than we've ever given. But we've done a lot of analysis around our business, and well, we gave you the range that we gave you because we believe in it. Yeah. Hi, Mark. Well, no, look, actually, quite a bit. And when you talk about the GEI industries, that's the case, when you talk about mining, when you talk about pulp and paper, even specialty chemicals and other places. Now when we talk about energy and chemicals, incumbency from a standpoint that it's a customer of AspenTech, not incumbency in that, there's already some APM product in there. But certainly, the fact that we have a long time existing relationships gives us a leg up against the competition, but we're proven that we can go into other industries and equally show success with the APM suite. So, this is why we're stepping up our investment in our sales organization for the GEIs, and more to come on that when we do our Investor Day in November. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Look, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. I just want to take a minute to also thank the AspenTech team. Again, I believe they did a tremendous job pivoting in early April to apply the learnings that we gain from the 2015, 2016 downturn and the leadership they demonstrated. I think our Q4 results should be further proof of the financial model and operating resiliency of this business. I know there were a lot of questions from investors during the call backs in May and June about the resiliency of our business in the face of everything that was going on. I hope we've proven that our business has a resiliency to it that is real. And furthermore, that behind the scenes, over the last four, five years, we've worked to transform our organization, the execution, how we lead, and I believe what we achieved in Q4 and fiscal year 2020 is a reflection of that. And well, fiscal year 2021 is ahead of us. So, thank you, everyone."

            "name": "Karl Eric Johnsen - Aspen Technology, Inc.",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter fiscal 2020 results for the period ending June 30, 2020. I'm Karl Johnsen, CFO of AspenTech, and with me on the call is Antonio Pietri, President and CEO. Before we begin, I will make the Safe Harbor statement that during the course of this call, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from such projections or statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's call and contained in our most recently filed Form 10-Q. Also, please note that the following information relates to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, August 12, 2020. Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. The structure of today's call will be as follows: Antonio will discuss business highlights from the fourth quarter; and then I will review our financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal year 2021. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio? Thanks, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the fourth quarter fiscal 2020. As a reminder, these results are being reported under Topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings, and more specifically, renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years and this non-linearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods. In our view, annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business, and annual free cash flow, the most important metric for assessing the overall value our business generates. Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all our current invoices for our term license agreements at the end of each period was approximately $593 million at the end of the fourth quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 9.6% on a year-over-year basis and 3.1%, sequentially. Total Contract Value, or TCV, which we define as the aggregate value of all payments received or to be received under all active term license agreements, including maintenance and escalation. We believe the TCV metric gives insight into the scale of our overall business. As of June 30, 2020, the total contract value was $2.76 billion. This compares to $2.57 billion at June 30, 2019. Total bookings, which we define as the total value of customer term license contracts signed in the current period less the value of term license contracts signed in the current period but where the initial licenses are not yet deemed delivered under Topic 606 plus term license contracts signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period was $236.2 million, a 2% decrease year-over-year. Total bookings in fiscal year 2020 were $610.1 million, a 6% decrease year-over-year. This decrease in the quarter and for the year was the result of a lower amount of renewal bookings for each period, versus the comparable year-ago period. As a reminder, the timing of renewal bookings is not an indicator of our growth or health of our company. Overall, we were pleased with our bookings' performance in the quarter, which reflected solid demand across all three product suites and attrition that was in line with our expectations. Total revenue was $199.3 million for the fourth quarter, a 1.8% increase from the prior-year period. Turning to profitability, beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $70.5 million compared to $69.1 million in the year-ago period. Total expenses, including cost of revenue were $85.6 million, which was up from $84.5 million in the year-ago period, and down from $85.9 million last quarter. Operating income was $113.7 million, and net income for the quarter was $97.6 million, or $1.43 per share. Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition-related fees, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter of $122.9 million, representing a 61.7% non-GAAP operating margin, compared to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $119.9 million and 61.3%, respectively in the year-ago period. As a reminder, operating margin is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings and recognition of license revenue which is typically highest in the fourth quarter. We believe focusing on annual free cash flow as a percentage of annual spend is the most appropriate way to assess the efficiency of our performance in a period. Non-GAAP net income was $104.9 million, or $1.54 per share based on 68.2 million shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $287.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $431.2 million outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility. We did not repurchase any stock in the fourth quarter and completed $150 million of stock buybacks during the fiscal year. In the fourth quarter, we generated $99.7 million of cash from operations and $99.5 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software, and acquisition-related payments. Our cash flow performance was generally in line with our expectations, but did reflect lower-than-usual cash collection, as some customers were more cautious in managing their cash flow given the current macro environment. We had approximately $18 million of receivables due June 30 that were not collected until the first few weeks of July. Overall, we have not seen any material changes in contract or billing terms, or the collectability of our receivables since the pandemic began. For the full year 2020, we generated $243.3 million of cash from operations and $243.1 million of free cash flow. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables within our press release, which is available on our website. I would now like to close with guidance. Consistent with fiscal years 2020 and 2019, we will be providing guidance on an annual basis. This year, we will also be providing renewal bookings on a quarterly basis to provide better insight into the quarterly cadence of our revenue. We expect bookings in the range of $770 million to $850 million, which includes $519 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal year 2021. This includes $81 million of contracts up for renewal in the first quarter. From a linearity perspective, we currently anticipate 40% to 45% of fiscal year 2021 bookings coming in the first-half of the year with the remainder in the second-half. With respect to annual spend growth, as Antonio mentioned, we are now forecasting 6% to 9% annual spend growth. In terms of timing, we would expect the linearity of sequential growth to be similar to recent years. This means the majority of our annual spend growth will occur in the second-half of the fiscal year. We expect revenue in the range of $704 million to $754 million. We expect license revenue in the range of $485 million to $534 million, and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $192 million and $28 million, respectively. From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $372 million to $377 million. Taken together, we expect GAAP operating income in the range of $332 million to $377 million for fiscal 2021, with GAAP net income of approximately $290 million to $327 million. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $4.29 to $4.83. From a non-GAAP perspective, we now expect non-GAAP operating income of $374 million to $420 million and non-GAAP income per share in the range of $4.78 and $5.32. From a free cash flow perspective, we now expect $260 million to $270 million. Our fiscal 2021 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments in the range of $60 million to $70 million. To wrap up, our performance in the fourth quarter and our outlook for fiscal 2021 demonstrates AspenTech's ability to generate solid growth and profitability in trying circumstances. We are focused on continuing to deliver significant value to our customers and investing in the next-generation of products that will provide additional ways to improve the performance of their assets. With that, we would now like to begin the Q&A. Operator? Yes. So there's probably two pieces to it. One is, that $18 million, that's probably about a 3, 4 day increase in our DSO and we're carrying that forward. Just assuming that, that dynamic will hold for the year. So it's a little bit of that playing into it. But then also, you've got cash taxes are up considerably next year. Part of that is there's a little bit of \u2013 about $7.5 million of that is for catch up for Topic 605 adoption that we've been paying, you're allowed to pay over 3 years. So a little bit of that too. So I think if you look at those two pieces, that gives you your answer. And I think the collections are right in line with what we'd expect with that slight bump in the DSO and then the cash taxes. Yeah."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your host, Mr. Karl Johnsen, CFO. Please go ahead.\nKarl Johnsen: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our third quarter fiscal 2020 results for the period ending March 31, 2020. I\u2019m Karl Johnsen, CFO of AspenTech. And with me on the call is Antonio Pietri, President and CEO.

Also, please note that the following information relates to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, May 6, 2020. Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. The structure of today\u2019s call will be as follows.

With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, Karl, and thank you all for joining us today. We hope all of you and your families are staying healthy. The world and macro environment have changed dramatically since our last earnings call, as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption in the oil market. On today\u2019s call, I will primarily focus my remarks on how we have responded to recent events and provide an update on our expectations for demand in our core markets. AspenTec\u2019s number one priority has been and continues to be the safety, health and well-being of our employees and customers. We have all been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and we reacted quickly to protect our employees and customers around the world and have adhered to the various work-from-home and travel restrictions. The digital readiness plan put in place by our IT team over the past few years allowed for a seamless transition to remote working. We also observed that beginning in the second week in March, many of our customers moved aggressively to shift their employees to work-from-home arrangements, while maintaining adequate staffing to operator their complex assets safely and reliably. We\u2019re encouraged by what we have heard from our customers about their safety and health during this time, and our thoughts are with them during this trying period. The COVID-19 pandemic has been exacerbated for our customers in the oil and gas industry by the precipitous drop in the price of oil that began in early March after the breakdown in negotiations between the OPEC+ group members. The combination of these two disruptions has forced customers in our end markets to deal with an extraordinarily rapidly changing macro environment, while working from home. I\u2019m very proud to say that AspenTech organization has stepped up in a big way to support our customers and help them sustain their operations during this difficult time. The AspenTech customer support, customer care and customer success management organizations have increased their digital efforts to continue to deliver world-class services to our customers. Our professional services team has deployed digital processes to implement our mission-critical software remotely, so that customers can begin realizing value on time as expected. We have also made our key learning courses available for free to customers through the end of May. This will enable our customers to continue to learn and develop their skills in the use of AspenTec\u2019s products. We are also waiving the fee for customers to earn their certification in the use of the different products of AspenTech. This has been well received, as seen in social media postings, where customers explain their certificates. We are proud of these actions, and customers are recognizing these efforts through very positive feedback. Before I begin my remarks on the business environment, I want to remind investors that AspenTech has been through multiple business cycles in its 38-year history and demonstrated our resiliency during these times. While this current situation is not that unique, we believe we\u2019re well-positioned to navigate the current market conditions based on the mission-critical nature of our products and solutions, the value they create in our customers\u2019 operations, our durable business model and strong balance sheet. I\u2019m also very proud of how the organization has rallied to people around this new set of economic circumstances and applied what we learned from the 2015/2016 period to quickly adapt our operations. This means, continue to provide a growth environment for our employees, attract best-in-class talent, increased focus on expenses and productivity, continue to drive market growth, maintain a strong cash position and reassess our capital allocation for liquidity reasons and to take advantage of potential opportunities in the market. In summary, we have assumed both a defensive and an offensive stand in the face of this downturn. AspenTech had one of the strongest operational and financial profiles of publicly-traded software companies before the COVID crisis, and I have no doubt that AspenTech will sustain this profile on the other side of this current downturn. Now, let me turn our attention to the recently completed quarter. Looking at our financial results for the quarter, revenue was $132 million, GAAP EPS was $0.64 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.74. Annual spend was $575 million, up 9.3% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $81.2 million, and we returned $50 million to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 452,000 shares. With respect to our growth performance through early March, we were on track to deliver our strongest quarterly growth performance since fiscal year 2014 and to meet our full-year guidance target. We were seeing solid demand across all three product suites and our three core verticals before the precipitous drop in oil prices, the spread of the COVID-19 virus and call for shelter in place orders around the world. The speed of the economic deterioration in the final three weeks of the quarter created so much immediate uncertainty and loss of business visibility that it led customers to postpone signing certain contracts, including some of the largest ones in the quarter. These customers told us that they will reevaluate these contracts once they have better business visibility. Despite these challenges, we had some notable highlights in the quarter, including, one, our field sales team closing a number of significant transactions for all of our product suites and in all of our primary verticals, while the team and our customers work remotely in the midst of so much uncertainty. Our longstanding relationship with customers and their familiarity with our solutions enabled us to complete transactions over the phone or video conference. Two, a strong sales performance above plan in the Asia-Pacific region and solid performances in Europe and the Middle East, with every major sales really delivering growth, including the \u2013 our SMB team. Three, closing multiple transactions in China. In fact, we received a special dispensation from the Chinese government to visit the headquarter offices of a national oil company to conduct face-to-face meetings in mid-March for an important contract renewal. This is a powerful example of how mission-critical AspenTech is for customers\u2019 operations. Fourth, signing the first APM enterprise transaction with a global pharmaceutical company. And Five, our professional services organization progressing and, in a few cases, completing the implementation of our solutions for several customers doing so remotely after transitioning to 100% remote in patients and training. I would now like to reference three transactions that were in the quarter. First, a global pharmaceutical company that is a long-term customer and user of our three product suites signed the first enterprise license for our Aspen Mtell product, as well as enterprise access for our manufacturing execution systems platform. The customer had started evaluation and deployment of Aspen Mtell over 18 months ago and had deployed it to a number of sites. Based on the result and value capture, the customer decided to roll out the technology across all manufacturing sites as one of the key building blocks of its digitalization strategy. Second, a top five global chemical company, headquartered in the Middle East, extended the use of the Aspen Mtell product to one of its mega facilities in the region. This is the same customer we mentioned several quarters ago that initially evaluated technology from 26 companies in the selection phase of the process. After winnowing that field to two, we were chosen following a successful pilot site deployment over the last nine months that demonstrated superior performance compared to a competitor doing a parallel pilot site implementation. And third and final, late in the quarter and despite all the macro uncertainty in its operations, we renewed and increased the contract for our MSC solutions with one of the largest independent refiners in the United States. This customer did so, actually remade one of its key requirements by demonstrating the deployment of our Aspen PIMS-AO refinery planning solution in the cloud to leverage high-performance computing. The contract was signed despite this customer delaying the restart of a refinery after its maintenance turnaround and reducing production rates significantly in other refineries due to deteriorating demand for fuels reproduced as a result of the country-wide lockdowns. Our recent performance demonstrates that we can successfully support and sell to our customers remotely for as long as it is required to do so. We will continue to evaluate our operations and adjust as necessary to meet our customers\u2019 needs. With regards to the current market environment, we view it as a combination of an exogenous shock creating a severe short-term economic impact followed by an uncertain demand recovery similar to the global financial crisis of 2008/2009 and the fiscal year 2015/2016 cycle, which was a supply-driven downturn, with additional complexity of operating assets remotely due to COVID-19 lockdowns. This current environment is resulting in different headwinds with different time lines for each of our core markets. I would like to highlight how we see this impact. One, there have been CapEx reductions announced by a number of oil companies as a result of the collapse in oil prices, resulting from the combined effect of oversupply and COVID-19 demand destruction. This, in turn, is needing oil producers to cut back production by reducing production rates or shortening production as a result of the steep drop in oil demand and field storage capacity. Two, the severity of the downturn has also caused some oil refining and chemical businesses to adjust their OpEx projects. Refiners have also enacted production rate reductions due to lower demand and storage facilities reaching full capacity. Three, chemical customers have also announced CapEx costs, and some are facing declining demand in certain segments, although relatively less to what has been seen in the energy segment. Fourth, CapEx investment for some new LNG facilities is likely to be deferred to account for a short-term decrease in global economic activity. And finally, five, E&C customers will see pressure on their backlog due to the lower CapEx outlook across the different industries. The net result is a challenging near-term business environment for AspenTech. As economies begin to reopen and activity rebounds, we expect that, first, there will be more demand for fuels, gas and petrochemicals, supporting the recovery of owner operators in refining and chemical, followed by E&C and upstream customers as CapEx spend begins to recover. While there\u2019s no doubt that our customers are facing a difficult immediate and short-term outlook, the fundamental business value AspenTech delivers to them has not changed and will likely become even more important. I would like to highlight the following. One, we expect that the long-term secular trend towards digitalization and automation in the process industries will likely become even more pronounced, as customers will need to redouble efforts to improve efficiency and do more with less by digitalizing existing processes and finding new ways to create value. For example, we foresee greater focus on predictive maintenance and process analytics tools to increase safety and reliability with particular focus on AI capabilities, such as those found in Aspen Mtell and Aspen [indiscernible]. And we foresee owner-operator customers, including upstream operators, will continue to focus on improving the profitability of their assets and therefore, will invest in engineering and MSC solutions. For example, our Aspen GDOT dynamic optimization solution that can optimize fuel production envelopes in refineries can potentially create an additional $30 million to $50 million in benefits for a typical 200,000-barrel refinement. Two, we expect E&C customers will continue to reimagine their engineering design processes to improve their workforce productivity and cost definition accuracy to sustain their already challenged operating margins. They will do this by relying on the digital integration found across our engineering product suite and also on the future deliverables from our partnership with Hexagon PPM that will produce fully digital data and workflows across the full design life cycle of these assets. Three, we expect E&C customers to look for new sources of revenue by selling operations and maintenance services to our common end-user customers, in many cases, leveraging AspenTech solutions. And finally, four, we expect growth opportunities in certain global economy industries for GEI markets. For example, we believe the mining industry will provide added growth, as companies in this sector accelerate their digitalization efforts to improve their operations. So what does all this mean for AspenTech? In view of the current highly uncertain environment, we\u2019re adjusting our annual spend growth rate \u2013 our annual spend growth target to 7% to 9% for fiscal 2020, compared to our original expectation of 10% to 12%. We now expect our engineering and MSC suites will contribute 5.5% to 7% of that growth and APM, the remaining 1.5 to 2 points of growth. The impact to growth expectations in our APM business has been proportionately greater since, as we had stated before, we expected the majority of our APM growth to come in the second-half of fiscal year 2020. We expect the attrition rate for the year to still be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. This all means that, again, we\u2019re expecting to deliver solid double-digit gross growth this fiscal year. We\u2019re also adjusting our free cash flow guidance to $230 million to $260 million from $260 million to $270 million, which reflects the impact of lower annual spend growth and conservatism around the timing of collections, as we have a significant portion of our quarterly invoices due on June 30. We will continue to closely evaluate our cost structure as we always have and remain focused on delivering a strong free cash flow margin. We have also taken steps to increase our cash position out of an abundance of caution and due to the high level of uncertainty in the market. This includes drawing down $100 million from our revolving credit facility and posting our share repurchase program at the end of the third quarter. We will continue to evaluate the economic situation. And as conditions normalize, we will evaluate resuming our repurchase program. While it is too early to provide specific insight into our expectations for fiscal 2021, I want to share our current point of view. One, AspenTech has a seasoned management team that successfully navigated the last major oil industry downturn and used the levers in our business to continue to create value for our customers and investors. An important added difference this time around is the creation of our customer success management group two years ago and the material impact that it has had on sustaining usage and value for our customers. This group played a material role in the outcome achieved with a U.S. independent refiner ordered in the customer demands. Two, with respect to gross growth and attrition. First, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic about the demand environment for our products going forward based on our current quarter pipeline of business, which is being validated by ongoing customer engaging. Second, AspenTech is better positioned for this current downturn than in 2015/2016, since we are not coming out of an upstream CapEx investment supercycle, as was the case in calendar 2014, when oil prices started to decline. This means, first, the entitlement in our E&C customer contracts is much more closely in line with the CapEx reality of the last four years, which experienced flat to mid-single-digit growth after a 40% decline from 2014 to 2017, presenting better alignment between usage and entitlement. Second, the Latin American business with national oil companies, which represented nearly 25% of the total increase in attrition between 2016 and 2018 has not recovered and therefore, being reset. As a result, there cannot be a similar negative impact from this customer segment. Third, our business with upstream owner operators was able to reset between 2015 and 2017, and an important aspect of this slow recovery was through growth in our MSC and APM businesses from installation and operating assets as opposed to our engineering products for which an entitlement is mostly headcount-related. Fourth, we have made significant inroads with our MSC innovation delivered over the last five years or more, which is supporting sustained demand by owner operators in refining and chemicals as part of their growing automation and digitalization initiatives. Fifth, the APM business that we launched in 2017 has proven itself as a market leader and is contributing growth even in the most uncertain of environments, such as the one we just saw at the end of March. And sixth and final, we understand how we need to adjust the total market tactics for our engineering business using the learnings from the 2015/2016 downturn. All the factors just mentioned gives us the confidence in predicting that our attrition rate is unlikely to return to the highs we saw during the last cycle, even as we have a larger portion of our contract portfolio up for renewal. Three, we also plan to continue making incremental investments in our product roadmap and artificial intelligence and analytics in new growth areas like ATM and in our long-term strategic vision. We expect our next major product release to include innovation that will create significantly more value and kickoff a second transformation of the process industry is comparable to the late 1970s after the introduction of the first generation of advanced software solutions. The near-term challenges in the economy do not change the exciting long-term opportunities we see in the business. We believe making these investments will further strengthen our market leadership and value proposition as conditions improve over time. We will fund investments in the areas mentioned about by first, reallocating existing spend from areas where the return on that spend is now unattractive. Cost discipline has been a core focus and competency of our management team and we\u2019re confident we will be able to maintain our target margins while making strategic investments in the business. While we expect our growth profile will be lower in the near-term than our most recent growth rate, it is important to take a step back and look at AspenTec\u2019s performance relative to the macro environment. Generating positive growth in the midst of the most challenging economic environment anyone has faced speaks to the strategic importance of our products to improve the efficiency, profitability, safety and reliability of our customer operations, the resiliency of our business model and the strength of our long-term contract strategy. To summarize, AspenTech has faced challenging markets before. We have successfully navigated through each of them and provided a stronger position on the other side. I\u2019m confident we will do so again. We\u2019re quickly adapting to respond to unprecedented changes in the market in recent weeks. We are focused on supporting our customers and ensuring we deliver as much value as we can to that. Now, let me turn the call over to Karl. Karl?\nKarl Johnsen: Thanks, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the third quarter fiscal 2020. As a reminder, these results are being reported under topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings and, more specifically, renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods, resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal, is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years, and this nonlinearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods. In our view, the annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business, the annual free cash flow, the most important metric for assessing the overall value our business generates. Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for our term license agreement at the end of each period, was approximately $575 million at the end of the third quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 9.3% on a year-over-year basis and 1.9% sequentially. As Antonio mentioned, we had a number of transactions that were postponed at the end of the quarter due to customer uncertainty regarding the economy. Total bookings, which we define as the total value of customer term license contracts signed in the current period, less the value of term license contracts signed in the current period, but where the initial licenses are not yet deemed delivered under topic 606, plus term license contracts signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period, was $126.7 million, a 21% decrease year-over-year. The decrease in bookings reflects a combination of less renewal bookings compared to the year ago quarter, as well as the pushing out of transactions described above. The attrition rate was consistent with our guidance range for the year. The lower bookings performance resulted in total revenue of $132 million for the third quarter, an 11% decrease from the prior year period. Turning to profitability, beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $70.1 million, compared to $62.8 million in the year ago period. Total expenses, including cost of revenue, were $85.9 million, which was up from $77.2 million in the year ago period and $83.1 million last quarter. The year-over-year expense increase reflects the impact of the organic investments we have been making in the business and the impact of the Nuvo and Sabisu acquisitions. Operating income was $46.2 million, and net income for the quarter was $43.5 million, or $0.64 per share. Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition-related fees, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter of $55.3 million, representing a 41.9% non-GAAP operating margin, compared to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $78.3 million and 52.9%, respectively, in the year ago period. Non-GAAP net income was $50.8 million, or $0.74 per share based on 68.5 million shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $192.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. We ended the quarter with $435.2 million outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility, which reflects the $100 million that we drew down in March. As Antonio mentioned, we repurchased $50 million of stock during the third quarter and have decided to pause our buyback program for the time being. We have more than $270 million of liquidity, which we believe provides us with ample financial flexibility. We generated $81.4 million of cash from operations and $81.2 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and acquisition-related payments. We experienced some delays in collections as certain customers were more closely managing \u2013 managed their cash flow at the end of the quarter. We collected the majority of these receivables in April. A collection \u2013 a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables within our press release, which is also available on our website. I would now like to close with guidance. We are updating the guidance we provided on our fiscal second quarter earnings call. We now expect bookings in the range of $540 million to $590 million, which includes the $317 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2020. This is a decrease from our original guidance of $600 million to $650 million. With respect to annual spend growth, as Antonio mentioned, we\u2019re now forecasting 7% to 9% annual spend growth. We now expect revenue in the range of $550 million to $582 million. We expect license revenue in the range of $335 million to $367 million, and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $180 million and $35 million, respectively. From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $338 million to $343 million. The decrease in GAAP expenses largely reflects lower stock-based compensation expense, as well as savings from lower T&E. Taken together, we expect GAAP operating income in a range of $211 million to $239 million for fiscal 2020, with GAAP net income of approximately $187 million to $209 million. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $2.72 to $3.05. From a non-GAAP perspective, we now expect non-GAAP operating income of $249 million to $277 million and non-GAAP income per share in the range of $3.16 to $3.48. From a free cash flow perspective, we now expect $230 million to $260 million. This compares to $260 million to $270 million previously. Our fiscal 2020 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments in the range of $40 million to $45 million. To wrap up, our business continues to generate solid growth and profitability in an unprecedented situation. Our strong financial profile and the substantial value our mission-critical software provides to customers gives us confidence we are well-positioned for the long term. With that, we would now like to begin the Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Rob Oliver from Baird.\nRobert Oliver: Hi, Antonio. Hi, Karl, nice to hear you guys sounding healthy, and thanks so much for taking my question. Antonio, one for you, and then I had a follow-up for you, Karl. So I know you mentioned you\u2019ve had some initial conversations with customers that sounded a bit optimistic as you look out of this quarter. As you think about this next kind of 12 months for you guys, the renewal profile for you is pretty sizable. And I was just curious for any color you could provide, obviously, in light of all that you said to caution us about that optimism and maybe any pockets of strength or relative weakness within those areas? And then I had a quick follow-up.\nAntonio Pietri: Okay. Well, I mean, look, certainly, the commentary on the cautious as it relates to our current quarter and engagement that we have going on with customers, their intent to do business in the context of an overall pipeline that we brought into the quarter. With regards to FY 2021, I tried to highlight in script and my commentary, why we believe that while we have large renewals coming up in fiscal year 2021, we also believe that we\u2019re better positioned this time around with regards to attrition for the different reasons that I enumerated in my comments and you can go back and read them in the transcript. But look, overall, I think, we are better prepared for this downturn, in general. We feel confident. The fact is that our planning process for FY 2021 was pretty much completed as the downturn hit us, and we\u2019ve now gone back and relooked at the assumptions that we had, that\u2019s almost completed now as well. And I would say that we have a lot of visibility to the extent that we can have in this uncertain environment, what\u2019s coming to us in FY 2021. I think our E&Cs were reset in the last four years and there isn\u2019t as much overhang or a misalignment between usage and entitlement as there was in 2015/2016. I believe our owner operators are driving much greater value from our solutions. The upstream sector is being reset as 2015/2016, and it\u2019s only recovered slightly and a lot of that to our MSC and APM suite. So overall, look, I mean, I think it will still be a difficult environment going forward, uncertain in a matter of really what\u2019s been eight weeks, oil prices have gone from $50 to minus $37, and they\u2019re trading somewhere around $25, I think. But the conversations we\u2019re having with customers are positive. And I also believe that digitalization automation will continue to be top of mind for these customers, especially now with this very challenging environment.\nRobert Oliver: That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Antonio. And then, Karl, just quickly for you. You mentioned towards the end of your prepared remarks some collections delays among some customers. And just was curious, if customers are asking for payment terms, extensions. What you\u2019re seeing there early on? And how you guys are accommodating them and how it might compare to previous cycles? Thanks, gentlemen.\nKarl Johnsen: Yes. No, that\u2019s the \u2013 kind of like the delay at the end of Q3, I think, was two things. One was a little bit of people being nervous about what was going on in the macro environment. But then we got paid the majority of that in the next couple of weeks, over the next three weeks or so. The other part was them doing business [Technical Difficulty] There\u2019s a few that \u2013 more in the SMB organization that you would hear from. But these are the smaller customers, and it\u2019s only been maybe a handful that we\u2019ve heard from.\nRobert Oliver: Thanks, guys.\nKarl Johnsen: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from Blair.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Matt.\nMatthew Pfau: Hey, guys, thank for taking my questions. First, I wanted to talk about the difference in the reductions between APM and then the manufacturing and engineering contribution. So obviously, APM came down much more on a percentage basis. Is that just because those were more weighted towards the back-half of the year? Or is there something with the products reason why those are \u2013 APM seeing a greater impact in MSC and engineering?\nAntonio Pietri: No. I mean, look, the timing of the negotiations breaking down between the OPEC+ group and then the spread of COVID-19, I mean, was \u2013 couldn\u2019t have been worse than it was. It was three, four weeks before the end of the quarter as business was lining up very nicely for a very strong quarter. Some of those end in deals, as we have communicated to investors, were going to be large deals. And of course, some of them with upstream operators and some in [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this is the operator. We are experiencing technical difficulties with Mr. Pietri\u2019s line. Please continue to hold. The call will resume momentarily.\nKarl Johnsen: Hi, Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes.\nKarl Johnsen: I think, we\u2019re still live, but we\u2019re waiting for the operator, again.\nAntonio Pietri: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Antonio, your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Okay. Thank you. Sorry, something went wrong. Is there a question that I should be answering, or\u2026?\nOperator: Yes. We do have a question from the line of Steven Koenig.\nAntonio Pietri: Okay. Hi, Steve.\nSteven Koenig: Hi there. Hi, Antonio. Hi, Karl. Yes. So I\u2019m interested in maybe getting some color on attrition. And, Antonio, you had made some helpful remarks about how you\u2019re better aligned in terms of your usage, not as much overhang as, say, in 2015 time period in those years. Can you tell me \u2013 maybe a little bit more color on it\u2019s curious and encouraging that attrition \u2013 that you\u2019re not expecting it to increase. And I\u2019m just \u2013 I\u2019m curious as customers renew and particularly in oil and gas and upstream oil and gas, what is it that keeps you from having them reduce their token value? And is this kind of because that\u2019s more of a longer-term impact that might happen in subsequent years, like it happened in the 2015 to 2018 period? Or is there just a different dynamic that they\u2019re already going into this without a lot of spare token? So just any help you can give me on that would be appreciated?\nAntonio Pietri: Okay. Yes. So specifically to upstream operators. So one, we have long-term contracts in place with them and that\u2019s always protected us from sort of a rapid decline in annual spend. But having said that, the upstream market was also reset for us in 2015/2016. And that market also recovered with the CapEx spend recovery, which was sort of flat to mid single-digit over four years. And what we saw during that period of recovery was greater focus by upstream operators on our manufacturing and supply chain solutions and the APM solutions. As a culture of optimization has started to sort of grow inside upstream operators, a lot of refining people, a lot of refining best practices were started to migrate into upstream and, therefore, the use of MSC and eventually APM. We saw some growth in engineering \u2013 in our engineering business, which is related to headcount, because engineers use our engineering solutions to do modeling and other work. So we believe that in this downturn, our upstream business is less exposed to the significant drop in CapEx spend, because, one, it was reset four, five years ago and \u2013 in gross margin. And the growth that we experienced was coming from \u2013 lot of it from the MSC and APM side of the business, which are technologies that are put online to \u2013 when these assets are operating and they tend not to sort of shut it off. So we think we\u2019re better protected in that regard, like with \u2013 similar dynamic with our E&C customers. Look, we\u2019re not saying, we\u2019re not going to experience some attrition, but I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t believe it would be of the magnitude that we saw in the 2015/2016 period.\nSteven Koenig: Great. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. If I can ask one follow-up, that would be great. It\u2019s somewhat related. So attrition didn\u2019t increase in the quarter, but annual spend obviously got impacted somewhat, as Karl talked about. And so that was kind of predominantly in new business, and you said that was a little bit more weighted to APM just because of the seasonality you were expecting in APM. Can you maybe tell us \u2013 give us some color or some help on \u2013 in terms of those numbers that we\u2019re seeing in the print. They\u2019re well below analyst expectations. But how much of that was simply kind of seasonality of the renewals that maybe analysts hadn\u2019t really embedded in our estimates correctly versus a shortfall against your expectations on annual spend and maybe revenue \u2013 and/or revenue, whatever is most informative to talk about?\nAntonio Pietri: I mean, look, I think, first of all, we lowered our guidance for the year, but attrition is staying at the same level. So in a way, I\u2019ll lead you to an obvious completion, which is attrition may be more or less at the same level that we\u2019ve seen, but it\u2019s less about new growth, sort of gross growth, which delivers then a lower growth rate outcome, but sort of in a different way. It isn\u2019t that attrition is jumping in that because of the environment, customers are going to be spending less, which is exactly what we saw at the end of March. Everything was lined up for a great quarter. Customers \u2013 I mean, look, there was no visibility at the end of March and everyone pulled back. We took our own actions\u2026\nSteven Koenig: Yes.\nAntonio Pietri: \u2026with respect to liquidity and other things. So that\u2019s the outcome that you see. It was just the contracts didn\u2019t get signed. Attrition was in line with what we expected. We believe attrition will be in line in Q4 with what we\u2019ve always expected, which \u2013 and therefore, be in line with our \u2013 with the guidance we gave at the end of \u2013 at the beginning of the year. It\u2019s really about new gross \u2013 new growth or gross growth as we refer to.\nSteven Koenig: Got it.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes.\nSteven Koenig: Very helpful. Thanks, Antonio.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Yes, no problem.\nOperator: Your our next question comes from Andrew DeGasperi from Berenberg.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew DeGasperi: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess, just one quick one. On the \u2013 last quarter, you mentioned that several of those APM customers had delayed their decisions, but you were very confident they were going to sign in Q3. I know, obviously, the obvious happened in March. But I wasn\u2019t sure if you mentioned this already. But did any of those customers \u2013 you don\u2019t have to be specific, actually signed the APM product in, call it, January/February timeframe?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I mean, look, I\u2019ll be specific, because I was specific with all of you that these customers were in the upstream sector, and the fact is that those two deals were in the works to get signed. And unfortunately, one of those operators is in the oil sands in Canada, some of the most expensive oil you can find that from a cost of production. And that customer took very immediate action, not only to pull back on signing the deal, but also they implemented. It was just incredible how quickly they took action on shutting down operations and laying people off. So that deal didn\u2019t get signed nor the other one that I talked about. Those were two important deals that were impacted. But we signed other deals. And the guidance that we\u2019re providing for APM is also in the context of a highly uncertain environment, but we\u2019re working some important deals for APM and we\u2019ll see how Q4 comes out. But no, they didn\u2019t get signed.\nAndrew DeGasperi: All right. And then I guess, maybe on the end markets you currently serve, do you expect the chemical side to recover first? I mean, how should we sort of think about the global recovery from your perspective?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, I mean, look, I think it\u2019s in a way, the first thing people will do is getting their cars and drive out, take it out of their garages. I think I\u2019ve driven my car once or twice in the last five weeks. So okay, what happened there, you start consuming fuel and eventually, there\u2019s gas, and eventually, you start buying stuff and that hits petrochemicals. So I think refiners will start benefiting the earliest. You\u2019re already hearing from refiners that they see the demand stabilizing and starting to pick up in some of the states that are opening up. And that\u2019s great. I think, eventually, that sort of flows down into chemical manufacturers. And then over time, it will be a matter of supply/demand balance for oil, and then as oil companies feel more comfortable with the macro and their profitability or cash generation, then the CapEx should start to recover. So we see CapEx sort of at the back-end of the recovery, refiners benefiting the soonest and then chemical producers.\nAndrew DeGasperi: Great. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Jackson Ader from JPMorgan.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Jackson.\nJackson Ader: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes.\nJackson Ader: Could we just \u2013 maybe without giving specific numbers, but could we maybe just talk about what you can see in token usage today versus maybe six months ago or a year ago? And how that relates to the core annual spend growth?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, look, we get usage data from customers that\u2019s part of our \u2013 as part of our agreement. Now that data shows a lag. Normally, most customers are on a quarterly basis, where they have to send the data. There\u2019s a few that, because of their stature, it\u2019s only once a year, they do it. But \u2013 so there\u2019s always a lag to the data. But look, we were seeing some growth in users, but a lot more \u2013 but better growth in usage. So difference between users and usage, usage is about intensity of use, users is number of people using the products. So users were growing sort of in low single-digit fashion. Usage was supporting the double-digit growth trajectory that we were having. And so we were very pleased. And that\u2019s the \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ve been tracking this data, I mean, since 2005, 2006. So we have very good visibility into these dimensions.\nJackson Ader: Okay.\nAntonio Pietri: But there is a lag to it.\nJackson Ader: Sure. Yes, that makes sense. I don\u2019t think that we would have expected it to be real-time.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes.\nJackson Ader: Then just a quick follow-up. Antonio, in your prepared remarks, you talked about shifting some investments into more attractive areas away from some areas that maybe are now not as attractive or less attractive. Can you just give us a couple of examples of maybe areas that aren\u2019t as attractive today as they were before? And what areas are more attractive today than they were before all this happened?\nAntonio Pietri: No, that means \u2013 look, I mean, certainly, short-term attractiveness marketing, for example, I mean, you can \u2013 in my opinion, at this moment, you can do some \u2013 there\u2019s a type of marketing that as you can do and no one will listen, because people are very busy with other issues. So certainly, areas such as that. Look, I mean, there were ongoing investments with regards to staffing up in certain regions, where maybe as a result of the downturn, that does \u2013 it doesn\u2019t make sense to follow through with that and sort of pull back and wait a little bit until we see how this plays out. Also, it\u2019s a combination of headcount growth in some regions, some marketing spend maybe some systems that \u2013 or things and \u2013 maybe can wait a little longer. So it\u2019s just a multitude of things. And it\u2019s amazing that once you start looking for stock, how much you can find in the context of this environment.\nJackson Ader: Okay. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. No problem.\nOperator: And I show no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Pietri for any closing remarks.\nAntonio Pietri: Okay. Well, look, thank you, everyone, for joining, and apologies for the issues that we had. And nonetheless, we certainly have a busy schedule participating in Investor conferences and some callbacks with some of you. So look forward to that. And I hope everyone is healthy and keep maintaining a good well-being. Okay. Thank you, everyone. Bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. We ask that you disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Antonio Pietri",
            "content": "Thank you, Karl, and thank you all for joining us today. We hope all of you and your families are staying healthy. The world and macro environment have changed dramatically since our last earnings call, as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption in the oil market. On today's call, I will primarily focus my remarks on how we have responded to recent events and provide an update on our expectations for demand in our core markets. AspenTec's number one priority has been and continues to be the safety, health and well-being of our employees and customers. We have all been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and we reacted quickly to protect our employees and customers around the world and have adhered to the various work-from-home and travel restrictions. The digital readiness plan put in place by our IT team over the past few years allowed for a seamless transition to remote working. We also observed that beginning in the second week in March, many of our customers moved aggressively to shift their employees to work-from-home arrangements, while maintaining adequate staffing to operator their complex assets safely and reliably. We're encouraged by what we have heard from our customers about their safety and health during this time, and our thoughts are with them during this trying period. The COVID-19 pandemic has been exacerbated for our customers in the oil and gas industry by the precipitous drop in the price of oil that began in early March after the breakdown in negotiations between the OPEC+ group members. The combination of these two disruptions has forced customers in our end markets to deal with an extraordinarily rapidly changing macro environment, while working from home. I'm very proud to say that AspenTech organization has stepped up in a big way to support our customers and help them sustain their operations during this difficult time. The AspenTech customer support, customer care and customer success management organizations have increased their digital efforts to continue to deliver world-class services to our customers. Our professional services team has deployed digital processes to implement our mission-critical software remotely, so that customers can begin realizing value on time as expected. We have also made our key learning courses available for free to customers through the end of May. This will enable our customers to continue to learn and develop their skills in the use of AspenTec's products. We are also waiving the fee for customers to earn their certification in the use of the different products of AspenTech. This has been well received, as seen in social media postings, where customers explain their certificates. We are proud of these actions, and customers are recognizing these efforts through very positive feedback. Before I begin my remarks on the business environment, I want to remind investors that AspenTech has been through multiple business cycles in its 38-year history and demonstrated our resiliency during these times. While this current situation is not that unique, we believe we're well-positioned to navigate the current market conditions based on the mission-critical nature of our products and solutions, the value they create in our customers' operations, our durable business model and strong balance sheet. I'm also very proud of how the organization has rallied to people around this new set of economic circumstances and applied what we learned from the 2015/2016 period to quickly adapt our operations. This means, continue to provide a growth environment for our employees, attract best-in-class talent, increased focus on expenses and productivity, continue to drive market growth, maintain a strong cash position and reassess our capital allocation for liquidity reasons and to take advantage of potential opportunities in the market. In summary, we have assumed both a defensive and an offensive stand in the face of this downturn. AspenTech had one of the strongest operational and financial profiles of publicly-traded software companies before the COVID crisis, and I have no doubt that AspenTech will sustain this profile on the other side of this current downturn. Now, let me turn our attention to the recently completed quarter. Looking at our financial results for the quarter, revenue was $132 million, GAAP EPS was $0.64 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.74. Annual spend was $575 million, up 9.3% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $81.2 million, and we returned $50 million to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 452,000 shares. With respect to our growth performance through early March, we were on track to deliver our strongest quarterly growth performance since fiscal year 2014 and to meet our full-year guidance target. We were seeing solid demand across all three product suites and our three core verticals before the precipitous drop in oil prices, the spread of the COVID-19 virus and call for shelter in place orders around the world. The speed of the economic deterioration in the final three weeks of the quarter created so much immediate uncertainty and loss of business visibility that it led customers to postpone signing certain contracts, including some of the largest ones in the quarter. These customers told us that they will reevaluate these contracts once they have better business visibility. Despite these challenges, we had some notable highlights in the quarter, including, one, our field sales team closing a number of significant transactions for all of our product suites and in all of our primary verticals, while the team and our customers work remotely in the midst of so much uncertainty. Our longstanding relationship with customers and their familiarity with our solutions enabled us to complete transactions over the phone or video conference. Two, a strong sales performance above plan in the Asia-Pacific region and solid performances in Europe and the Middle East, with every major sales really delivering growth, including the \u2013 our SMB team. Three, closing multiple transactions in China. In fact, we received a special dispensation from the Chinese government to visit the headquarter offices of a national oil company to conduct face-to-face meetings in mid-March for an important contract renewal. This is a powerful example of how mission-critical AspenTech is for customers' operations. Fourth, signing the first APM enterprise transaction with a global pharmaceutical company. And Five, our professional services organization progressing and, in a few cases, completing the implementation of our solutions for several customers doing so remotely after transitioning to 100% remote in patients and training. I would now like to reference three transactions that were in the quarter. First, a global pharmaceutical company that is a long-term customer and user of our three product suites signed the first enterprise license for our Aspen Mtell product, as well as enterprise access for our manufacturing execution systems platform. The customer had started evaluation and deployment of Aspen Mtell over 18 months ago and had deployed it to a number of sites. Based on the result and value capture, the customer decided to roll out the technology across all manufacturing sites as one of the key building blocks of its digitalization strategy. Second, a top five global chemical company, headquartered in the Middle East, extended the use of the Aspen Mtell product to one of its mega facilities in the region. This is the same customer we mentioned several quarters ago that initially evaluated technology from 26 companies in the selection phase of the process. After winnowing that field to two, we were chosen following a successful pilot site deployment over the last nine months that demonstrated superior performance compared to a competitor doing a parallel pilot site implementation. And third and final, late in the quarter and despite all the macro uncertainty in its operations, we renewed and increased the contract for our MSC solutions with one of the largest independent refiners in the United States. This customer did so, actually remade one of its key requirements by demonstrating the deployment of our Aspen PIMS-AO refinery planning solution in the cloud to leverage high-performance computing. The contract was signed despite this customer delaying the restart of a refinery after its maintenance turnaround and reducing production rates significantly in other refineries due to deteriorating demand for fuels reproduced as a result of the country-wide lockdowns. Our recent performance demonstrates that we can successfully support and sell to our customers remotely for as long as it is required to do so. We will continue to evaluate our operations and adjust as necessary to meet our customers' needs. With regards to the current market environment, we view it as a combination of an exogenous shock creating a severe short-term economic impact followed by an uncertain demand recovery similar to the global financial crisis of 2008/2009 and the fiscal year 2015/2016 cycle, which was a supply-driven downturn, with additional complexity of operating assets remotely due to COVID-19 lockdowns. This current environment is resulting in different headwinds with different time lines for each of our core markets. I would like to highlight how we see this impact. One, there have been CapEx reductions announced by a number of oil companies as a result of the collapse in oil prices, resulting from the combined effect of oversupply and COVID-19 demand destruction. This, in turn, is needing oil producers to cut back production by reducing production rates or shortening production as a result of the steep drop in oil demand and field storage capacity. Two, the severity of the downturn has also caused some oil refining and chemical businesses to adjust their OpEx projects. Refiners have also enacted production rate reductions due to lower demand and storage facilities reaching full capacity. Three, chemical customers have also announced CapEx costs, and some are facing declining demand in certain segments, although relatively less to what has been seen in the energy segment. Fourth, CapEx investment for some new LNG facilities is likely to be deferred to account for a short-term decrease in global economic activity. And finally, five, E&C customers will see pressure on their backlog due to the lower CapEx outlook across the different industries. The net result is a challenging near-term business environment for AspenTech. As economies begin to reopen and activity rebounds, we expect that, first, there will be more demand for fuels, gas and petrochemicals, supporting the recovery of owner operators in refining and chemical, followed by E&C and upstream customers as CapEx spend begins to recover. While there's no doubt that our customers are facing a difficult immediate and short-term outlook, the fundamental business value AspenTech delivers to them has not changed and will likely become even more important. I would like to highlight the following. One, we expect that the long-term secular trend towards digitalization and automation in the process industries will likely become even more pronounced, as customers will need to redouble efforts to improve efficiency and do more with less by digitalizing existing processes and finding new ways to create value. For example, we foresee greater focus on predictive maintenance and process analytics tools to increase safety and reliability with particular focus on AI capabilities, such as those found in Aspen Mtell and Aspen [indiscernible]. And we foresee owner-operator customers, including upstream operators, will continue to focus on improving the profitability of their assets and therefore, will invest in engineering and MSC solutions. For example, our Aspen GDOT dynamic optimization solution that can optimize fuel production envelopes in refineries can potentially create an additional $30 million to $50 million in benefits for a typical 200,000-barrel refinement. Two, we expect E&C customers will continue to reimagine their engineering design processes to improve their workforce productivity and cost definition accuracy to sustain their already challenged operating margins. They will do this by relying on the digital integration found across our engineering product suite and also on the future deliverables from our partnership with Hexagon PPM that will produce fully digital data and workflows across the full design life cycle of these assets. Three, we expect E&C customers to look for new sources of revenue by selling operations and maintenance services to our common end-user customers, in many cases, leveraging AspenTech solutions. And finally, four, we expect growth opportunities in certain global economy industries for GEI markets. For example, we believe the mining industry will provide added growth, as companies in this sector accelerate their digitalization efforts to improve their operations. So what does all this mean for AspenTech? In view of the current highly uncertain environment, we're adjusting our annual spend growth rate \u2013 our annual spend growth target to 7% to 9% for fiscal 2020, compared to our original expectation of 10% to 12%. We now expect our engineering and MSC suites will contribute 5.5% to 7% of that growth and APM, the remaining 1.5 to 2 points of growth. The impact to growth expectations in our APM business has been proportionately greater since, as we had stated before, we expected the majority of our APM growth to come in the second-half of fiscal year 2020. We expect the attrition rate for the year to still be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. This all means that, again, we're expecting to deliver solid double-digit gross growth this fiscal year. We're also adjusting our free cash flow guidance to $230 million to $260 million from $260 million to $270 million, which reflects the impact of lower annual spend growth and conservatism around the timing of collections, as we have a significant portion of our quarterly invoices due on June 30. We will continue to closely evaluate our cost structure as we always have and remain focused on delivering a strong free cash flow margin. We have also taken steps to increase our cash position out of an abundance of caution and due to the high level of uncertainty in the market. This includes drawing down $100 million from our revolving credit facility and posting our share repurchase program at the end of the third quarter. We will continue to evaluate the economic situation. And as conditions normalize, we will evaluate resuming our repurchase program. While it is too early to provide specific insight into our expectations for fiscal 2021, I want to share our current point of view. One, AspenTech has a seasoned management team that successfully navigated the last major oil industry downturn and used the levers in our business to continue to create value for our customers and investors. An important added difference this time around is the creation of our customer success management group two years ago and the material impact that it has had on sustaining usage and value for our customers. This group played a material role in the outcome achieved with a U.S. independent refiner ordered in the customer demands. Two, with respect to gross growth and attrition. First, we're cautiously optimistic about the demand environment for our products going forward based on our current quarter pipeline of business, which is being validated by ongoing customer engaging. Second, AspenTech is better positioned for this current downturn than in 2015/2016, since we are not coming out of an upstream CapEx investment supercycle, as was the case in calendar 2014, when oil prices started to decline. This means, first, the entitlement in our E&C customer contracts is much more closely in line with the CapEx reality of the last four years, which experienced flat to mid-single-digit growth after a 40% decline from 2014 to 2017, presenting better alignment between usage and entitlement. Second, the Latin American business with national oil companies, which represented nearly 25% of the total increase in attrition between 2016 and 2018 has not recovered and therefore, being reset. As a result, there cannot be a similar negative impact from this customer segment. Third, our business with upstream owner operators was able to reset between 2015 and 2017, and an important aspect of this slow recovery was through growth in our MSC and APM businesses from installation and operating assets as opposed to our engineering products for which an entitlement is mostly headcount-related. Fourth, we have made significant inroads with our MSC innovation delivered over the last five years or more, which is supporting sustained demand by owner operators in refining and chemicals as part of their growing automation and digitalization initiatives. Fifth, the APM business that we launched in 2017 has proven itself as a market leader and is contributing growth even in the most uncertain of environments, such as the one we just saw at the end of March. And sixth and final, we understand how we need to adjust the total market tactics for our engineering business using the learnings from the 2015/2016 downturn. All the factors just mentioned gives us the confidence in predicting that our attrition rate is unlikely to return to the highs we saw during the last cycle, even as we have a larger portion of our contract portfolio up for renewal. Three, we also plan to continue making incremental investments in our product roadmap and artificial intelligence and analytics in new growth areas like ATM and in our long-term strategic vision. We expect our next major product release to include innovation that will create significantly more value and kickoff a second transformation of the process industry is comparable to the late 1970s after the introduction of the first generation of advanced software solutions. The near-term challenges in the economy do not change the exciting long-term opportunities we see in the business. We believe making these investments will further strengthen our market leadership and value proposition as conditions improve over time. We will fund investments in the areas mentioned about by first, reallocating existing spend from areas where the return on that spend is now unattractive. Cost discipline has been a core focus and competency of our management team and we're confident we will be able to maintain our target margins while making strategic investments in the business. While we expect our growth profile will be lower in the near-term than our most recent growth rate, it is important to take a step back and look at AspenTec's performance relative to the macro environment. Generating positive growth in the midst of the most challenging economic environment anyone has faced speaks to the strategic importance of our products to improve the efficiency, profitability, safety and reliability of our customer operations, the resiliency of our business model and the strength of our long-term contract strategy. To summarize, AspenTech has faced challenging markets before. We have successfully navigated through each of them and provided a stronger position on the other side. I'm confident we will do so again. We're quickly adapting to respond to unprecedented changes in the market in recent weeks. We are focused on supporting our customers and ensuring we deliver as much value as we can to that. Now, let me turn the call over to Karl. Karl? Okay. Well, I mean, look, certainly, the commentary on the cautious as it relates to our current quarter and engagement that we have going on with customers, their intent to do business in the context of an overall pipeline that we brought into the quarter. With regards to FY 2021, I tried to highlight in script and my commentary, why we believe that while we have large renewals coming up in fiscal year 2021, we also believe that we're better positioned this time around with regards to attrition for the different reasons that I enumerated in my comments and you can go back and read them in the transcript. But look, overall, I think, we are better prepared for this downturn, in general. We feel confident. The fact is that our planning process for FY 2021 was pretty much completed as the downturn hit us, and we've now gone back and relooked at the assumptions that we had, that's almost completed now as well. And I would say that we have a lot of visibility to the extent that we can have in this uncertain environment, what's coming to us in FY 2021. I think our E&Cs were reset in the last four years and there isn't as much overhang or a misalignment between usage and entitlement as there was in 2015/2016. I believe our owner operators are driving much greater value from our solutions. The upstream sector is being reset as 2015/2016, and it's only recovered slightly and a lot of that to our MSC and APM suite. So overall, look, I mean, I think it will still be a difficult environment going forward, uncertain in a matter of really what's been eight weeks, oil prices have gone from $50 to minus $37, and they're trading somewhere around $25, I think. But the conversations we're having with customers are positive. And I also believe that digitalization automation will continue to be top of mind for these customers, especially now with this very challenging environment. Hi, Matt. No. I mean, look, the timing of the negotiations breaking down between the OPEC+ group and then the spread of COVID-19, I mean, was \u2013 couldn't have been worse than it was. It was three, four weeks before the end of the quarter as business was lining up very nicely for a very strong quarter. Some of those end in deals, as we have communicated to investors, were going to be large deals. And of course, some of them with upstream operators and some in [Technical Difficulty] Yes. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. Sorry, something went wrong. Is there a question that I should be answering, or...? Okay. Hi, Steve. Okay. Yes. So specifically to upstream operators. So one, we have long-term contracts in place with them and that's always protected us from sort of a rapid decline in annual spend. But having said that, the upstream market was also reset for us in 2015/2016. And that market also recovered with the CapEx spend recovery, which was sort of flat to mid single-digit over four years. And what we saw during that period of recovery was greater focus by upstream operators on our manufacturing and supply chain solutions and the APM solutions. As a culture of optimization has started to sort of grow inside upstream operators, a lot of refining people, a lot of refining best practices were started to migrate into upstream and, therefore, the use of MSC and eventually APM. We saw some growth in engineering \u2013 in our engineering business, which is related to headcount, because engineers use our engineering solutions to do modeling and other work. So we believe that in this downturn, our upstream business is less exposed to the significant drop in CapEx spend, because, one, it was reset four, five years ago and \u2013 in gross margin. And the growth that we experienced was coming from \u2013 lot of it from the MSC and APM side of the business, which are technologies that are put online to \u2013 when these assets are operating and they tend not to sort of shut it off. So we think we're better protected in that regard, like with \u2013 similar dynamic with our E&C customers. Look, we're not saying, we're not going to experience some attrition, but I don't \u2013 we don't believe it would be of the magnitude that we saw in the 2015/2016 period. I mean, look, I think, first of all, we lowered our guidance for the year, but attrition is staying at the same level. So in a way, I'll lead you to an obvious completion, which is attrition may be more or less at the same level that we've seen, but it's less about new growth, sort of gross growth, which delivers then a lower growth rate outcome, but sort of in a different way. It isn't that attrition is jumping in that because of the environment, customers are going to be spending less, which is exactly what we saw at the end of March. Everything was lined up for a great quarter. Customers \u2013 I mean, look, there was no visibility at the end of March and everyone pulled back. We took our own actions... ...with respect to liquidity and other things. So that's the outcome that you see. It was just the contracts didn't get signed. Attrition was in line with what we expected. We believe attrition will be in line in Q4 with what we've always expected, which \u2013 and therefore, be in line with our \u2013 with the guidance we gave at the end of \u2013 at the beginning of the year. It's really about new gross \u2013 new growth or gross growth as we refer to. Yes. Yes. Yes, no problem. Yes. Hi, Andrew. Well, I mean, look, I'll be specific, because I was specific with all of you that these customers were in the upstream sector, and the fact is that those two deals were in the works to get signed. And unfortunately, one of those operators is in the oil sands in Canada, some of the most expensive oil you can find that from a cost of production. And that customer took very immediate action, not only to pull back on signing the deal, but also they implemented. It was just incredible how quickly they took action on shutting down operations and laying people off. So that deal didn't get signed nor the other one that I talked about. Those were two important deals that were impacted. But we signed other deals. And the guidance that we're providing for APM is also in the context of a highly uncertain environment, but we're working some important deals for APM and we'll see how Q4 comes out. But no, they didn't get signed. Yes. Well, I mean, look, I think it's in a way, the first thing people will do is getting their cars and drive out, take it out of their garages. I think I've driven my car once or twice in the last five weeks. So okay, what happened there, you start consuming fuel and eventually, there's gas, and eventually, you start buying stuff and that hits petrochemicals. So I think refiners will start benefiting the earliest. You're already hearing from refiners that they see the demand stabilizing and starting to pick up in some of the states that are opening up. And that's great. I think, eventually, that sort of flows down into chemical manufacturers. And then over time, it will be a matter of supply/demand balance for oil, and then as oil companies feel more comfortable with the macro and their profitability or cash generation, then the CapEx should start to recover. So we see CapEx sort of at the back-end of the recovery, refiners benefiting the soonest and then chemical producers. Yes. Hi, Jackson. Yes. Well, look, we get usage data from customers that's part of our \u2013 as part of our agreement. Now that data shows a lag. Normally, most customers are on a quarterly basis, where they have to send the data. There's a few that, because of their stature, it's only once a year, they do it. But \u2013 so there's always a lag to the data. But look, we were seeing some growth in users, but a lot more \u2013 but better growth in usage. So difference between users and usage, usage is about intensity of use, users is number of people using the products. So users were growing sort of in low single-digit fashion. Usage was supporting the double-digit growth trajectory that we were having. And so we were very pleased. And that's the \u2013 I mean, we've been tracking this data, I mean, since 2005, 2006. So we have very good visibility into these dimensions. But there is a lag to it. Yes. No, that means \u2013 look, I mean, certainly, short-term attractiveness marketing, for example, I mean, you can \u2013 in my opinion, at this moment, you can do some \u2013 there's a type of marketing that as you can do and no one will listen, because people are very busy with other issues. So certainly, areas such as that. Look, I mean, there were ongoing investments with regards to staffing up in certain regions, where maybe as a result of the downturn, that does \u2013 it doesn't make sense to follow through with that and sort of pull back and wait a little bit until we see how this plays out. Also, it's a combination of headcount growth in some regions, some marketing spend maybe some systems that \u2013 or things and \u2013 maybe can wait a little longer. So it's just a multitude of things. And it's amazing that once you start looking for stock, how much you can find in the context of this environment. Yes. No problem. Okay. Well, look, thank you, everyone, for joining, and apologies for the issues that we had. And nonetheless, we certainly have a busy schedule participating in Investor conferences and some callbacks with some of you. So look forward to that. And I hope everyone is healthy and keep maintaining a good well-being. Okay. Thank you, everyone. Bye."

            "name": "Karl Johnsen",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our third quarter fiscal 2020 results for the period ending March 31, 2020. I'm Karl Johnsen, CFO of AspenTech. And with me on the call is Antonio Pietri, President and CEO. Before we begin, I will make the Safe Harbor statement that during the course of this call, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from such projections or statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's call and in our Form 10-Q for the third quarter of fiscal 2020, which is now on file with the SEC. Also, please note that the following information relates to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, May 6, 2020. Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. The structure of today's call will be as follows. Antonio will discuss business highlights from the third quarter, and then I'll review our financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal year 2020. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio? Thanks, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the third quarter fiscal 2020. As a reminder, these results are being reported under topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings and, more specifically, renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods, resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal, is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years, and this nonlinearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods. In our view, the annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business, the annual free cash flow, the most important metric for assessing the overall value our business generates. Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for our term license agreement at the end of each period, was approximately $575 million at the end of the third quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 9.3% on a year-over-year basis and 1.9% sequentially. As Antonio mentioned, we had a number of transactions that were postponed at the end of the quarter due to customer uncertainty regarding the economy. Total bookings, which we define as the total value of customer term license contracts signed in the current period, less the value of term license contracts signed in the current period, but where the initial licenses are not yet deemed delivered under topic 606, plus term license contracts signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period, was $126.7 million, a 21% decrease year-over-year. The decrease in bookings reflects a combination of less renewal bookings compared to the year ago quarter, as well as the pushing out of transactions described above. The attrition rate was consistent with our guidance range for the year. The lower bookings performance resulted in total revenue of $132 million for the third quarter, an 11% decrease from the prior year period. Turning to profitability, beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $70.1 million, compared to $62.8 million in the year ago period. Total expenses, including cost of revenue, were $85.9 million, which was up from $77.2 million in the year ago period and $83.1 million last quarter. The year-over-year expense increase reflects the impact of the organic investments we have been making in the business and the impact of the Nuvo and Sabisu acquisitions. Operating income was $46.2 million, and net income for the quarter was $43.5 million, or $0.64 per share. Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition-related fees, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter of $55.3 million, representing a 41.9% non-GAAP operating margin, compared to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $78.3 million and 52.9%, respectively, in the year ago period. Non-GAAP net income was $50.8 million, or $0.74 per share based on 68.5 million shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $192.2 million of cash and cash equivalents. We ended the quarter with $435.2 million outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility, which reflects the $100 million that we drew down in March. As Antonio mentioned, we repurchased $50 million of stock during the third quarter and have decided to pause our buyback program for the time being. We have more than $270 million of liquidity, which we believe provides us with ample financial flexibility. We generated $81.4 million of cash from operations and $81.2 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and acquisition-related payments. We experienced some delays in collections as certain customers were more closely managing \u2013 managed their cash flow at the end of the quarter. We collected the majority of these receivables in April. A collection \u2013 a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables within our press release, which is also available on our website. I would now like to close with guidance. We are updating the guidance we provided on our fiscal second quarter earnings call. We now expect bookings in the range of $540 million to $590 million, which includes the $317 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2020. This is a decrease from our original guidance of $600 million to $650 million. With respect to annual spend growth, as Antonio mentioned, we're now forecasting 7% to 9% annual spend growth. We now expect revenue in the range of $550 million to $582 million. We expect license revenue in the range of $335 million to $367 million, and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $180 million and $35 million, respectively. From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $338 million to $343 million. The decrease in GAAP expenses largely reflects lower stock-based compensation expense, as well as savings from lower T&E. Taken together, we expect GAAP operating income in a range of $211 million to $239 million for fiscal 2020, with GAAP net income of approximately $187 million to $209 million. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $2.72 to $3.05. From a non-GAAP perspective, we now expect non-GAAP operating income of $249 million to $277 million and non-GAAP income per share in the range of $3.16 to $3.48. From a free cash flow perspective, we now expect $230 million to $260 million. This compares to $260 million to $270 million previously. Our fiscal 2020 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments in the range of $40 million to $45 million. To wrap up, our business continues to generate solid growth and profitability in an unprecedented situation. Our strong financial profile and the substantial value our mission-critical software provides to customers gives us confidence we are well-positioned for the long term. With that, we would now like to begin the Q&A. Operator? Yes. No, that's the \u2013 kind of like the delay at the end of Q3, I think, was two things. One was a little bit of people being nervous about what was going on in the macro environment. But then we got paid the majority of that in the next couple of weeks, over the next three weeks or so. The other part was them doing business [Technical Difficulty] There's a few that \u2013 more in the SMB organization that you would hear from. But these are the smaller customers, and it's only been maybe a handful that we've heard from. Yes. Hi, Antonio? I think, we're still live, but we're waiting for the operator, again."

With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks, Karl, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. AspenTech delivered solid second quarter results, highlighted by double-digit annual spend growth. We believe, our performance is further indication that customers recognize a significant value, AspenTech Solutions provide as a core part of their digitalization investments to achieve their long-term operational and financial objectives. We remain confident that we\u2019re on track to achieve our full-year growth and profitability objectives. I would like to begin my remarks by looking at our financial highlights for the quarter. For the second quarter, revenue was $124.7 million, GAAP EPS was $0.56 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.66. Annual spend was $564 million, up 3% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $48.1 million and we\u2019ve returned $50 million to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 418,000 shares. I would like to spend a few moments providing some context on the trend we are seeing in our core end markets. Refiners remained a source of strength in the quarter for AspenTech as they continue to expand adoption of our asset optimization solutions as part of their digitalization investments. Operational excellence remained an imperative for refiners, particularly as they\u2019ve experienced some margin compression in recent quarters. AspenTech has a demonstrated track record of delivering value across all aspects of their operations, enabling refiners to run their assets safer, greener, longer and faster. As mentioned in last quarter, the introduction of the new IMO 2020 requirements to reduce sulphur dioxide levels in bunker fuel for transportation ships, which became effective January 1, is a positive demand catalyst for certain refiners. The need to meet increasingly stringent environmental regulations is a key priority for customers in an area, which AspenTech can generate significant value. We believe refiners are still relatively early in their digitalization initiatives and will remain an important growth driver for AspenTech for the foreseeable future. We have the strongest growth quarter with E&C customers in over four years, driven by the improvements in CapEx spending seen over the past couple of years and a continued reduction in attrition from this vertical. We have seen preliminary evidence that the level of CapEx spend in the upstream sector in calendar 2020 will be flat or in the low single-digits. However, we\u2019ve remained confident that we will have a stronger growth year with E&C's than in fiscal year 2019 supported by the nearing of the end of their renewal cycle of our contracts and the continued strength from incremental CapEx spend on LNG projects. As discussed on recent earnings calls, the uncertainty caused by the global trade conflict and deceleration of global growth in calendar 2019 has increasingly affected business conditions for mainly of our chemical customers. Despite these factors, we're encouraged by the solid growth in annual spend achieved in this vertical. We expect announcement of the Phase 1 trade agreement between the U.S and China and a better economic outlook in calendar 2020 will improve the macro environment for these customers. Throughout the quarter, I spoke with a number of chemical executives and they continue to view investments in the digitalization as one of their most important long-term priorities. Turning to APM. At the midpoint of the year, it has contributed 0.64 point to our year-to-date annual spend growth. While APM growth has always been expected to be back end loaded in fiscal year '20, we're somewhat behind where we expected to be at the midpoint of the year. During the second quarter, we had several transactions we expected to close in the quarter that pushed out to the second half of the fiscal year. We remain confident in our ability to deliver approximately 3 points of annual spend growth from our APM business in fiscal 2020. Our confidence is driven by the following factors we expect to happen in the second half of the fiscal year. First, transaction that is slipped from the second quarter will close; second, the increasing maturation of our APM pipeline as more proof-of-concepts are concluded, resulting in customers coming to buying decisions: third, enterprise or multi-sized transactions that are larger than our average transaction are targeted for closure; and fourth, a growing GI business for APM with a number of transactions targeted to close. Of these factors, signing enterprise or multi-site opportunities will be the biggest driver of our second half performance and our ability to achieve our full-year APM growth target. We have a number of this opportunities in our pipeline and our forecast for fiscal 2020, as always anticipated, closing some of this transactions throughout the year. Overall, we are pleased with our business performance in the first half of the year. Our ability to deliver double-digit growth in the quarter with heightened uncertainty in one of our core verticals is an important valuation of the value AspenTech delivers for customers and the mission-critical nature of our solution. I would now like to share a few examples of contracts we closed in the quarter. First, a European Oil & Chemicals company and long-term user of our engineering and MSC Suites, selected AspenTech's supply chain management solution to be deployed across its chemical assets, and integrated with our existing planning solution in its refining business. As part of its digital program, these customers chemical business was looking for a global solution to maximize its business margin, while providing high customer service levels. AspenTech Solution was selected over that of three other established supply chain management software providers in the market. Second, one of our largest E&C customers headquartered in Europe has committed to take our Aspen Mtell product to market with the objective of building a high-margin revenue stream, and its operation and maintenance crew targeting the brownfield assets of its customers. This commitment to Aspen Mtell expensive relationship with this customer into a partnership, where the customer will promote the use of the Mtell capabilities to our common customers and others, and will take on the implementation and support of the product once installed. Third, a North America based chemical customer selected are soon to be released latest generation, planning and scheduling solution after a detailed evaluation of the capabilities of these new product and one of our competitive. This customer plans to replace an in-house developed excel-based planning solution. The AspenTech sales team identified projected benefits in excess of $70 million at the customers three U.S sites when the technology is fully rolled out. Fourth, U.S based oil and gas upstream company selected Aspen Mtell after a detailed sole source evaluation of the product for the selected Aspen Mtell after a detailed sole source evaluation of the product for deployment at two offshore oil production platforms in the U.S and Southeast Asia as part of an initial Phase 1 deployment. The customer is focused on increasing the productivity of their existing assets by generating more volume from existing data. This is one of four digital initiatives in place by the customer. And fifth and final, a North American based chemical producer formed a digital group in 2019 to evaluate the use of in-house and new technologies throughout the business to increase value creation. The digital group identified in excess of $100 million in value creation opportunities in the operations space. After a careful evaluation of internal capabilities and the Aspen ProMV product, the customer decided to select Aspen ProMV for rollout across multiple sites due to superior analytical capabilities and its ease of use, especially for online applications. Value capture from other AspenTech product has already been identified and will become part of the digital group initiatives. As we look to the second half of the year, we're confident about a stronger growth performance and continue to maintain our full-year annual spend guidance. Our confidence is driven by the volume and quality of the pipeline of business in the Q3 and Q4 quarters. The expectation of a more favorable environment for chemical customers, a continued improvement in the growth of the E&C business as we get closer to the end of the contracts renewal cycle, a continuation of the strength of our refining business and increasing contribution to growth by the GI verticals because of the applicability of the APM suite in that space. We also expect attrition to track within the 3.5% to 4.5% range, we guided to at the beginning of the fiscal year. From a product perspective, we continue to make good progress on our investments, in artificial intelligence and data driven applications. Specifically, we are making good progress integrating the new technology stack into the architecture of our future solutions to leverage cloud and edge computing capabilities to support enterprise deployments. We believe there is a significant opportunity to bring to market a new generation of solutions that can substantially increase the value creation across customers assets, representing new value creation opportunities for AspenTech. We continue to make progress in the partners area with meaningful new and existing relationships coming together. This includes the integration of work happening between Hexagon's PPM solutions and AspenTech solutions with significant customer interest and involvement in the process. We are also engaged in formal joint go-to-market activities with a global consulting firm actively promoting our Aspen Mtell and Aspen GDOT products to the sea level suites of our customers. More recently we signed a relationship agreement with one of the global implementation services firms to access its vast network of implementation resources for our products and solutions. We continue to successfully balance investing in our product portfolio as well as our sales capacity, while maintaining our strong levels of profitability. The rigor with which we evaluate investment opportunities and our willingness to reallocate existing investment dollars before commit an incremental capital to new projects; allows us to effectively deliver both a strong growth and margins. Karl will provide more detail in a few minutes, but we are increasing our free cash flow guidance for fiscal 2020, to reflect lower-than-expected tax payments. Before I wrap up, I want to provide an update on our senior management team and Board of Directors. I\u2019m excited to announce that John Hague who has been leading our APM business unit as we promoted to Executive Vice President of Operations. In this role, John is responsible for the global sales, customer success, product marketing and partners organizations as well as continuing to lead our APM business unit. John has been a valued member of the AspenTech team for more than 25 years in a variety of leadership positions, including Head of North America, and Latin-American sales and head of our operations in the Middle East and North Africa based in Bahrain for five years. We also recently added exciting edge computing on IoT domain expertise with the appointment of Dr. Tom Bradicich to AspenTech's Board of Directors. Currently he is the Vice President, Hewlett-Packard fellow and Global Head of Edge and IoT Labs and center of excellence for Hewlett-Packard enterprise and was instrumental in establishing HPE's IoT capabilities. I\u2019m happy to welcome Tom to AspenTech and believe he will complement and enhance the strategic value of our Board of Directors. Finally, earlier today we published our 2020 environmental, social and governance report, a look at AspenTech's continued commitment to delivering exceptional value to all our stakeholders. You can download the report from our website at www.aspentech.com. To wrap up, AspenTech delivered solid second quarter result and we believe we're well positioned to achieve our full-year annual spend growth and profitability outlook. We are successfully executing against an evolving macro environment and have continued to generate double-digit annual spend growth. We believe, we are in the early stages of a significant investment cycle around digitalization technologies in our core markets and GEIs. We are confident that AspenTech is well positioned to benefit from this strength and our focus on executing on the growth opportunities ahead of us. With that, let me turn the call over to Karl. Karl?\nKarl Johnsen: Thanks, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the second quarter fiscal 2020. As a reminder, these results are being reported under topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings, and more specifically, renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods, resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years. And this nonlinearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods. In our view, annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business and annual free cash flow, the most important metric for assessing the overall value our business generates. Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for our term license agreement at the end of each period was approximately $564 million at the end of the second quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis and 3% sequentially. Total bookings, which we define as the total value of customer term license contracts signed in the current period less the value of term license contracts signed in the current period, but where the initial licenses are not yet deemed delivered under topic 606, plus term license contracts signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period was $112.3 million, a 27% decrease year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in bookings reflect a decrease in the amount of term license contracts, up for renewal as compared to the year-ago period. Total revenue was $124.7 million for the second quarter, an 11% decline from the prior year period. The year-over-year decrease in revenue was a result of the decrease in total bookings discussed previously. Turning to profitability, beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $67.5 million, which was up from $61.9 million in the year-ago period. Total expenses, including cost of revenue were $83.1 million, which was up from $76.7 million in the year-ago period and down from $86.8 million last quarter. The year-over-year expense increase reflect the impact of the organic investments we\u2019ve been making in the business as well as the impact of the Nuvo and Sabisu acquisitions. Operating income was $41.7 million and net income for the quarter was $38.3 million or $0.56 per share. Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition related fees, we report -- we reported non-GAAP operating income of $50.9 million, representing a 40.8% non-GAAP operating margin compared to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $71.2 million and 50.7%, respectively in the year-ago period. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period-to-period due to the timing of customer renewals, and therefore license revenue recognized during the quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $45.5 million or $0.66 per share based on 68.8 million shares outstanding. Turning to cash flow. We generated $46.9 million of cash from operations and $48.1 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and acquisition related payments. The reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables within our press release, which is also available on our website. I would now like to close with guidance. Please note that we are reiterating our guidance for all metrics, except for net income, free cash flow, GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS. Recall that we only provide guidance on an annual basis to provide directional commentary on the timing of annual spend and bookings during the year. Full guidance for our income statement metrics can be found in our earnings press release. With respect to annual spend, as s Antonio mentioned, we continue to forecast 10% to 12% annual spend growth in fiscal 2020. Of that, 7% to 9% is expected to come from our engineering and MSC suite and approximately 3% from APM. We continue to expect bookings to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million, which includes $317 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2020. As a reminder, under topic 606, our license revenue recognition is tied to when we recognize bookings. As such, our license revenue linearity will generally track to the bookings linearity. From an expense perspective, we continue to expect total GAAP expenses of $369 million to $374 million and non-GAAP expenses of $303 million to $308 million. From a free cash flow perspective, we are updating our free cash flow guidance to $260 million to $270 million compared to our prior outlook of $250 million to $260 million. Our updated free cash flow guidance reflects lower anticipated cash tax payments of $45 million to $50 million as compared to our prior view of $55 million to $60 million. The lower cash tax payments are a function of a change in when we are required to make cash tax payments related to the implementation of topic 606. Originally, we are required to pay the cash taxes associated with the adoption of topic 606 in fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020. New guidance was issued by the IRS in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, it allows for cash tax payments associated with our adoption of topic 606 to be paid equally in fiscal years 2019 through 2022. From a timing perspective, we anticipate free cash flow in fiscal year 2020 to follow a season -- seasonal pattern similar to fiscal year 2019. We're updating our GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the impact of an increase to our estimated full-year tax rate, which we now expect to be approximately 19% as well as the impact of the shares repurchased in the second quarter. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $2.68 to $3.09, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.43 to $3.84. In summary, we delivered solid second quarter results. We believe, we're on track to achieve our full-year financial target and we're well positioned to continue delivering an attractive combination of growth and profitability that can generate sustained value for shareholders over time. With that, we would now like to begin the Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rob Oliver with Baird. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Rob.\nRobert Oliver: Great. Hey, good evening, gentlemen. Thank you very much for taking my question. So I had one and one follow-up. Antonio, I will start with you. So just on the commentary around the transactions in APM that were pushed out into the second half, I know you stated that you guys remain confident that they can add that 3 points of annual spend. You mentioned the confidence around large enterprises. And I just wanted to kind of double down on that point a little bit. It's been over a year since you guys have made that shift from one-off equipment licenses to site licenses. And I\u2019m just wondering what gives you the confidence that would start to kick in, in the second half when it hasn\u2019t kicked in really to date? And then I just had a follow-up. Thanks.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, I mean, Rob, just as a reminder, in Q3 of FY '19 we closed a large enterprise deal with APM. That customer -- the proof-of-concept, an extended proof-of-concept and went straight into a full enterprise deal, so in a way it has not follow the pattern that we\u2019re seeing with all of our customers which is they buy the licenses for one or two sites, and eventually, after a year or two, they start thinking about increasing to more sites or an enterprise deal. If you look at the trajectory of the APM business, its 2.5 years old now since we formally launched it in July of 2018. And the fact is that now these customers that are ready to expand the scope of the deployment of Aspen Mtell are now looking at multi-site or enterprise style type deal. So the expectation is that we would see -- we have them in the pipeline. We\u2019ve been working then and we know they\u2019re in Q3, Q4. One of the deals that pushed out from Q2 was a customer that was expanding to more sites from originally two sites. So I think as time has passed now the opportunity exists to start closing some of these deals.\nRobert Oliver: Great. Thanks, Antonio. Then, Karl, just a quick one for you. Just on the annual spend guide I know you guys have said -- you mentioned last quarter as well that it would be more backend loaded. So you guys have been clear on that. That having been said, you look at the last couple of years and you guys do see some sequential improvement in Q2. So just wondering if you look at in the context of refineries being strong, E&C strongest quarter four years, chem is solid, is that fair to say that APM is the delta there on why annual spend is kind of flat sequentially? Thank you guys very much.\nKarl Johnsen: Yes. I think, Rob, that\u2019s a big piece of it. But again, the year is playing out very much like we thought it would, where it's going to be a little bit heavy -- heavily weighted toward the back half. APM, as Antonio mentioned, a little bit behind where we wanted it to be at this point of the year. So that\u2019s a piece of it, but I would say the engineering and the MSC businesses were strong and came in generally in line with what we thought they would.\nRobert Oliver: Thanks, guys.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig with Wedbush. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Steve.\nSteven Koenig: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe one start with and one follow-up. On the slips deals, those were primarily or all pretty much APM. And what -- any color on what verticals they were in? Any commonality to why they were slipping and any cancellations?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I mean, look, from a standpoint of the slipping pattern, I think it's consistent with what we've seen in the past and we\u2019ve talked about it. These were larger deals as they were coming through final approvals, more questions came up from the executive suites, Chief Digital Officers and for greater inspection of those deals. Verticals, primarily upstream, where we\u2019re getting traction now with APM and some of it in chemicals as well.\nSteven Koenig: Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks, Karl. And then, Antonio, just -- Antonio, I\u2019m sorry. Thank you for that. Karl, and then just for you, when I parsed out the results and when you're looking at the results in the quarter, where were you -- where did bookings come in with your expectations? And what drove any variation in bookings relative to what you expected? Was that mostly APM as well?\nKarl Johnsen: So I think bookings we said about 40% to 45% would come in the first half of the year, and we are right around 40% if you were to take the kind of the midpoint of our guidance for bookings. So we\u2019re right about where we thought. But with the kind of annual spending a little bit behind where we thought it would be, it's really the growth bookings, the renewals came in pretty much like we thought they were would come in. So that came in pretty much in line. It was more along the lines of some of the growth that Antonio mentioned slipping into the second half of the year.\nSteven Koenig: Got it. Okay. I will stop there. Thanks for your answers, guys.\nKarl Johnsen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Matt.\nMatthew Pfau: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to ask on the chemicals business. And have you already started to see some improvement there, or is this something you are expecting to see over the coming months?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I mean look, the fact is that despite our concerns with sort of the deteriorating macro environment for chemical customers in the second half of last year, especially in the Q4 quarter, we had a solid quarter for our chemicals business. Our expectation and expectation of our customers as we talk to them is, especially with the uncertainty around trade diminution and an improving sort of global economic growth outlook that they will start seeing better demand. And the fact is that if you look at the announcement, the earnings announcement from Dow, chemicals they\u2019ve talked in that announcement already about seeing better demand in the January month. As you listen to the earnings results, certainly for the last quarter and the full-year that they're reporting, they had very poor results, but they\u2019re now starting to see improvement in the demand for their product. So I think this will happen over time here as the year progresses, but within expectation.\nMatthew Pfau: Okay, got it. And then I wanted to ask for an update on the partnership. So over the past year, you've announced quite a few new partnerships, Hexagon, Aon, you announced this E&C customer and sort of global side this quarter, what percentage of your business now is driven by partners and where do you think that could go over time?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I mean, look at the partnerships that we announced around of E&C's they get reflected on the business relationship that we\u2019ve with that customer as they buy APM entitlement to access the products to deploy them as some of this products are getting sold, and then they have to be deployed. The aspect of those relationships with the E&C is that roll-in -- just promoting the technology, but more importantly the implementation because they want to be able to rollout these technologies. With Hexagon is work in progress because we\u2019ve been working on the integration of our products and there's a lot of customer excitement that work has to be done and completed. And then once we release that integration is when we will start seeing the benefit from it. And then some of these new relationships that are more recent with a global consulting firm and the global implementation services firm, its only the last 6 months with the former that we would be going to market and with the implementation firm, really, in the last couple of months only. So hopefully, we will start seeing the impact of those over the next 6 to 12 months.\nMatthew Pfau: Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks, guys.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Jack.\nJackson Ader: Great. Thanks. Hi, good evening. First question is on the larger APM deals. Do they actually attract more competition since they're higher dollar value, or is it the fact that there are larger deals, more products, maybe multi-site, does that already winnow down the number of competitors that can even show up to bid?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, look, the fact is that those multi-site or enterprise deals are the outcome of a selection of technology that has already happened 6ix months, 12 months, 18 months ago. We have been working with the customer to provide the technology and then the customer is working with us and then it's sort of sole-source negotiation. We normally don't see competition in those type of deals, but again because it's new technology, it's new capabilities, is getting deployed into areas where these customers will have to change their business processes, their practices and so on. It requires greater preparation by these customers to absorb the technology. But the type of deals themselves attract more attention as a result of being new spend in new technology. And we\u2019ve discussed these over the last 12 months. It is a phenomena that we continue to see.\nJackson Ader: Okay. That makes sense. And then my follow-up really is, was there any impact at all from kind of the, call it, disruption or unrest that we saw at the very beginning of the year in the Middle East, did you see any impact there?\nAntonio Pietri: No, I don't think so. Our business in the Middle East performed well in the last quarter and we\u2019ve a solid outlook for it this quarter as well.\nJackson Ader: All right. Understood. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Jason.\nJason Celino: Hey, guys. Thanks. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. As we kind of think about global CapEx growth, you mentioned again flat to up low single digits. That\u2019s pretty consistent with what we've been hearing over the last year. But you also, again, saw another strong E&C quarter. Can you just kind of reconciliation the strength you're seeing?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Yes. Well, I mean, look, I think certainly I think the last couple of years CapEx spend in upstream has been sort mid single-digits. This year it looks like it might be flat to low single-digit. So there is a benefit from that. Certainly the attrition rate with our E&C's is coming down as we are completing the renewal of all those contracts and we are nearing the end of the renewal cycle. And then I believe E&C's are benefiting from an increasing CapEx spend to build LNG facilities, not only in the United States but around the world. And it's expected between 2019 and 2025, there will be another $200 billion in CapEx spend in LNG. And I think that\u2019s flowing through the E&C companies at the moment.\nJason Celino: Okay, great. And then one kind of clarifying question for Karl. 2Q OpEx was a little bit lighter than I think what I had expected, specifically in the sales and marketing side. Is it just a matter of specific timing of investments or hiring?\nKarl Johnsen: It was -- it's a little bit of seasonality in sales and marketing, because in Q1 we have our sales kickoff meeting. You typically see that drop off a little bit and then a little bit of timing of our marketing events.\nJason Celino: Okay, great. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew DeGasperi with Berenberg. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew DeGasperi: Thanks. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe first, can you maybe talk about your pricing model on APM or generally in your products. I mean, given that you're saving the customers so much money, I was just wondering do you see any potential price elasticity in your products going forward?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, look, I do think there's elasticity in our pricing. We certainly create a lot of value for our customers and you figure that for that value, there will be greater upside. Well the fact is that there is competition in the market and sort of tends to create sort of a optimum pricing for our products. As we have stated in the past, we do see ourselves as sort of the premium priced software supplier in this market, and it's something that we continuously monitor to make sure that we are aligned with our customers and the market. Look, APM -- the pricing for APM, we have learned a lot over 2 years now, 2.5 years. We believe we\u2019ve the right pricing for our products, especially vis-\u00e0-vis value they create, but we are also monitoring some of those competitors that we see in this space because in a way, there's learning that is happening. There is a new competitors that show up other that were incumbents and so we were very much aware of the pricing that its happening in the market and we are satisfied with where we are with our pricing.\nAndrew DeGasperi: Got it. And just one last question. And it's a follow-up to the previous one. I'm just curious in terms of that Q2 push out on the APM and I apologize if you already answered this, but did you say this was -- there was some kind of inspection being done by the C-suite and that's why the timing was pushed out?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Andrew, in the past what we have said is that because if deals -- generally, this is new technology into new areas of this customer's organization sort of the maintenance area where they are buying technology of this type for the first time. So its new technology, it is new spend and the size of these deals tends to be such that they get visibility of the C-suite and what we found in the past and we saw in Q2 as well, there is more questions that come about out of the C-suite. We try to address that in the past by certainly moving our engagement and making sure we have a sponsorship at the C-suite, not always possible. So we ended up again in a situation where there were a few more questions being asked as these deals get to the final approval stages. And we are working to -- with the customer to provide the information that they need.\nAndrew DeGasperi: Great. Thank you Antonio.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel with Benchmark. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Mark.\nMark Schappel: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Antonio, just building on an earlier question on APM, in the past you have talked about a fair amount of noise in the APM space, especially around questionable competitors. And I was wondering if any of this competitive noise contributed to the elongated sales cycles?\nAntonio Pietri: No, not really. Like I said already, these where transactions that we were in discussions with the customer on a sole source basis. We\u2019ve been -- these customers have already been -- I mean, one of them has already been using our technology for over a year. The other one is certainly a new customer, but we have already been passed the process with the competition and we are in the middle of negotiating and finalizing those deals forward.\nMark Schappel: Great. Thank you. And then on GDOT, the noise around the APM has kind of crowded out GDOT this quarter. And GDOT is supposed to be important growth driver for the business. I was wondering if you could just give a little bit of an update on whether you are still seeing -- well, how that's performing for you?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, there is high aspirations for GDOT. We signed our first GDOT license agreement with a chemical customer in North America. We do not have chemical references for the technology really anywhere and in North America we signed a first license. We expect Q3 and Q4 to have a larger sample of GDOT transactions getting signed.\nMark Schappel: Great. Thank you. That\u2019s all from me.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We do have a follow-up question from the line of Jackson Ader with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Jackson, again.\nJackson Ader: Thanks. Yes, just a quick one to jump back in. The customer turned partner on Mtell, is this -- do you plan on doing more of this? I mean is this a one-off? It's just -- I don't know, it sounds like a completely different type of channel for you guys. So I was just curious, how you looked at it?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. No, as a matter of fact that this is the second type of these customers that have turned partners, if you will. The first one was an North America based E&C company, also one of the largest ones in the world. This is the second one, European-based and one of the largest E&C company. Our expectation is we will be signing a few more of those in the future, yes.\nJackson Ader: Okay. Interesting. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Thank you, Jackson.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Antony -- Antonio Pietri, for closing remarks.\nAntonio Pietri: Okay. Well, thank everyone for joining the call today and as always Karl and I look forward to meeting you when we go visit the different cities. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Karl, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. AspenTech delivered solid second quarter results, highlighted by double-digit annual spend growth. We believe, our performance is further indication that customers recognize a significant value, AspenTech Solutions provide as a core part of their digitalization investments to achieve their long-term operational and financial objectives. We remain confident that we're on track to achieve our full-year growth and profitability objectives. I would like to begin my remarks by looking at our financial highlights for the quarter. For the second quarter, revenue was $124.7 million, GAAP EPS was $0.56 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.66. Annual spend was $564 million, up 3% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $48.1 million and we've returned $50 million to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 418,000 shares. I would like to spend a few moments providing some context on the trend we are seeing in our core end markets. Refiners remained a source of strength in the quarter for AspenTech as they continue to expand adoption of our asset optimization solutions as part of their digitalization investments. Operational excellence remained an imperative for refiners, particularly as they've experienced some margin compression in recent quarters. AspenTech has a demonstrated track record of delivering value across all aspects of their operations, enabling refiners to run their assets safer, greener, longer and faster. As mentioned in last quarter, the introduction of the new IMO 2020 requirements to reduce sulphur dioxide levels in bunker fuel for transportation ships, which became effective January 1, is a positive demand catalyst for certain refiners. The need to meet increasingly stringent environmental regulations is a key priority for customers in an area, which AspenTech can generate significant value. We believe refiners are still relatively early in their digitalization initiatives and will remain an important growth driver for AspenTech for the foreseeable future. We have the strongest growth quarter with E&C customers in over four years, driven by the improvements in CapEx spending seen over the past couple of years and a continued reduction in attrition from this vertical. We have seen preliminary evidence that the level of CapEx spend in the upstream sector in calendar 2020 will be flat or in the low single-digits. However, we've remained confident that we will have a stronger growth year with E&C's than in fiscal year 2019 supported by the nearing of the end of their renewal cycle of our contracts and the continued strength from incremental CapEx spend on LNG projects. As discussed on recent earnings calls, the uncertainty caused by the global trade conflict and deceleration of global growth in calendar 2019 has increasingly affected business conditions for mainly of our chemical customers. Despite these factors, we're encouraged by the solid growth in annual spend achieved in this vertical. We expect announcement of the Phase 1 trade agreement between the U.S and China and a better economic outlook in calendar 2020 will improve the macro environment for these customers. Throughout the quarter, I spoke with a number of chemical executives and they continue to view investments in the digitalization as one of their most important long-term priorities. Turning to APM. At the midpoint of the year, it has contributed 0.64 point to our year-to-date annual spend growth. While APM growth has always been expected to be back end loaded in fiscal year '20, we're somewhat behind where we expected to be at the midpoint of the year. During the second quarter, we had several transactions we expected to close in the quarter that pushed out to the second half of the fiscal year. We remain confident in our ability to deliver approximately 3 points of annual spend growth from our APM business in fiscal 2020. Our confidence is driven by the following factors we expect to happen in the second half of the fiscal year. First, transaction that is slipped from the second quarter will close; second, the increasing maturation of our APM pipeline as more proof-of-concepts are concluded, resulting in customers coming to buying decisions: third, enterprise or multi-sized transactions that are larger than our average transaction are targeted for closure; and fourth, a growing GI business for APM with a number of transactions targeted to close. Of these factors, signing enterprise or multi-site opportunities will be the biggest driver of our second half performance and our ability to achieve our full-year APM growth target. We have a number of this opportunities in our pipeline and our forecast for fiscal 2020, as always anticipated, closing some of this transactions throughout the year. Overall, we are pleased with our business performance in the first half of the year. Our ability to deliver double-digit growth in the quarter with heightened uncertainty in one of our core verticals is an important valuation of the value AspenTech delivers for customers and the mission-critical nature of our solution. I would now like to share a few examples of contracts we closed in the quarter. First, a European Oil & Chemicals company and long-term user of our engineering and MSC Suites, selected AspenTech's supply chain management solution to be deployed across its chemical assets, and integrated with our existing planning solution in its refining business. As part of its digital program, these customers chemical business was looking for a global solution to maximize its business margin, while providing high customer service levels. AspenTech Solution was selected over that of three other established supply chain management software providers in the market. Second, one of our largest E&C customers headquartered in Europe has committed to take our Aspen Mtell product to market with the objective of building a high-margin revenue stream, and its operation and maintenance crew targeting the brownfield assets of its customers. This commitment to Aspen Mtell expensive relationship with this customer into a partnership, where the customer will promote the use of the Mtell capabilities to our common customers and others, and will take on the implementation and support of the product once installed. Third, a North America based chemical customer selected are soon to be released latest generation, planning and scheduling solution after a detailed evaluation of the capabilities of these new product and one of our competitive. This customer plans to replace an in-house developed excel-based planning solution. The AspenTech sales team identified projected benefits in excess of $70 million at the customers three U.S sites when the technology is fully rolled out. Fourth, U.S based oil and gas upstream company selected Aspen Mtell after a detailed sole source evaluation of the product for the selected Aspen Mtell after a detailed sole source evaluation of the product for deployment at two offshore oil production platforms in the U.S and Southeast Asia as part of an initial Phase 1 deployment. The customer is focused on increasing the productivity of their existing assets by generating more volume from existing data. This is one of four digital initiatives in place by the customer. And fifth and final, a North American based chemical producer formed a digital group in 2019 to evaluate the use of in-house and new technologies throughout the business to increase value creation. The digital group identified in excess of $100 million in value creation opportunities in the operations space. After a careful evaluation of internal capabilities and the Aspen ProMV product, the customer decided to select Aspen ProMV for rollout across multiple sites due to superior analytical capabilities and its ease of use, especially for online applications. Value capture from other AspenTech product has already been identified and will become part of the digital group initiatives. As we look to the second half of the year, we're confident about a stronger growth performance and continue to maintain our full-year annual spend guidance. Our confidence is driven by the volume and quality of the pipeline of business in the Q3 and Q4 quarters. The expectation of a more favorable environment for chemical customers, a continued improvement in the growth of the E&C business as we get closer to the end of the contracts renewal cycle, a continuation of the strength of our refining business and increasing contribution to growth by the GI verticals because of the applicability of the APM suite in that space. We also expect attrition to track within the 3.5% to 4.5% range, we guided to at the beginning of the fiscal year. From a product perspective, we continue to make good progress on our investments, in artificial intelligence and data driven applications. Specifically, we are making good progress integrating the new technology stack into the architecture of our future solutions to leverage cloud and edge computing capabilities to support enterprise deployments. We believe there is a significant opportunity to bring to market a new generation of solutions that can substantially increase the value creation across customers assets, representing new value creation opportunities for AspenTech. We continue to make progress in the partners area with meaningful new and existing relationships coming together. This includes the integration of work happening between Hexagon's PPM solutions and AspenTech solutions with significant customer interest and involvement in the process. We are also engaged in formal joint go-to-market activities with a global consulting firm actively promoting our Aspen Mtell and Aspen GDOT products to the sea level suites of our customers. More recently we signed a relationship agreement with one of the global implementation services firms to access its vast network of implementation resources for our products and solutions. We continue to successfully balance investing in our product portfolio as well as our sales capacity, while maintaining our strong levels of profitability. The rigor with which we evaluate investment opportunities and our willingness to reallocate existing investment dollars before commit an incremental capital to new projects; allows us to effectively deliver both a strong growth and margins. Karl will provide more detail in a few minutes, but we are increasing our free cash flow guidance for fiscal 2020, to reflect lower-than-expected tax payments. Before I wrap up, I want to provide an update on our senior management team and Board of Directors. I'm excited to announce that John Hague who has been leading our APM business unit as we promoted to Executive Vice President of Operations. In this role, John is responsible for the global sales, customer success, product marketing and partners organizations as well as continuing to lead our APM business unit. John has been a valued member of the AspenTech team for more than 25 years in a variety of leadership positions, including Head of North America, and Latin-American sales and head of our operations in the Middle East and North Africa based in Bahrain for five years. We also recently added exciting edge computing on IoT domain expertise with the appointment of Dr. Tom Bradicich to AspenTech's Board of Directors. Currently he is the Vice President, Hewlett-Packard fellow and Global Head of Edge and IoT Labs and center of excellence for Hewlett-Packard enterprise and was instrumental in establishing HPE's IoT capabilities. I'm happy to welcome Tom to AspenTech and believe he will complement and enhance the strategic value of our Board of Directors. Finally, earlier today we published our 2020 environmental, social and governance report, a look at AspenTech's continued commitment to delivering exceptional value to all our stakeholders. You can download the report from our website at www.aspentech.com. To wrap up, AspenTech delivered solid second quarter result and we believe we're well positioned to achieve our full-year annual spend growth and profitability outlook. We are successfully executing against an evolving macro environment and have continued to generate double-digit annual spend growth. We believe, we are in the early stages of a significant investment cycle around digitalization technologies in our core markets and GEIs. We are confident that AspenTech is well positioned to benefit from this strength and our focus on executing on the growth opportunities ahead of us. With that, let me turn the call over to Karl. Karl? Hi, Rob. Yes. Well, I mean, Rob, just as a reminder, in Q3 of FY '19 we closed a large enterprise deal with APM. That customer -- the proof-of-concept, an extended proof-of-concept and went straight into a full enterprise deal, so in a way it has not follow the pattern that we're seeing with all of our customers which is they buy the licenses for one or two sites, and eventually, after a year or two, they start thinking about increasing to more sites or an enterprise deal. If you look at the trajectory of the APM business, its 2.5 years old now since we formally launched it in July of 2018. And the fact is that now these customers that are ready to expand the scope of the deployment of Aspen Mtell are now looking at multi-site or enterprise style type deal. So the expectation is that we would see -- we have them in the pipeline. We've been working then and we know they're in Q3, Q4. One of the deals that pushed out from Q2 was a customer that was expanding to more sites from originally two sites. So I think as time has passed now the opportunity exists to start closing some of these deals. Thank you. Hi, Steve. Well, I mean, look, from a standpoint of the slipping pattern, I think it's consistent with what we've seen in the past and we've talked about it. These were larger deals as they were coming through final approvals, more questions came up from the executive suites, Chief Digital Officers and for greater inspection of those deals. Verticals, primarily upstream, where we're getting traction now with APM and some of it in chemicals as well. Hi, Matt. Well, I mean look, the fact is that despite our concerns with sort of the deteriorating macro environment for chemical customers in the second half of last year, especially in the Q4 quarter, we had a solid quarter for our chemicals business. Our expectation and expectation of our customers as we talk to them is, especially with the uncertainty around trade diminution and an improving sort of global economic growth outlook that they will start seeing better demand. And the fact is that if you look at the announcement, the earnings announcement from Dow, chemicals they've talked in that announcement already about seeing better demand in the January month. As you listen to the earnings results, certainly for the last quarter and the full-year that they're reporting, they had very poor results, but they're now starting to see improvement in the demand for their product. So I think this will happen over time here as the year progresses, but within expectation. Well, I mean, look at the partnerships that we announced around of E&C's they get reflected on the business relationship that we've with that customer as they buy APM entitlement to access the products to deploy them as some of this products are getting sold, and then they have to be deployed. The aspect of those relationships with the E&C is that roll-in -- just promoting the technology, but more importantly the implementation because they want to be able to rollout these technologies. With Hexagon is work in progress because we've been working on the integration of our products and there's a lot of customer excitement that work has to be done and completed. And then once we release that integration is when we will start seeing the benefit from it. And then some of these new relationships that are more recent with a global consulting firm and the global implementation services firm, its only the last 6 months with the former that we would be going to market and with the implementation firm, really, in the last couple of months only. So hopefully, we will start seeing the impact of those over the next 6 to 12 months. Thank you, Matt. Hi, Jack. Yes. Well, look, the fact is that those multi-site or enterprise deals are the outcome of a selection of technology that has already happened 6ix months, 12 months, 18 months ago. We have been working with the customer to provide the technology and then the customer is working with us and then it's sort of sole-source negotiation. We normally don't see competition in those type of deals, but again because it's new technology, it's new capabilities, is getting deployed into areas where these customers will have to change their business processes, their practices and so on. It requires greater preparation by these customers to absorb the technology. But the type of deals themselves attract more attention as a result of being new spend in new technology. And we've discussed these over the last 12 months. It is a phenomena that we continue to see. No, I don't think so. Our business in the Middle East performed well in the last quarter and we've a solid outlook for it this quarter as well. Yes. Hi, Jason. Yes. Yes. Well, I mean, look, I think certainly I think the last couple of years CapEx spend in upstream has been sort mid single-digits. This year it looks like it might be flat to low single-digit. So there is a benefit from that. Certainly the attrition rate with our E&C's is coming down as we are completing the renewal of all those contracts and we are nearing the end of the renewal cycle. And then I believe E&C's are benefiting from an increasing CapEx spend to build LNG facilities, not only in the United States but around the world. And it's expected between 2019 and 2025, there will be another $200 billion in CapEx spend in LNG. And I think that's flowing through the E&C companies at the moment. Thank you, Jason. Hi, Andrew. Well, look, I do think there's elasticity in our pricing. We certainly create a lot of value for our customers and you figure that for that value, there will be greater upside. Well the fact is that there is competition in the market and sort of tends to create sort of a optimum pricing for our products. As we have stated in the past, we do see ourselves as sort of the premium priced software supplier in this market, and it's something that we continuously monitor to make sure that we are aligned with our customers and the market. Look, APM -- the pricing for APM, we have learned a lot over 2 years now, 2.5 years. We believe we've the right pricing for our products, especially vis-a\u0300-vis value they create, but we are also monitoring some of those competitors that we see in this space because in a way, there's learning that is happening. There is a new competitors that show up other that were incumbents and so we were very much aware of the pricing that its happening in the market and we are satisfied with where we are with our pricing. Yes. Andrew, in the past what we have said is that because if deals -- generally, this is new technology into new areas of this customer's organization sort of the maintenance area where they are buying technology of this type for the first time. So its new technology, it is new spend and the size of these deals tends to be such that they get visibility of the C-suite and what we found in the past and we saw in Q2 as well, there is more questions that come about out of the C-suite. We try to address that in the past by certainly moving our engagement and making sure we have a sponsorship at the C-suite, not always possible. So we ended up again in a situation where there were a few more questions being asked as these deals get to the final approval stages. And we are working to -- with the customer to provide the information that they need. Yes. Yes. Thank you. Hi, Mark. No, not really. Like I said already, these where transactions that we were in discussions with the customer on a sole source basis. We've been -- these customers have already been -- I mean, one of them has already been using our technology for over a year. The other one is certainly a new customer, but we have already been passed the process with the competition and we are in the middle of negotiating and finalizing those deals forward. Yes. Look, there is high aspirations for GDOT. We signed our first GDOT license agreement with a chemical customer in North America. We do not have chemical references for the technology really anywhere and in North America we signed a first license. We expect Q3 and Q4 to have a larger sample of GDOT transactions getting signed. Thank you. Hi, Jackson, again. Yes. No, as a matter of fact that this is the second type of these customers that have turned partners, if you will. The first one was an North America based E&C company, also one of the largest ones in the world. This is the second one, European-based and one of the largest E&C company. Our expectation is we will be signing a few more of those in the future, yes. Yes. Thank you, Jackson. Okay. Well, thank everyone for joining the call today and as always Karl and I look forward to meeting you when we go visit the different cities. Thank you."

            "name": "Karl Johnsen",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter fiscal 2020 results for the period ending December 31, 2019. I'm Karl Johnsen, CFO of AspenTech, and with me on the call today is Antonio Pietri, President and CEO. Before we begin, I will make the Safe Harbor statement that during the course of this call, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from such projections or statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's call and in our Form 10-Q for the second fiscal quarter of 2020, which is now on file with the SEC. Also, please note that the following information is related to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, January 29, 2019. Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. The structure of today's call will be as follows. Antonio will discuss business highlights from the second quarter, and then I'll review our financial results and provide our guidance for fiscal year 2020. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio? Thanks, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the second quarter fiscal 2020. As a reminder, these results are being reported under topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings, and more specifically, renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods, resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years. And this nonlinearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods. In our view, annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business and annual free cash flow, the most important metric for assessing the overall value our business generates. Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for our term license agreement at the end of each period was approximately $564 million at the end of the second quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis and 3% sequentially. Total bookings, which we define as the total value of customer term license contracts signed in the current period less the value of term license contracts signed in the current period, but where the initial licenses are not yet deemed delivered under topic 606, plus term license contracts signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period was $112.3 million, a 27% decrease year-over-year. The year-over-year decrease in bookings reflect a decrease in the amount of term license contracts, up for renewal as compared to the year-ago period. Total revenue was $124.7 million for the second quarter, an 11% decline from the prior year period. The year-over-year decrease in revenue was a result of the decrease in total bookings discussed previously. Turning to profitability, beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $67.5 million, which was up from $61.9 million in the year-ago period. Total expenses, including cost of revenue were $83.1 million, which was up from $76.7 million in the year-ago period and down from $86.8 million last quarter. The year-over-year expense increase reflect the impact of the organic investments we've been making in the business as well as the impact of the Nuvo and Sabisu acquisitions. Operating income was $41.7 million and net income for the quarter was $38.3 million or $0.56 per share. Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition related fees, we report -- we reported non-GAAP operating income of $50.9 million, representing a 40.8% non-GAAP operating margin compared to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $71.2 million and 50.7%, respectively in the year-ago period. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period-to-period due to the timing of customer renewals, and therefore license revenue recognized during the quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $45.5 million or $0.66 per share based on 68.8 million shares outstanding. Turning to cash flow. We generated $46.9 million of cash from operations and $48.1 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and acquisition related payments. The reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables within our press release, which is also available on our website. I would now like to close with guidance. Please note that we are reiterating our guidance for all metrics, except for net income, free cash flow, GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS. Recall that we only provide guidance on an annual basis to provide directional commentary on the timing of annual spend and bookings during the year. Full guidance for our income statement metrics can be found in our earnings press release. With respect to annual spend, as s Antonio mentioned, we continue to forecast 10% to 12% annual spend growth in fiscal 2020. Of that, 7% to 9% is expected to come from our engineering and MSC suite and approximately 3% from APM. We continue to expect bookings to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million, which includes $317 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2020. As a reminder, under topic 606, our license revenue recognition is tied to when we recognize bookings. As such, our license revenue linearity will generally track to the bookings linearity. From an expense perspective, we continue to expect total GAAP expenses of $369 million to $374 million and non-GAAP expenses of $303 million to $308 million. From a free cash flow perspective, we are updating our free cash flow guidance to $260 million to $270 million compared to our prior outlook of $250 million to $260 million. Our updated free cash flow guidance reflects lower anticipated cash tax payments of $45 million to $50 million as compared to our prior view of $55 million to $60 million. The lower cash tax payments are a function of a change in when we are required to make cash tax payments related to the implementation of topic 606. Originally, we are required to pay the cash taxes associated with the adoption of topic 606 in fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020. New guidance was issued by the IRS in the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, it allows for cash tax payments associated with our adoption of topic 606 to be paid equally in fiscal years 2019 through 2022. From a timing perspective, we anticipate free cash flow in fiscal year 2020 to follow a season -- seasonal pattern similar to fiscal year 2019. We're updating our GAAP and non-GAAP EPS guidance to reflect the impact of an increase to our estimated full-year tax rate, which we now expect to be approximately 19% as well as the impact of the shares repurchased in the second quarter. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $2.68 to $3.09, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $3.43 to $3.84. In summary, we delivered solid second quarter results. We believe, we're on track to achieve our full-year financial target and we're well positioned to continue delivering an attractive combination of growth and profitability that can generate sustained value for shareholders over time. With that, we would now like to begin the Q&A. Operator? Yes. I think, Rob, that's a big piece of it. But again, the year is playing out very much like we thought it would, where it's going to be a little bit heavy -- heavily weighted toward the back half. APM, as Antonio mentioned, a little bit behind where we wanted it to be at this point of the year. So that's a piece of it, but I would say the engineering and the MSC businesses were strong and came in generally in line with what we thought they would. So I think bookings we said about 40% to 45% would come in the first half of the year, and we are right around 40% if you were to take the kind of the midpoint of our guidance for bookings. So we're right about where we thought. But with the kind of annual spending a little bit behind where we thought it would be, it's really the growth bookings, the renewals came in pretty much like we thought they were would come in. So that came in pretty much in line. It was more along the lines of some of the growth that Antonio mentioned slipping into the second half of the year. Thank you. It was -- it's a little bit of seasonality in sales and marketing, because in Q1 we have our sales kickoff meeting. You typically see that drop off a little bit and then a little bit of timing of our marketing events."

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Karl Johnsen, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nKarl Johnsen: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our first quarter fiscal 2020 results for the period ending September 30, 2019.

Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. The structure of today's call will be as follows. Antonio will discuss business highlights from the first quarter and I'll review our financial results and provide our guidance for fiscal year 2020. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks, Karl, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. AspenTech is off to a good start to the year. The demand trends seen in Q1 show continued strength across end markets, product suite and geographies supporting increasing pipeline volume for our MSC and APM businesses and the continued recovery of the pipeline of business for the engineering suite, all in line with the growth trends experienced in late fiscal 2018 and throughout fiscal 2019. We're benefiting from multiple growth drivers that we believe position us well to achieve our full year growth and profitability objectives.  I would like to begin my remarks by looking at our financial highlights for the quarter. For the first quarter, revenue was $134.1 million. GAAP EPS was $0.67, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.79. Annual spend was $548 million, up 1.3% in the quarter and 10% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $14.3 million, and we returned $50 million to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 382,000 shares.  As I stated before, from a macro perspective, we continue to see positive demand trends across the business. The need to invest in technology to support digitalization initiatives is one of the most significant long-term trends in capital-intensive industries. Customers increasingly recognize that to achieve their business and financial objectives and remain competitive over the long term, they need to deploy technology that provides powerful insights into how their assets operate, to enable greater asset uptime and operational efficiency.  A good example of this is the chemicals industry. As noted on our last earnings call, we are mindful of the indications that the global trade conflict is having an impact on global chemical demand. During the past couple of months, I met with executives of many of our chemicals customers who have knowledge that their business has become more challenging. However, their feedback is that they remain focused on investing in their digitalization initiatives, which they believe is critical for their businesses and their long-term competitiveness.  Our APM business had a good start to the year, with significant growth achieved across this suite. In particular, Aspen ProMV had its second consecutive record quarter. Trends remain favorable, with growing customer interest in the suite and rising levels of sales activity. It is becoming apparent that the value proposition of the APM suite is resonating with customers, and they recognize the substantial benefits it can deliver for their business. For example, Aspen Mtell has differentiated itself in two key ways: superior accuracy and effectiveness and faster time to value. Mtell's Racy is driven by the deep insights it provides from data about the anomalies it detects. While there are other solutions that can detect anomalies, their inability to provide a contextual understanding of what the data means, limits their value.  Mtell delivers faster time to value as it rapidly scaled from one asset to many assets in a plant size or globally across the enterprise. Mtell deployments are automated and do not require specialized data science skills or significant time to implement and support.  The net result is that Mtell has a demonstrated track record of detecting anomalies early and identifying potential issues that other solutions miss. Doing so with more precision, accuracy and ease of deployment and use than its competitors.  Looking at other primary markets. The E&C trends seen in fiscal 2019 continue to manifest themselves in the first quarter. These trends are supported by CapEx growth at a mid- single-digit rate and incremental LNG CapEx investments that are driving the backlog duration metric for the E&Cs we track above its long-term trend. We believe the recent positive trend with E&C customers will continue. And as we come to the end of the renewal cycle for our contracts with these customers, we expect to see further improvement in the growth rate of that business.  Our refining customers remain a stalwart in the adoption of asset optimization solutions in support of their continuous focus on operational excellence. As mentioned earlier, digitalization remains a top strategic priority for these customers and AspenTech is a key enabling technology partner for these initiatives.  A group of these customers is also reconfiguring or implementing new operating strategies in the refineries to benefit from new stringent sulfur content regulation on maritime transportation fuel under the IMO 2020 requirements that dramatically reduce sulphur dioxide content in bunker fuel. The reconfiguration of refineries or adoption of new operating strategies can be achieved through a combination of CapEx spend and the use of technologies like PIMS-AO, GDOT and others, which all benefit AspenTech. I would now like to share a few examples of contracts we closed in the quarter. First, a chemicals customer in Latin America and a long-term user of our engineering and manufacturing supply chain suite signed an agreement after a detailed evaluation to use and deploy the Aspen Fidelis, Mtell and ProMV products in our Asset Performance Management suite at one of their petrochemical sites. The customer is facing issues with the quality and reliability of their feedstock, which coupled with equipment reliability issues, has created a challenging operating environment. The customer was seeking solutions to understand process degradation and equipment reliability problems in order to achieve better efficiencies in the operation of the plant.  Second, a mining customer in Asia and a long-term user of our Manufacturing Execution System selected the Aspen Mtell solution upon completion of a detailed sole source evaluation and successful pilot and after considering offerings from at least two other suppliers as part of their digitalization transformation initiative.  The customer is looking to improve reliability by reducing unplanned downtime in their operations. A partner of AspenTech executed the pilot with the customer and is now focused on the implementation of that technology in the customers' copper manufacturing facility. Further rollout of the technology is expected to other metals manufacturing facilities and mining operations. This engagement model is a demonstration of the progress we are making to establish an ecosystem for the successful testing and implementation of Mtell.  Third, an integrated oil company in Canada and long-term user of our engineering and MSC suites selected Aspen Mtell after initially conducting an evaluation of multiple vendors and then narrowing the process to 3 finalists. The customer set up a group dedicated to evaluating technologies not currently used by the company that could deliver significant incremental value.  A business case was jointly developed for a refinery that identified over $10 million in annual benefits through lost profit opportunities and maintenance spend reduction. Also, a second upstream site was included in this study showing similar benefit potential.  The initial deployment will be to these 2 sites and will be performed by a partner of AspenTech. The successful deployment of Aspen Mtell is expected to lead to the industrialization of the product across all the company's assets.  Fourth, one of the largest tire manufacturers with plants around the world and user of our supply chain management product decided to evaluate new solutions in the marketplace as their business needs have evolved, requiring planned scheduling optimization. After the customer first conducted a failed pilot with a competitor's product, our team worked with the customer to show the enhanced functionality of our plant scheduling products, Aspen Plant Scheduling Enhanced Automation, or Aspen PSEA, and Aspen Plant Scheduling Enhanced Optimization, or Aspen PSEO, in the aspenONE version 11 software release. After proving out the new capabilities to the customer, they decided to move forward with our products, signing a new agreement that commits to the rollout of the Aspen PSEO product for their primary site and Aspen PSEA product for their secondary sites.  Fifth and final, a long-term European customer of AspenTech has committed to increasing the use of Aspentech's refinery planning and branding solution, PMSO and multi-brand optimization and MBO as part of its strategy to meet IMO 2020 specifications in maritime fuel production due to its strategic proximity to shipping lanes. This is in the context of a broader dealer transformation program to capture potential margin optimization opportunities, each of which represent millions of dollars in profitability.  Moving on to the products area. We recently announced the launch of Aspen Enterprise Insights, a visualization and workflow management solution that aggregates and analyzes data from across the enterprise to deliver insights and actionable information and drive better collaboration and decision making within organizations. This release incorporates the technology from the Sabisu acquisition last quarter and is an important example of the type of collaborative and data-driven applications we're focused on introducing to the market.  Based on initial feedback from customers, we anticipate a strong interest and the capabilities of this technology to help customers aggregate, analyze and visualize information across their enterprises. Early customer feedback on the acquired capabilities of Nuvo and Sabisu and our broader vision for AI and machine learning has been very positive. Customers recognize that deploying these technologies has the potential to lead to better understanding of how to drive higher levels of operational excellence across their assets.  We're working on integrating the Nuvo technology stack into the architecture of our future solutions to enable their enterprise deployment through cloud capabilities. And over time, also via edge computing capabilities. In addition, we will continue to sell the Nuvo technology stack as an OEM solution into their historical verticals, which all fall under the global economy industries of AspenTech.  We also continue to make incremental investments in our product portfolio and our sales capacity for APM to fully capitalize on our growth opportunities. The combination of our scalable business model and rigorous ROI-based investment methodology allows us to effectively manage the balance between spending for growth and continue to maintain our strong profitability levels.  We will continue to utilize our balance sheet and allocate capital to invest in our organic growth initiatives, pursue acquisitions and execute on our share repurchase program. To summarize, AspenTech head off to a good start in fiscal 2020, and we believe we're well positioned to achieve our full year growth and profitability outlook. We're executing well on our strategic growth initiative and believe we will continue generating an attractive combination of growth and profitability for the foreseeable future as customers continue to invest in digitalization, in our core market and GEIs. We're confident this will generate significant value for long-term shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Karl. Karl?\nKarl Johnsen: Thanks, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. As a reminder, these results are being reported under Topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings, and more specifically, renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years, and this nonlinearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods.  In our view, annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business and annual free cash flow, the most important metric for assessing the overall value our business generates.  Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for our term license agreement at the end of each period with approximately $548 million at the end of the first quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis and 1.3% sequentially.  Total bookings, which we define as the total value of customer term license contracts signed in the current period, less the value of term license contracts signed in the current period but where the initial licenses are not yet deemed delivered under Topic 606. Plus term license contracts signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period was $135 million, a 40.4% increase year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in bookings reflects a significant increase in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal as compared to the year-ago period. Total revenue was $134.1 million for the first quarter, a 17.4% increase from the prior year period. The year-over-year increase in revenue was a result of the increase in total bookings discussed above.  Turning to profitability, beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $71.6 million, which was up from $64 million in the year-ago period. Total expenses, including cost of revenue were $86.8 million, which was up from $77.2 million in the year-ago period, and $84.5 million last quarter. The increase in expenses is primarily related to the organic investments we're making in fiscal year 2020 as well as the impact of our recent Nuvo and Sabisu acquisitions.  Operating income was $47.3 million, and net income for the quarter was $46.3 million or $0.67 per share. Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition-related fees, we reported non-GAAP operating income of $57.9 million, representing a 43.2% non-GAAP operating margin compared to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $46.9 million and 41.1%, respectively, in the year-ago period. The margin performance reflects the positive impact of the incremental license revenue recognized during the quarter. Given the fluctuations in our revenue due to the timing of bookings, we believe focusing on annual free cash flow as a percentage of annual spend is the most appropriate way to assess the efficiency of our performance in a period. Non-GAAP net income was $54.6 million or $0.79 per share based on 69.3 million shares outstanding.  Turning to cash flow. We generated $15.3 million of cash from operations and $14.3 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capital software -- capitalized software, litigation and acquisition-related payments. Free cash flow is ahead of our expectations due to a better-than-expected collections within the quarter.  A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables within our press release, which is also available on our website. I would now like to close with guidance. Please note that we are reiterating our guidance for all metrics except for GAAP and non-GAAP EPS, which are increasing to reflect the impact of shares we repurchased in the first quarter. Recall that we only provide guidance on an annual basis and provide directional commentary on the timing of annual spend and bookings during the year. Full guidance for our income statement metrics can be found in our earnings press release.  With respect to annual spend growth, as Antonio mentioned, we continue to forecast 10% to 12% annual spend growth for fiscal 2020. Of that, 7% to 9% is expected to come from our engineering and MSC suites and approximately 3% from APM. Similar to fiscal 2019, we anticipate growth in annual spend will be weighted to the second half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect bookings to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million, which includes $317 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2020. From a linearity perspective, as mentioned at our Investor Day, we still anticipate 40% to 45% of fiscal year 2020 bookings to come in the first half of the year, with the remainder in the second half.  As a reminder, on the Topic 606, our license revenue recognition is tied to when we recognize bookings, as such, our license revenue linearity will generally track to the bookings linearity. From an expense perspective, we continue to expect total GAAP expenses of $369 million to $374 million and non-GAAP expenses of $303 million to $308 million. From a free cash flow perspective, we're expecting to generate $250 million to $260 million. Our fiscal 2020 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments of approximately $55 million to $60 million. Our 2020 free cash flow outlook reflects the impact of incremental investments we are making in the business. From a timing perspective, we anticipate free cash flow to follow a seasonal pattern similar to fiscal 2019.  In summary, we began fiscal 2020, benefiting from the same trends we have seen in recent quarters. We believe we are well positioned to continue delivering an attractive combination of growth and profitability that can generate sustained value for the shareholders over time.  With that, we'd like -- we would now like to begin the Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird.\nRobert Oliver: I just wanted to kick off on APM. So I know coming out of the Analyst Day in August, it sounded as if the shift from kind of one-off equipment licenses to site licenses was helping to drive higher retention rates and I was wondering if we can get -- if we could get any color around that if that continues. And then I just had one follow-up on some of the wins that you referred to as well.\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I mean, look we -- the specifics that we normally give around APM are at the half year mark of the fiscal year to account for whatever variability happens between quarters. But our pipeline continues to reflect an increasing number of multi-side or enterprise style deals. In Q1, we signed more new customers to the use of both Mtell, ProMV and Fidelis, and we were very happy with the acceleration of that business versus Q1 FY '19. That's what I will say about that.\nRobert Oliver: And Antonio, on those customers, thanks, there was a lot of data you guys always give us on the customer front. Outside of maybe the tire company you mentioned or maybe they are a customer. It seems like all of them are already current Aspen customers on MSC or engineering suites so that sort of illustrates the power of incumbency. You mentioned that a lot of these initial lands were only in one area and could be rolled out across, for example, in the mining area across multiple different metals and areas. When you look at these opportunities without putting a dollar figure on it, what sort of multiplier do you think you have on that initial land within the contract?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well look, I think it's multiple times. It depends on the number of assets the customers have to further roll out the technology. In the case of the customers multiple sites, in the case of the customer in Canada it's not only refineries but upstream operations. In mining, we talked about a customer that was rolling the technology out already to 7 different mines. You have customers in chemicals that have multiple chemical plants. So the multiple is -- the potential for annual spend growth is multiple times what we get out of the initial land in deal. And that is now starting to get reflected on the APM pipeline, which is continuing to grow and is as large as it's ever been since we started this business almost 2.5 years ago now. Yes, Rob, I don't know if it's something wrong with your line, but we're getting a noise or typing or maybe it's -- yes...\nRobert Oliver: Yes, that's probably me just taking notes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Hynes from Canaccord.\nDavid Hynes: Antonio, I wanted to ask you about the chemicals' customers and what you're seeing in the end market. I think you offered an anecdotal comment that they're going to continue to invest in digitization efforts. But I'm curious what you're seeing in the field today? I mean, are you seeing any signs of those folks pushing off decisions, making smaller commitments? I guess, kind of what has been the manifestation of a more challenging environment in your sales execution?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, and that's the point, DJ, that we really haven't seen any change in their -- in the cadence of business from these chemical customers. They're all certainly talking about the difficult macro environment and deterioration of some of their end -- some of their businesses, but across the board, there's a commitment to adoption of digital capabilities and driving operational excellence. So we're encouraged by what we're hearing, despite the macro environment that these chemical customers are seeing or experiencing.\nDavid Hynes: Got it. And then maybe one follow-up on APM. The product's been in the market for a little while now, and I think you had said in the past that early days, customers would get some early adopters' discounting. Have you seen any -- or have you pushed any evolution and kind of the pricing model there as you kind of think about more value-based pricing? And have you been able to kind of drive better economics on the deals that you're signing now versus maybe where you were a year ago?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I mean look at -- I think we said from the very beginning that we're trying to be ambitious with our pricing from the get-go. And certainly, there was -- we were testing the -- our pricing in the market. And as such, we've made adjustments more. Specifically, depending on the end market as you move away from the process industries, you tend to see less value creation because of profitability, lower profitability in other industries. And then the other adjustment that's happened is certainly there's competitors out in the market that perhaps don't necessarily follow value-based pricing, but nonetheless, we continue to experience good pricing. I believe at Investor Day, we talked about how every API transaction is increasing the total wallet spend or amount of spend by those customers with respect to our engineering and MSC business.  So look, we were satisfied with the value we're getting. We've done an enterprise deal, and we're very happy with that value. And I think going forward, the thing that we need to demonstrate more often is our ability to price enterprise deals at a multiple of what we're doing these initial deals, which I think will be the case. But no, I -- from day one, we always felt we were going to go to market with value-based pricing.  And the other thing is that we're proving that the value is significant because some of these customers are telling us that through the 1 or 2 saves that they achieved after they implement Mtell, they are recovering the cost of the investment. And that alone says, okay, there is an opportunity perhaps to do a little bit more. But at the same time, we think we're getting good value for what we're selling.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Koenig from Wedbush.\nSteven Koenig: Maybe a numbers question for Karl, and then one for Antonio. So just on the numbers, we're going to get a better feel for RPO cadence over time, I guess it's probably typical for it to be down sequentially in a Q1. And then just on the bookings metric, should we -- I guess, by your kind of the seasonality help that you gave us. It kind of looks like given the renewal schedule, we should see bookings kind of down year-on-year for the next 3 quarters if I'm doing my math right. So that's that. And then I got one kind of a higher-level question for and Antonio, if you don't mind.\nKarl Johnsen: Sure. So you broke up on the first part of that question. Could you do -- ask that again, Steve?\nSteven Koenig: Okay, yes. RPO being down sequentially in the Q1, that's probably a typical cadence, is that fair?\nKarl Johnsen: Steven. Just for my clarification, what do you mean by RPO?\nSteven Koenig: The remaining performance obligation. Looked like it was down sequentially. And is that normal for a Q1?\nKarl Johnsen: Are you talking about the contract asset the unbilled?\nSteven Koenig: No. No, I talk about the...\nKarl Johnsen: What are you trying to as the remaining -- I'm not following what you mean by the remaining performance obligation.\nSteven Koenig: Okay. Maybe that is the contract. Maybe you guys are using different terminology. Not the unbilled receivable. We can take it offline in the follow-up. That's fine. Maybe just on bookings, though. Looks like given the renewal schedule, your bookings should be kind of down year-on-year in the next 3 quarters. Is that -- it might be on my math right on that?\nKarl Johnsen: Yes. So yes, it's kind of -- as we said, the bookings, we've got like 40%, 45% in the first half, the rest will come in a second. So you can figure out the math on what that will look like by the quarters. And as a little -- as I said before, there's some timing in that, which might move stuff between the quarters. But in general, I'd use that split between the two.\nSteven Koenig: Okay. Great. And then if I may, I wanted to ask Antonio about the Enterprise Insight announcement. Maybe can you -- so that -- we saw that about a month ago, it looks interesting. Could you tell us how does this differ from Aspen's existing analytics capabilities? Is it -- does it provide kind of an ad hoc capability that's new? Or what is new with it? And maybe a little color on what kind of use cases you expect to see out of it? And any signs of initial traction on it?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Okay. Good. So Aspen Enterprise Insights formerly Sabisu. Look, so Aspen Enterprise Insights is a enterprise visualization and workflow management capability. So it has some analytics capabilities but very rudimentary. It's really about what Aspen Enterprise Insights allows is it's a -- very tactically pull information from any system in your enterprise, aggregate it, do analytics on it or message that information to then visualize it and do that as part of a workflow collaboration process that then supports decision making and actions. When we talk about our own analytics solutions. These are heavy analytics solutions that are very localized in a plant on assets. What then Aspen Enterprise Insights does, it allows you to elevate all that information and then make it available to anyone on the enterprise. So for example, customers could want to do benchmarking between different plants, they maybe want to do benchmarking between similar type of assets across different plants. Also maybe we have Mtell on a compressor on a plant and in multiple plants. So the customer can elevate that information, aggregate it and then put it on a dashboard so that you can compare the performance of that compressor across multiple plants and the alerts that Mtell might be generating. So it's about data aggregation, analysis and visualization within a collaborative workflow environment to allow for decision making and taking actions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader from JPMorgan.\nJackson Ader: First, Antonio, kind of a high-level question on E&C. I know you said that growth rates are pretty consistent that you mentioned at the Analyst Day a couple of months ago in kind of all three of your major segments, but I'm just curious, if we rewind 12 months ago, we're in the middle of a pretty precipitous drop in the price of oil. So I'm just curious, what are you seeing now in terms of budget at your E&C customers and whether things are hardening, softening, can you just compare and contrast what it looks like today versus last year?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I mean, Jackson. So I'm going to try to recollect from memory the price of oil 12 months ago, but I believe we were more or less in the same range, sort of range bound between call it $50 and $80, maybe it was a little higher a year ago, somewhere in that $70 range. I don't think dramatically different from where we are today. And really, at this time last year, with those E&C customers were completing their budgets for calendar 2019, we are now at the end of calendar 2019 and their spend was given by that budget that was set now a year ago. Those customers are now working on their budgets for calendar 2020, and that will be the real determinant of then growth in the next calendar year or the second half of our FY '20. So far, so good as far as the same trend that we saw through our fiscal '19.  Now new budgets are going to come into place for these customers in January of next year. And I will start dictating then our -- their spend on the second half of our fiscal year. Hopefully, I answered your question.\nJackson Ader: Yes, yes. No, that's helpful. About the same is completely fine. Yes, that's helpful. Karl, just a quick follow-up. Should we -- if collections maybe came in a little bit better than you had been expecting, and that's what caused the free cash flow to come in better as well. Should we read that as also maybe renewals came in, maybe the timing of renewals came in better than expected? Or should we kind of leave those two separate?\nKarl Johnsen: Yes, leave them separate. I mean, the bookings came in about where we thought they would come in for the quarter. It was really just, as we gave guidance at the end of last year, at the Investor Day, we talked about Q1 would probably be about breakeven for free cash flow. So we focus very hard on collections, and just some of them came in a little bit earlier. So it's not an indicator of increased collections for the year. It's just some of the Q2 collections came in, in Q1.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJason Celino: I wanted to ask about the sales initiatives and hiring in APM? I know that's kind of a focus this year and just wanted to get your color on kind of how that's going this early on?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. No, look, we -- normally, we start the recruiting efforts for our new fiscal year, ahead of the fiscal year so that we can hit the ground running in the new fiscal year. We haven't had any issues. We have the staff in that we were hoping to have at this point as far -- according to our plan. And we continue\nJason Celino: Okay. And then kind of one question on for Karl on annual spend. The sequential decrease in Q1. Growth-wise, still up sequentially on a dollar basis. But is this kind of typical seasonality we should expect?\nKarl Johnsen: Yes. Yes. So again, Q1 is usually one of our lower one. In FY '19, we had a little bit of low performance in Q4. So some of that -- those Q1 deals may have been pulled into Q4, just as sort of the end of year processing cadence. But yes, Q1, we usually have the same seasonality to our annual spend. So you can look back and use that as a good guide for the last couple of years as to how you should see it coming in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair.\nDavid Griffin: This is David on for Matt. Real quick, I was wondering if you guys had any update on partnerships with some of your partners, such as Aon or Hexagon in terms of any new customer wins or increased spending activity there?\nAntonio Pietri: Okay. Well, I mean, up it's still early days with Hexagon because the fact is that the Hexagon partnership is more of a technology partnership, and we're working on creating a seamless data workflow, automated data workflow between our solutions to create basically a comprehensive asset design life cycle. So we've already been working with Hexagon and we've held workshops around the world with customers, where these customers are helping us define the work processes and the data workflows that they're interested in to see between AspenTech and Hexagon. So we've made a lot of progress in these 4 months since we announced the partnership. And the first release of that integration will be in the market soon.  We continue to make progress on other fronts as well. We were establishing partnerships with consulting companies and other systems integrators that are interested in taking solutions such as the APM solution and more specifically Mtell. And also the GDOT product around multi-dynamic optimization that sits on top of our multiple controllers. So we're encouraged by the interest that the company -- that we are seeing from potential partners as a result of the strategy and the direction of the company that was put in place in the last, really, 3, 4 years. So we're encouraged by all that, but early days.  The Emerson partnership continue to be a positive one. There are some things that we're working on fine-tuning as part of the partnership. I know now that Emerson has seen success in the market. They are interested in another level of integration of our solutions in their offerings, and we are discussing -- in discussions in that regard. So...\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel from Benchmark.\nMark Schappel: Most of my questions have been answered. I do have one though for you, Antonio. You touched on this in the press release and also at the Analyst Day with respect to AI and putting AI or developing AI in your different solutions. I was wondering if you could just give us a couple of real-world examples of how customers, at least in the early days are using AI or how they're incorporating AI into their processes.\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I mean look, so in a way, a lot of customers are our forming groups and hiring data scientists and some of the bigger companies, oil and chemical companies are even building teams that are focused on this. We believe that our position in the marketplace, and Rob Oliver from Baird referred to it as our incumbency in the marketplace, gives us a unique position because our proprietary technology our first principle is modeling. And when you leverage that and layer AI capabilities on top of it, creates a new level of insights and accuracy in our ability to model and drive optimization for these plants. We've had research going on in the company for 1.5 years. And I will not get into specifics of what we're doing because we consider this of a competitive nature, but we're very encouraged by already the pilots and the beta testing and even lighthouse deployment that we're going to have of these new capabilities.  And ultimately, I think what we're hoping to do is demonstrate to customers that the combination of our own historical capabilities with AI, including cognitive, deep learning, machine learning and other things integrated into those products, will create a new generation of capabilities that we hope will transform the industries once more.  So we are -- there's a lot of work going in this area. We consider it of a competitive nature. And at some point in the future, you'll start hearing more specifics from us. But the customers, by the way, that are working with us on this because we have something we call an innovation cloud. We've set a record participation in those innovation clouds, at least customers have learned about what we're working on. A lot of these customers are moving from that innovation cloud into beta testing and lighthousing of these solutions. So we see a lot of excitement, and we're very encouraged by the feedback that we're getting. And I'm personally very encouraged by the creativity and innovation of the team as we form a team of data scientists, which we've blended together with our own chemical engineers and computer scientists to create what we believe will be the next-generation of capabilities for the industry.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Andrew DeGasperi from Berenberg Capital.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [indiscernible] on for Andrew actually. We just had one question about the sort of new aspenONE or V11 that's been out since March. How have you seen the adoption with that in terms of converting users who generally use older versions of Aspen. Have you seen a higher adoption now with the new capabilities in version 11, or are you seeing more of the same in terms of how penetrated you can get with those legacy users?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. No, look, certainly, the adoption cycles for new versions tend to be longer and simpler in what we do because these technologies are deployed in operating environments for the engineering suite, which is also used by ANSYS, gets -- tends to get -- people tend to operate to it faster. So we're seeing faster upgrades into Version 11 of the engineering suite. On MSC, the drive for adoption on the MSC side is our GDOT product, which has unique capability in the marketplace, and there's a lot of interest in that regard. And it's a product that we consider will be integral to our results in this fiscal year. So that's driving adoption of V11 for MSC. So now we're -- so we're satisfied with adoption that we're seeing on V11, but normally, the engineering suite gets adopted faster than the MSC suite.\nOperator: We have no further questions. At this time, I will now turn the call over back to CEO, Antonio Pietri, for his closing remarks.\nAntonio Pietri: All right. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining the call today and look forward to seeing you during NDRs or investor conferences. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Antonio Pietri",
            "content": "Thanks, Karl, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. AspenTech is off to a good start to the year. The demand trends seen in Q1 show continued strength across end markets, product suite and geographies supporting increasing pipeline volume for our MSC and APM businesses and the continued recovery of the pipeline of business for the engineering suite, all in line with the growth trends experienced in late fiscal 2018 and throughout fiscal 2019. We're benefiting from multiple growth drivers that we believe position us well to achieve our full year growth and profitability objectives.  I would like to begin my remarks by looking at our financial highlights for the quarter. For the first quarter, revenue was $134.1 million. GAAP EPS was $0.67, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.79. Annual spend was $548 million, up 1.3% in the quarter and 10% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $14.3 million, and we returned $50 million to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 382,000 shares.  As I stated before, from a macro perspective, we continue to see positive demand trends across the business. The need to invest in technology to support digitalization initiatives is one of the most significant long-term trends in capital-intensive industries. Customers increasingly recognize that to achieve their business and financial objectives and remain competitive over the long term, they need to deploy technology that provides powerful insights into how their assets operate, to enable greater asset uptime and operational efficiency.  A good example of this is the chemicals industry. As noted on our last earnings call, we are mindful of the indications that the global trade conflict is having an impact on global chemical demand. During the past couple of months, I met with executives of many of our chemicals customers who have knowledge that their business has become more challenging. However, their feedback is that they remain focused on investing in their digitalization initiatives, which they believe is critical for their businesses and their long-term competitiveness.  Our APM business had a good start to the year, with significant growth achieved across this suite. In particular, Aspen ProMV had its second consecutive record quarter. Trends remain favorable, with growing customer interest in the suite and rising levels of sales activity. It is becoming apparent that the value proposition of the APM suite is resonating with customers, and they recognize the substantial benefits it can deliver for their business. For example, Aspen Mtell has differentiated itself in two key ways: superior accuracy and effectiveness and faster time to value. Mtell's Racy is driven by the deep insights it provides from data about the anomalies it detects. While there are other solutions that can detect anomalies, their inability to provide a contextual understanding of what the data means, limits their value.  Mtell delivers faster time to value as it rapidly scaled from one asset to many assets in a plant size or globally across the enterprise. Mtell deployments are automated and do not require specialized data science skills or significant time to implement and support.  The net result is that Mtell has a demonstrated track record of detecting anomalies early and identifying potential issues that other solutions miss. Doing so with more precision, accuracy and ease of deployment and use than its competitors.  Looking at other primary markets. The E&C trends seen in fiscal 2019 continue to manifest themselves in the first quarter. These trends are supported by CapEx growth at a mid- single-digit rate and incremental LNG CapEx investments that are driving the backlog duration metric for the E&Cs we track above its long-term trend. We believe the recent positive trend with E&C customers will continue. And as we come to the end of the renewal cycle for our contracts with these customers, we expect to see further improvement in the growth rate of that business.  Our refining customers remain a stalwart in the adoption of asset optimization solutions in support of their continuous focus on operational excellence. As mentioned earlier, digitalization remains a top strategic priority for these customers and AspenTech is a key enabling technology partner for these initiatives.  A group of these customers is also reconfiguring or implementing new operating strategies in the refineries to benefit from new stringent sulfur content regulation on maritime transportation fuel under the IMO 2020 requirements that dramatically reduce sulphur dioxide content in bunker fuel. The reconfiguration of refineries or adoption of new operating strategies can be achieved through a combination of CapEx spend and the use of technologies like PIMS-AO, GDOT and others, which all benefit AspenTech. I would now like to share a few examples of contracts we closed in the quarter. First, a chemicals customer in Latin America and a long-term user of our engineering and manufacturing supply chain suite signed an agreement after a detailed evaluation to use and deploy the Aspen Fidelis, Mtell and ProMV products in our Asset Performance Management suite at one of their petrochemical sites. The customer is facing issues with the quality and reliability of their feedstock, which coupled with equipment reliability issues, has created a challenging operating environment. The customer was seeking solutions to understand process degradation and equipment reliability problems in order to achieve better efficiencies in the operation of the plant.  Second, a mining customer in Asia and a long-term user of our Manufacturing Execution System selected the Aspen Mtell solution upon completion of a detailed sole source evaluation and successful pilot and after considering offerings from at least two other suppliers as part of their digitalization transformation initiative.  The customer is looking to improve reliability by reducing unplanned downtime in their operations. A partner of AspenTech executed the pilot with the customer and is now focused on the implementation of that technology in the customers' copper manufacturing facility. Further rollout of the technology is expected to other metals manufacturing facilities and mining operations. This engagement model is a demonstration of the progress we are making to establish an ecosystem for the successful testing and implementation of Mtell.  Third, an integrated oil company in Canada and long-term user of our engineering and MSC suites selected Aspen Mtell after initially conducting an evaluation of multiple vendors and then narrowing the process to 3 finalists. The customer set up a group dedicated to evaluating technologies not currently used by the company that could deliver significant incremental value.  A business case was jointly developed for a refinery that identified over $10 million in annual benefits through lost profit opportunities and maintenance spend reduction. Also, a second upstream site was included in this study showing similar benefit potential.  The initial deployment will be to these 2 sites and will be performed by a partner of AspenTech. The successful deployment of Aspen Mtell is expected to lead to the industrialization of the product across all the company's assets.  Fourth, one of the largest tire manufacturers with plants around the world and user of our supply chain management product decided to evaluate new solutions in the marketplace as their business needs have evolved, requiring planned scheduling optimization. After the customer first conducted a failed pilot with a competitor's product, our team worked with the customer to show the enhanced functionality of our plant scheduling products, Aspen Plant Scheduling Enhanced Automation, or Aspen PSEA, and Aspen Plant Scheduling Enhanced Optimization, or Aspen PSEO, in the aspenONE version 11 software release. After proving out the new capabilities to the customer, they decided to move forward with our products, signing a new agreement that commits to the rollout of the Aspen PSEO product for their primary site and Aspen PSEA product for their secondary sites.  Fifth and final, a long-term European customer of AspenTech has committed to increasing the use of Aspentech's refinery planning and branding solution, PMSO and multi-brand optimization and MBO as part of its strategy to meet IMO 2020 specifications in maritime fuel production due to its strategic proximity to shipping lanes. This is in the context of a broader dealer transformation program to capture potential margin optimization opportunities, each of which represent millions of dollars in profitability.  Moving on to the products area. We recently announced the launch of Aspen Enterprise Insights, a visualization and workflow management solution that aggregates and analyzes data from across the enterprise to deliver insights and actionable information and drive better collaboration and decision making within organizations. This release incorporates the technology from the Sabisu acquisition last quarter and is an important example of the type of collaborative and data-driven applications we're focused on introducing to the market.  Based on initial feedback from customers, we anticipate a strong interest and the capabilities of this technology to help customers aggregate, analyze and visualize information across their enterprises. Early customer feedback on the acquired capabilities of Nuvo and Sabisu and our broader vision for AI and machine learning has been very positive. Customers recognize that deploying these technologies has the potential to lead to better understanding of how to drive higher levels of operational excellence across their assets.  We're working on integrating the Nuvo technology stack into the architecture of our future solutions to enable their enterprise deployment through cloud capabilities. And over time, also via edge computing capabilities. In addition, we will continue to sell the Nuvo technology stack as an OEM solution into their historical verticals, which all fall under the global economy industries of AspenTech.  We also continue to make incremental investments in our product portfolio and our sales capacity for APM to fully capitalize on our growth opportunities. The combination of our scalable business model and rigorous ROI-based investment methodology allows us to effectively manage the balance between spending for growth and continue to maintain our strong profitability levels.  We will continue to utilize our balance sheet and allocate capital to invest in our organic growth initiatives, pursue acquisitions and execute on our share repurchase program. To summarize, AspenTech head off to a good start in fiscal 2020, and we believe we're well positioned to achieve our full year growth and profitability outlook. We're executing well on our strategic growth initiative and believe we will continue generating an attractive combination of growth and profitability for the foreseeable future as customers continue to invest in digitalization, in our core market and GEIs. We're confident this will generate significant value for long-term shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Karl. Karl? Well, I mean, look we -- the specifics that we normally give around APM are at the half year mark of the fiscal year to account for whatever variability happens between quarters. But our pipeline continues to reflect an increasing number of multi-side or enterprise style deals. In Q1, we signed more new customers to the use of both Mtell, ProMV and Fidelis, and we were very happy with the acceleration of that business versus Q1 FY '19. That's what I will say about that. Yes. Well look, I think it's multiple times. It depends on the number of assets the customers have to further roll out the technology. In the case of the customers multiple sites, in the case of the customer in Canada it's not only refineries but upstream operations. In mining, we talked about a customer that was rolling the technology out already to 7 different mines. You have customers in chemicals that have multiple chemical plants. So the multiple is -- the potential for annual spend growth is multiple times what we get out of the initial land in deal. And that is now starting to get reflected on the APM pipeline, which is continuing to grow and is as large as it's ever been since we started this business almost 2.5 years ago now. Yes, Rob, I don't know if it's something wrong with your line, but we're getting a noise or typing or maybe it's -- yes... Well, and that's the point, DJ, that we really haven't seen any change in their -- in the cadence of business from these chemical customers. They're all certainly talking about the difficult macro environment and deterioration of some of their end -- some of their businesses, but across the board, there's a commitment to adoption of digital capabilities and driving operational excellence. So we're encouraged by what we're hearing, despite the macro environment that these chemical customers are seeing or experiencing. Well, I mean look at -- I think we said from the very beginning that we're trying to be ambitious with our pricing from the get-go. And certainly, there was -- we were testing the -- our pricing in the market. And as such, we've made adjustments more. Specifically, depending on the end market as you move away from the process industries, you tend to see less value creation because of profitability, lower profitability in other industries. And then the other adjustment that's happened is certainly there's competitors out in the market that perhaps don't necessarily follow value-based pricing, but nonetheless, we continue to experience good pricing. I believe at Investor Day, we talked about how every API transaction is increasing the total wallet spend or amount of spend by those customers with respect to our engineering and MSC business.  So look, we were satisfied with the value we're getting. We've done an enterprise deal, and we're very happy with that value. And I think going forward, the thing that we need to demonstrate more often is our ability to price enterprise deals at a multiple of what we're doing these initial deals, which I think will be the case. But no, I -- from day one, we always felt we were going to go to market with value-based pricing.  And the other thing is that we're proving that the value is significant because some of these customers are telling us that through the 1 or 2 saves that they achieved after they implement Mtell, they are recovering the cost of the investment. And that alone says, okay, there is an opportunity perhaps to do a little bit more. But at the same time, we think we're getting good value for what we're selling. Yes. Okay. Good. So Aspen Enterprise Insights formerly Sabisu. Look, so Aspen Enterprise Insights is a enterprise visualization and workflow management capability. So it has some analytics capabilities but very rudimentary. It's really about what Aspen Enterprise Insights allows is it's a -- very tactically pull information from any system in your enterprise, aggregate it, do analytics on it or message that information to then visualize it and do that as part of a workflow collaboration process that then supports decision making and actions. When we talk about our own analytics solutions. These are heavy analytics solutions that are very localized in a plant on assets. What then Aspen Enterprise Insights does, it allows you to elevate all that information and then make it available to anyone on the enterprise. So for example, customers could want to do benchmarking between different plants, they maybe want to do benchmarking between similar type of assets across different plants. Also maybe we have Mtell on a compressor on a plant and in multiple plants. So the customer can elevate that information, aggregate it and then put it on a dashboard so that you can compare the performance of that compressor across multiple plants and the alerts that Mtell might be generating. So it's about data aggregation, analysis and visualization within a collaborative workflow environment to allow for decision making and taking actions. Well, I mean, Jackson. So I'm going to try to recollect from memory the price of oil 12 months ago, but I believe we were more or less in the same range, sort of range bound between call it $50 and $80, maybe it was a little higher a year ago, somewhere in that $70 range. I don't think dramatically different from where we are today. And really, at this time last year, with those E&C customers were completing their budgets for calendar 2019, we are now at the end of calendar 2019 and their spend was given by that budget that was set now a year ago. Those customers are now working on their budgets for calendar 2020, and that will be the real determinant of then growth in the next calendar year or the second half of our FY '20. So far, so good as far as the same trend that we saw through our fiscal '19.  Now new budgets are going to come into place for these customers in January of next year. And I will start dictating then our -- their spend on the second half of our fiscal year. Hopefully, I answered your question. Yes. No, look, we -- normally, we start the recruiting efforts for our new fiscal year, ahead of the fiscal year so that we can hit the ground running in the new fiscal year. We haven't had any issues. We have the staff in that we were hoping to have at this point as far -- according to our plan. And we continue Okay. Well, I mean, up it's still early days with Hexagon because the fact is that the Hexagon partnership is more of a technology partnership, and we're working on creating a seamless data workflow, automated data workflow between our solutions to create basically a comprehensive asset design life cycle. So we've already been working with Hexagon and we've held workshops around the world with customers, where these customers are helping us define the work processes and the data workflows that they're interested in to see between AspenTech and Hexagon. So we've made a lot of progress in these 4 months since we announced the partnership. And the first release of that integration will be in the market soon.  We continue to make progress on other fronts as well. We were establishing partnerships with consulting companies and other systems integrators that are interested in taking solutions such as the APM solution and more specifically Mtell. And also the GDOT product around multi-dynamic optimization that sits on top of our multiple controllers. So we're encouraged by the interest that the company -- that we are seeing from potential partners as a result of the strategy and the direction of the company that was put in place in the last, really, 3, 4 years. So we're encouraged by all that, but early days.  The Emerson partnership continue to be a positive one. There are some things that we're working on fine-tuning as part of the partnership. I know now that Emerson has seen success in the market. They are interested in another level of integration of our solutions in their offerings, and we are discussing -- in discussions in that regard. So... Well, I mean look, so in a way, a lot of customers are our forming groups and hiring data scientists and some of the bigger companies, oil and chemical companies are even building teams that are focused on this. We believe that our position in the marketplace, and Rob Oliver from Baird referred to it as our incumbency in the marketplace, gives us a unique position because our proprietary technology our first principle is modeling. And when you leverage that and layer AI capabilities on top of it, creates a new level of insights and accuracy in our ability to model and drive optimization for these plants. We've had research going on in the company for 1.5 years. And I will not get into specifics of what we're doing because we consider this of a competitive nature, but we're very encouraged by already the pilots and the beta testing and even lighthouse deployment that we're going to have of these new capabilities.  And ultimately, I think what we're hoping to do is demonstrate to customers that the combination of our own historical capabilities with AI, including cognitive, deep learning, machine learning and other things integrated into those products, will create a new generation of capabilities that we hope will transform the industries once more.  So we are -- there's a lot of work going in this area. We consider it of a competitive nature. And at some point in the future, you'll start hearing more specifics from us. But the customers, by the way, that are working with us on this because we have something we call an innovation cloud. We've set a record participation in those innovation clouds, at least customers have learned about what we're working on. A lot of these customers are moving from that innovation cloud into beta testing and lighthousing of these solutions. So we see a lot of excitement, and we're very encouraged by the feedback that we're getting. And I'm personally very encouraged by the creativity and innovation of the team as we form a team of data scientists, which we've blended together with our own chemical engineers and computer scientists to create what we believe will be the next-generation of capabilities for the industry. Yes. No, look, certainly, the adoption cycles for new versions tend to be longer and simpler in what we do because these technologies are deployed in operating environments for the engineering suite, which is also used by ANSYS, gets -- tends to get -- people tend to operate to it faster. So we're seeing faster upgrades into Version 11 of the engineering suite. On MSC, the drive for adoption on the MSC side is our GDOT product, which has unique capability in the marketplace, and there's a lot of interest in that regard. And it's a product that we consider will be integral to our results in this fiscal year. So that's driving adoption of V11 for MSC. So now we're -- so we're satisfied with adoption that we're seeing on V11, but normally, the engineering suite gets adopted faster than the MSC suite. All right. Well, I want to thank everyone for joining the call today and look forward to seeing you during NDRs or investor conferences. Thank you."

            "name": "Karl Johnsen",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our first quarter fiscal 2020 results for the period ending September 30, 2019. I'm Karl Johnsen, CFO of AspenTech, and with me on the call today is Antonio Pietri, President and CEO. Before we begin, I will make the safe harbor statement that during the course of this call, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from such projections or statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's call and in our Form 10-Q for the first fiscal quarter of 2020, which is now on file with the SEC. Also, please note that the following information is related to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, October 30, 2019.  Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. The structure of today's call will be as follows. Antonio will discuss business highlights from the first quarter and I'll review our financial results and provide our guidance for fiscal year 2020. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio? Thanks, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. As a reminder, these results are being reported under Topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings, and more specifically, renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years, and this nonlinearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods.  In our view, annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business and annual free cash flow, the most important metric for assessing the overall value our business generates.  Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for our term license agreement at the end of each period with approximately $548 million at the end of the first quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 10% on a year-over-year basis and 1.3% sequentially.  Total bookings, which we define as the total value of customer term license contracts signed in the current period, less the value of term license contracts signed in the current period but where the initial licenses are not yet deemed delivered under Topic 606. Plus term license contracts signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period was $135 million, a 40.4% increase year-over-year. The year-over-year increase in bookings reflects a significant increase in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal as compared to the year-ago period. Total revenue was $134.1 million for the first quarter, a 17.4% increase from the prior year period. The year-over-year increase in revenue was a result of the increase in total bookings discussed above.  Turning to profitability, beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $71.6 million, which was up from $64 million in the year-ago period. Total expenses, including cost of revenue were $86.8 million, which was up from $77.2 million in the year-ago period, and $84.5 million last quarter. The increase in expenses is primarily related to the organic investments we're making in fiscal year 2020 as well as the impact of our recent Nuvo and Sabisu acquisitions.  Operating income was $47.3 million, and net income for the quarter was $46.3 million or $0.67 per share. Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition-related fees, we reported non-GAAP operating income of $57.9 million, representing a 43.2% non-GAAP operating margin compared to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $46.9 million and 41.1%, respectively, in the year-ago period. The margin performance reflects the positive impact of the incremental license revenue recognized during the quarter. Given the fluctuations in our revenue due to the timing of bookings, we believe focusing on annual free cash flow as a percentage of annual spend is the most appropriate way to assess the efficiency of our performance in a period. Non-GAAP net income was $54.6 million or $0.79 per share based on 69.3 million shares outstanding.  Turning to cash flow. We generated $15.3 million of cash from operations and $14.3 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capital software -- capitalized software, litigation and acquisition-related payments. Free cash flow is ahead of our expectations due to a better-than-expected collections within the quarter.  A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables within our press release, which is also available on our website. I would now like to close with guidance. Please note that we are reiterating our guidance for all metrics except for GAAP and non-GAAP EPS, which are increasing to reflect the impact of shares we repurchased in the first quarter. Recall that we only provide guidance on an annual basis and provide directional commentary on the timing of annual spend and bookings during the year. Full guidance for our income statement metrics can be found in our earnings press release.  With respect to annual spend growth, as Antonio mentioned, we continue to forecast 10% to 12% annual spend growth for fiscal 2020. Of that, 7% to 9% is expected to come from our engineering and MSC suites and approximately 3% from APM. Similar to fiscal 2019, we anticipate growth in annual spend will be weighted to the second half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect bookings to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million, which includes $317 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2020. From a linearity perspective, as mentioned at our Investor Day, we still anticipate 40% to 45% of fiscal year 2020 bookings to come in the first half of the year, with the remainder in the second half.  As a reminder, on the Topic 606, our license revenue recognition is tied to when we recognize bookings, as such, our license revenue linearity will generally track to the bookings linearity. From an expense perspective, we continue to expect total GAAP expenses of $369 million to $374 million and non-GAAP expenses of $303 million to $308 million. From a free cash flow perspective, we're expecting to generate $250 million to $260 million. Our fiscal 2020 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments of approximately $55 million to $60 million. Our 2020 free cash flow outlook reflects the impact of incremental investments we are making in the business. From a timing perspective, we anticipate free cash flow to follow a seasonal pattern similar to fiscal 2019.  In summary, we began fiscal 2020, benefiting from the same trends we have seen in recent quarters. We believe we are well positioned to continue delivering an attractive combination of growth and profitability that can generate sustained value for the shareholders over time.  With that, we'd like -- we would now like to begin the Q&A. Operator? Sure. So you broke up on the first part of that question. Could you do -- ask that again, Steve? Steven. Just for my clarification, what do you mean by RPO? Are you talking about the contract asset the unbilled? What are you trying to as the remaining -- I'm not following what you mean by the remaining performance obligation. Yes. So yes, it's kind of -- as we said, the bookings, we've got like 40%, 45% in the first half, the rest will come in a second. So you can figure out the math on what that will look like by the quarters. And as a little -- as I said before, there's some timing in that, which might move stuff between the quarters. But in general, I'd use that split between the two. Yes, leave them separate. I mean, the bookings came in about where we thought they would come in for the quarter. It was really just, as we gave guidance at the end of last year, at the Investor Day, we talked about Q1 would probably be about breakeven for free cash flow. So we focus very hard on collections, and just some of them came in a little bit earlier. So it's not an indicator of increased collections for the year. It's just some of the Q2 collections came in, in Q1. Yes. Yes. So again, Q1 is usually one of our lower one. In FY '19, we had a little bit of low performance in Q4. So some of that -- those Q1 deals may have been pulled into Q4, just as sort of the end of year processing cadence. But yes, Q1, we usually have the same seasonality to our annual spend. So you can look back and use that as a good guide for the last couple of years as to how you should see it coming in."

After the speaker's presentation there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, your CFO, Chantelle Breithaupt. Thank you. Please go ahead, madam.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 ending June 30, 2021. I'm Chantelle Breithaupt, CFO of AspenTech, and with me on the call is Antonio Pietri, President and CEO.

With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Great. Thanks, Chantelle. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. Before turning to the quarter, I would like to acknowledge that tomorrow is the 40th anniversary of AspenTech's founding. Some of the renal team from MIT at AspenTech to this day, and I would like to congratulate them and all of our employees on this milestone. I would also like to thank our customers and investors for their continued support over the years. Now turning to the fourth quarter. Overall, our performance was in line with our expectations. While the macro environment has recovered considerably since our last earnings call, the spending environment by our customers remains constrained. However, we continue to have exciting and strategic conversations with customers. There is a clear interest in expanding adoption of AspenTech solutions to meet the objectives of increasing operational efficiency and sustainability. These conversations gives us continued confidence that we will return to double-digit annual spend growth over time as the macro environment continues to improve and spending budgets normalize. Looking quickly at our financial results, starting with the fourth quarter. Revenue was $198 million. GAAP EPS was $1.39 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.53. Annual spend was $621 million, up 1.9% in the quarter and 4.8% year-over-year, and free cash flow was $103.7 million. For the full year, total revenue was $709.4 million, an increase of 18%. GAAP EPS was $4.67 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.20, and free cash flow was $277.5 million. Looking at our fourth quarter results in more detail. We had a seasonally stronger performance, as you would expect, so the spending environment remains consistent with recent quarters. There continue to be a great deal of spending restraint in our core markets from the impact the pandemic had on the operating environment of our customers. As we have seen throughout fiscal year 2021, overall demand activity remained healthy with pipeline growth across all areas of the business. Conversely, the more difficult dynamic around transaction approval processes that we discussed last quarter was still prevalent, but we did start to see signs of normalization as the quarter went on. Overall, Asia-Pacific, North America and our SMB business were strong in the fourth quarter from a new business standpoint. At a high level, the overall economic backdrop improved during the quarter as many markets began to reopen and end market demand for fuel and chemicals approach or exceeded pre-COVID levels. However, this was not uniform across the world as the very recent shutdowns in Australia, India, Singapore and Japan illustrate. A positive outlook for consistent and sustained recovery from the pandemic, coupled with overall improvement in economic conditions should translate into greater confidence and readiness to deploy larger CapEx and OpEx budgets, supporting faster growth for AspenTech. As a reminder, our customers are operating with budgets that were set late last year in a more challenging and uncertain environment. We're cautiously optimistic that budget for calendar year 2022 will reflect the improved conditions we see today. But as we all know, the evolution of the pandemic and COVID infections is highly fluid. From a vertical perspective, refining margins improved to pre-pandemic levels in the U.S. in the fourth quarter and moved higher in Europe but remains under pressure in other parts of the world still dealing with COVID waves. Overall, end market demand and therefore, utilization rates and refining margins have been trending in the right direction in recent months. Financial results for refining customers or the refining businesses of integrated oil companies in the most recent quarter have improved to varying degrees, reflecting the asymmetrical recovery and evolving end market environment for these customers. We were encouraged in the fourth quarter by the increase in the number and quality of conversations we're having with customers focused on more strategic discussions about their future investment priorities. We believe this is a positive sign for future demand for AspenTech. Chemical customers saw record demand in some sectors in their most recent quarter with strong margins supporting solid financial results overall. Spending trends by customers in this sector are not back to pre-COVID levels, but remain healthy and were modestly better than the third quarter. AspenTech solutions are very well aligned to the chemicals customers' need for greater operational efficiency and sustainability. We expect chemicals will continue to be a source of strength for us going forward. Looking at our E&C business, our performance was better than expected, even as the E&C industry continues through a process of adjustment as a result of the reduced CapEx spending by their customers. CapEx budgets remain tight and this has led to reductions in backlog and projects on which to utilize our solutions over the last 12 months. But we did see a slight pickup in project awards going into the quarter and expect a slight upward trend in project awards going forward. We do not anticipate an accelerated improvement in this part of the market will continue to believe there's a longer-term opportunity in this industry. Especially as these customers continue to shift their focus to operations and maintenance activities and sustainability-related CapEx. Finally, in APM, we saw some improvement during the quarter in our core markets, but the trend is largely the same as we saw throughout fiscal 2021, high and growing customer interest. In the GI market, we continue to see more concrete purchasing decisions around Aspen Mtell. As we have discussed previously, APM has been an area where core customers have deferred buying decisions to preserve capital, given lower asset utilization rates and less need for maintenance. We're confident this is a temporary phenomenon and that as the operating conditions required, customers will begin to budget for operations and maintenance spending that will support increased growth in the future. A good example of the opportunity in APM was a low 7-figure expansion transaction we signed with a global mining customer, an existing APM user, this customer continues to expand its deployment of APM to other sites around the world. Overall, this customer is now spending more than $3 million annually on APM, which we believe is great validation of the opportunity in this market. Some other notable wins from the fourth quarter include: first, a global chemical company based in Asia, signed an expanded renewal for Aspen Mtell that extended its initial 1-year license for 3 more years after signing an initial contract for 2 of its plants based on the ease of use and scalability of the solution. This customer will now be expanding its deployment to 4 sites due to Antel's AI capabilities that enhance the safety and sustainability of their operations. Second, a global chemical company based in Asia and one of AspenTech's first customers has embarked in a transition of its business from bulk to specialty chemical production. At the same time, this customer is also undertaking a digital transformation to leverage more technology in its operations. As part of the most recent renewal, the customer expanded its commitment to AspenTech with added usage of Aspen AI model builder for some of the nonlinear specialty chemicals processes, which are difficult to model using first principles. The customer is also increasing usage of Aspen DMC3 and will continue to deploy in Aspen Anto. All of this resulted in a renewal with material growth with plans for expansion of usage in these and other technology areas. And lastly, a North American integrated oil company and long-term customer of AspenTech decided to embark on a digital transformation of its petroleum supply chain from production to retail to capture the full potential of their value chain. More than 15 vendors were invited to a rigorous evaluation of their technology and capabilities. AspenTech was ultimately selected as a leading technology partner for the comprehensive program that is expected to generate incremental free cash flow in the hundreds of millions of dollars for this customer. I would now like to provide you with some additional details about our performance for the full year 2021, all of which are quoted on an annual spend basis. From a product perspective, the engineering business grew annual spend 3.3% for the year, generating 40% of our overall annual spend growth. This performance exceeded our expectations, supported by stronger performance than expected in the E&C vertical. Our manufacturing and supply chain, our MSC business delivered annual spend growth of 5.8%, representing 40% of our total annual spend growth. MSC was the area most heavily impacted by coverage-related disruptions and the related macro environment, as customers pulled back on their OpEx budgets due to the significant deterioration in their operating environment. This was the first time in many years, the MSC business did not grow more than 10%. Traditionally, MSC has not been a cyclical business, and we don't expect it to be in the future, but the historic COVID related downturn impacted our owner-operator customers in ways not experienced before. The Asset Performance Management or APM business generated total annual spend growth of 16.2% or 13% of our total annual spend growth for the year. contributing 0.6 points of annual spend growth. As we discussed throughout the year, APM's performance reflected an increase in no decisions by customers looking to defer investment decisions until they had more visibility into their business outlook. At the end of the year, our installed base of business was split 57% engineering, 39% MSC and 4% APM. Our three core verticals of energy, chemicals and engineering and construction contributed 46%, 24% and 24% of our growth in annual spend during the year, respectively. Global economy industries or GIs contributed 6% of our inaspend growth for the year and grew 4.7% in the year. We are in the early days of our investment in Pharmaceuticals. We grew our business 8.6% in the year. We expect this industry to be a more meaningful contributor to growth in this fiscal year and going forward. In addition to standing up an organization focused on this industry and increasing our R&D and marketing investments, we have been building our pharma sales channel in Europe and North America over the last 6 months with incremental investment planned in Asia this fiscal year. We believe pharmaceuticals represent an important opportunity for AspenTech as this industry drives the digitalization of their business operations and increases the use of technology in manufacturing and for their sustainability ambitions. We're also optimistic for the opportunity in the metals and mining industry, particularly with the APM suite. We grew our business in this industry, 12.6% in the year. There's an increasing number of APM customers in this industry, and they have expanded the use of our technology because preventive failure alerts create significant value. We will plan for increasing our investments as the opportunity evolves and our strategy is executed. At the end of fiscal year 2021, the energy vertical represented 41% of our business; chemicals, 28%; engineering and construction, 25% and GEIs, including pharma, 6%. For the full year, our attrition rate was 6.7%. This is above the high end of the 5% to 6% range that we provided at the beginning of the year and guidance even in our most recent earnings call. Most of the additional attrition was attributable to a divestiture of certain assets by a few customers. This impacts attrition since these assets rolled out those customers' contracts but it is offset by a corresponding increase in spend by the customer acquiring the assets. Despite the challenges this year, it is important to note that we generated gross growth or growth prior to attrition of 11.4% in fiscal 2021. This is a tremendous validation of how valuable our solutions are to customers. During the fourth quarter, we held our biannual Optimize Conference, our first virtual customer conference. This year's optimize was 5 times larger than our most recent in-person event with more than 5,400 participants, representing over 2,000 companies and 84 countries. This year's optimize was entitled the future starts with industrial AI and the recurring topic was how customers can generate new levels of operational excellence while simultaneously addressing their sustainability targets. This dual challenge broadly means meeting the increasing demand for resources and higher standards of living from a growing population while also addressing sustainability goals, reductions in emissions and reductions in plastic waste in the environment. Many of our existing customers share their progress on meeting the dual challenge using our products and solutions. One notable example was a customer in Japan, which is a producer of packaging materials derived from propylene and other resins. This customer implemented our supply chain management solution in their distribution network and we're able to achieve reductions in CO2 emissions of over 160,000 metric tons per year. Also, as part of its supply chain distribution, optimization and logistics, the customer collected some of the waste being produced as a result of the use of their products and returned over 43,000 metric tons per year to warehouses for recycling, all simply through the use of supply chain management capabilities. This customer received the 2020 Green Supply Chain award from the demand and supply executive publication in Japan. Taking this to a higher level, AspenTech has estimated that collectively among our customers, the use of our products and solutions generate $59 billion in profit per year through greater efficiencies and productivity. At the same time, we have calculated that among our European refinery customers alone, they have in total realized CO2 emission reductions of 2.3 million metric tons per year associated with $4.2 billion in efficiencies and productivity gains per year. Our unmatched domain expertise and growing data science capabilities have resulted in methodology and capabilities that we now refer to as hybrid products or hybrid modeling. This approach announced last year as part of Aspen 1 version 12, enhances first principle driven most with artificial intelligence capabilities. Our latest product introduction in May, Aspen 112.1 built on the hybrid model approach and represents the next step in fulfilling our vision of the self-optimizing plan. With our version 12.1 enhancements, we have extended industrial AI across our solutions to drive higher levels of profitability and sustainability in customers' operations. One of the most important futures to come out of this new release is first principles driven hybrid models embedded within our products, which brings AI directly into our simulators. With version 12.1, we now have a library of sustainability application examples that customers can leverage that range from carbon capture and sequestration modeling to optimizing the reduction of carbon emissions in production operations, also including biomass processing and hydrogen production modeling. Over the next few quarters and years, you will see us release more and more sustainability applications that will allow customers to not only model hydrogen production, both hydrogen transportation, distribution and capture. We will also introduce more capabilities around chemicals or advanced recycling and other processes that are of keen interest to customers. As I have said many times, there is no trade-off between safety, sustainability, reliability and profitability. It is all intertwined and it is what we have been doing for our customers throughout our 40 years of existence. As we look ahead to fiscal 2022, we are optimistic we will deliver increased growth while there continues to be heightened levels of uncertainty. We currently expect the year to be a tale of 2 halves. The first half, we expect to look broadly similar to what we have experienced in the second half of fiscal year 2021 due to current customer budgets. And the second half to start showing an acceleration of growth as we expect customers' budgets for calendar 2022 to increase given their improved business outlook. It is important to note that there is caution in our expectations. As we have seen repeatedly in the last 18 months, the impact of COVID-19 is highly unpredictable and has led to an asymmetric recovery. The global recovery has been uneven countries have come in and out of lockdown and the emergence of the Delta Varian has added more uncertainty. Our current expectation is for annual spend growth to be 5% to 7%. There are several assumptions underpinning our guidance. We expect the bulk of growth to come in the second half of the year. As mentioned earlier, our baseline assumption is that spending conditions improved in the second half of the fiscal year as customers set their calendar 2022 budgets in the context of greater certainty and a better operating and macro environment than they did last year, an environment with greater certainty due to COVID the delta variant could influence budgetary decisions and result in an outcome towards the low end of the range. From a suite perspective, we expect the engineering and MSC Suites will contribute 4 to 6 points of growth and APM is expected to contribute approximately 1 point of growth. And third, attrition is expected to be approximately 6% for the year. Specifically, we expect attrition in the first quarter to be elevated due to the concentration of renewals in more challenged verticals like engineering and construction and upstream, which will lead to higher-than-normal attrition. This will dampen annual spend growth in the first quarter and is factored into our outlook for the year. I would like to finish by reiterating our optimism for the business. In the midst of the most difficult environment we have seen in decades, we generated almost 5% annual spend growth and $277 million in free cash flow. While helping our customers solve the 2 primary long-term challenges facing their businesses, operating efficiency and sustainability. Fiscal year 2022 will represent the largest yearly increase in investment in 20 years in AspenTech demonstrating our belief on the opportunity available in our core markets and our conviction on the opportunity ahead of us in pharmaceuticals and in metals and mining. The investment plan accelerates our product road maps adds new talent to the company and continues to enhance our go-to-market capabilities as we position AspenTech for the next 3 to 5 years. We have demonstrated time and again the resiliency and cash flow generating capacity of this business through major downturns and our ability to generate double-digit annual spend growth during normal spending environments. We're confident the same will be through this time as budgets return to normal over time. We're excited for the future and the opportunities ahead for AspenTech. Now let me turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As a reminder, these results are being reported under Topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings, and more specifically, renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years and this nonlinearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods. In our view, annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business and annual free cash flow, the most important metric for assessing the overall value our business generates. Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for our term license agreements at the end of each period was $621 million at the end of the fourth quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 4.8% on a year-over-year basis and 1.9% sequentially. Total bookings, which we define as the total value of customer term license contracts signed in the current period, less the value of our term life contracts signed in the current period but where the initial licenses were not yet deemed delivered under Topic 606, plus hterm license contracts signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period was $225.6 million, a 4.5% decrease year-over-year. Total revenue was $198 million for the fourth quarter a 2% decrease from the prior year period. Turning to profitability, beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $77.8 million compared to $70.5 million in the year ago period. Total expenses, including cost of revenue, were $92.1 million, which was up from $85.6 million in the year ago period. Operating income was $105.9 million, and net income for the quarter was $95.4 million or $1.39 per share. Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition-related fees, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter of $118.4 million, representing a 59.8% non-GAAP operating margin compared to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $125.5 million and 62.2%, respectively, in the year ago period. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period-to-period due to the timing of customer renewals and therefore, license revenue recognized during the quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $105.3 million or $1.53 per share based on 68.6 million shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with approximately $380 million of cash and cash equivalents and $293 million outstanding under our credit facility. In the fourth quarter, we generated $103.2 million of cash from operations and $103.7 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and acquisition-related payments. In the full year 2021, we generated $276.1 million of cash from operations and $277.5 million of free cash flow. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables within our press release, which is also available on our website. From a capital allocation perspective, we resumed our share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter, buying 361,000 shares for $50 million. In addition, we recently announced a new share repurchase program for fiscal year 2022 to repurchase up to $300 million of stock. As part of the program, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement for $150 million that we expect to complete later this quarter. The remaining $150 million are expected to occur over the balance of the year. Utilizing our balance sheet, whether through share repurchases or M&A to generate shareholder value is an important part of our strategy. I would now like to close with guidance. Consistent with fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we will continue to provide guidance on an annual basis. With respect to annual spend growth, as Antonio mentioned, we are forecasting 5% to 7% annual spend growth. We expect bookings in the range of $766 million to $890 million, which includes $486 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2022. This includes approximately $58 million of contracts up for renewal in the first quarter. We expect revenue in the range of $702 million to $737 million. We expect license revenue in the range of $481 million to $515 million, and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $192 million and $30 million, respectively. From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $386 million to $391 million. Taken together, we expect GAAP operating income in the range of $316 million to $346 million for fiscal 2022. -- with GAAP net income of approximately $288 million to $314 million. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $4.27 to $4.65. From a non-GAAP perspective, we expect non-GAAP operating income of $361 million to $391 million and non-GAAP income per share in the range of $4.80 to $5.17. From a free cash flow perspective, we expect free cash flow of $275 million to $285 million. Our fiscal 2022 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments in the range of $60 million to $66 million. To summarize, we continue to produce growth and significant cash generation in a challenging environment. We are investing in our solutions to increase the value we deliver for our customers and ensure we are in the best position to accelerate growth as our customers' ability to spend with us improves. We have been through these cycles before and are confident we will return to double-digit annual spend growth over time. With that operator, let's begin the Q&A, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Robinson from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nDavid Robinson: The first question I had was about the kind of the budget improvements that you're expecting for the next upcoming fiscal year. Can you quantify kind of how much you expect the budgets to improve relative to 2021 in your customers' markets?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, let me -- let me frame it in the following manner. And of course, it will be up to customers to decide how much they're going to increase their budgets. But -- If you look at sort of the key metrics that we track for the performance of our customers, certainly, oil prices have been in a healthy range for the last few months. If you look at chemicals demand is back to pre-covid or above pre-covid levels if you look both at now at refining margins, they're back to pre-covid levels. Chemicals margins have exceeded pre-covid levels and in a way, are in some cases, sitting setting records. There's an expectation that CapEx investment will begin to grow, perhaps in the low single digits. But nonetheless, as well. So if you take all those metrics as a group, you think that we will have a better budget and spending environment next year. Now at the same time, look, the COVID pandemic and the Delta variant certainly introduce a question mark around where the outlook will be in the fall season. And that's something that may or may not have an impact on budget. But overall, we feel that our customers will be increasing their budgets for calendar 2022.\nDavid Robinson: And then one other question I had around the attrition. So you said you kind of came in within your expectations for the year. Was that kind of last customer that you referenced that disposed or disinvested in some assets? Was that kind of built into your original attrition expectations? I'm just trying to get a sense of kind of how that affected the overall rate for the rest of the year?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. So I just want to clarify, we came in somewhat above the range that we had given investors at the beginning of the year, 6.7% versus a range of $56 million -- What we saw in the last 12 months was an increase in M&A activity by customers, especially in the oil sector, where they were actually divesting assets, refining assets and that certainly led to greater attrition as a result of the divestiture -- This is not something that we had expected or planned for. But it's a result of the sort of reassessment of our oil customers of their businesses going forward. The sale of stand-alone refineries as they reposition their portfolios for the refining portfolios to be more integrated petrochemical sites. But to answer your question specifically, no, no, it was not something that we had expected.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nJackson Ader: And Ken, we've looked for a long time that when customers are under pressure, is that a lot of times, that will drive some efficiency purchases or efficiency demand. I'm just curious why you think that didn't materialize this year for your chemicals or refinery customers that were particularly under pressure.\nAntonio Pietri: Sorry, and your question is why it will or did it materialize?\nJackson Ader: Yes. Why didn't it materialize this past year in fiscal '20.\nAntonio Pietri: Okay. Yes. Well, look, we've now been engaged with customers, both virtually and in the last few months, I finally had some in-person meetings with customers, which was great. Look, as we said in the prepared remarks, the disruption that took place in the last 12 months was like nothing before, especially operating rate dropping into the low 60s for refineries and the impact that had in operational stability and their margins overall. When you're operating at those rates, your ability to create value from driving greater efficiencies in your operations is in there, okay? Because you are just not processing as much crude oil or or feedstock for your naphtha crackers to produce ethylene. So the need for technology to drive operational efficiencies is just is in there. anymore in such an environment. And frankly, in my entire career and I'm now getting to -- towards the end of it, I had not experienced a moment like this, where you have refineries operate at such low rates that their decision is whether to keep these assets operating at the edge of operational stability or shutting them down, which some of them had to do. So that incentive to drive more technology implementation, it just wasn't there equally with chemical companies. And our expectation going forward, though, is that as operating rates are now coming back to that 85%, 90% range. If you listen to Marathon Petroleum's earnings call, the CEO talked about their operating rates being at 94%. So that's all very healthy for them to start thinking about how to squeeze more efficiencies out of their operations, including chemicals. So including in the chemical sector. So I do think that we're now back to a range of operations where the incentive for technology adoption is back in play. And we'll see what happens going forward. So.\nJackson Ader: And then another kind of maybe strategic follow-up as well for you, Antonio. I mean is it fair to wonder whether the planned investments in pharma or the other GEI industries are warranted or worth it? I mean, if they're not necessarily growing that much faster, if at all, than the core on a much smaller bas I mean I guess I just would have expected that harm the pharma revenue would have grown a little bit faster than 8%. And so if it's not growing that much faster at the moment, do you think it's worth creating all this kind of sales and go-to-market investments around it?\nAntonio Pietri: Look, Jackson, that's a fair question from you. But look, let me say the following. Fiscal '21 certainly was a very difficult year from a someone of our end markets. But at the same time, there was a lot happening inside the company as we put our foot to the pedal on investments. While fiscal '22 will be the largest investment year in 20 years, fiscal '21 was the second largest -- We launched our AIoT business unit on October 1 of last year. We launched our Pharmaceuticals business unit on April 1 and -- We hired a metals and mining executive that is now formulating a strategy and we're beginning to execute put the business in place for that strategy. We've been growing our GI sales organization that is actually the 1 that's going to market. In metals and mining, we've been standing up our pharmaceutical sales organization as well. So in the context of -- from an operational standpoint, everything that we were working on was really to set up for faster growth in fiscal '22 and going forward. I'm not disappointed on our results in pharma or metals and mining. As a matter of fact, and glad we had it. But we do expect better results in fiscal '22 and going forward. And absolutely, those investments will be merited.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Obin: Can you hear me?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Hi.\nAndrew Obin: So Hey. I completely appreciate having to guide on oil and gas budgets as your customers have not even really started the planning process for calendar '22. Having said that, I think a couple of your competitors are definitely talking about the fact that having good visibility into '22 and even '23. And I think our channel checks indicate some of that as well. Can you just talk about this longer-term visibility and what kind of conversations you are having with your customers that are giving you confidence into '22 and '23? .\nAntonio Pietri: Okay. Well, I mean, look, we in AspenTech, it's been our philosophy to only guide one year at a time. So I will not talk about. Okay. Look, I think you're also implying that we were claiming not full visibility into our customers' budgets for '22, but some of our competitors are. I won't talk about our competitors, but what I can tell you is that where we see today, -- And what we have experienced in the first half of this calendar year, gives us a certain sense for what the second half of the calendar year, the first half of our fiscal year will be we believe the budget will be the same. These customers will maintain their sort of their fiscal discipline and continue to spend through the budgets that they said last call. And then come '22, look, we do think that budget will improve, and we're having good conversations with customers. But we'd rather be more cautious with our guidance at this point in the fiscal year and the calendar year. and then wait until what customers tell us they plan to do for calendar '22. So.\nAndrew Obin: No, no. What I meant to imply is that, I think it's easier for your competitors to make more vague statements about '22 without having to formally guide. I was not implying that they have more visibility. No, no, no. Another question Yes. And then just -- it's tough to guide in the middle of the year, that's all I'm saying. Another thing, I just want to understand, as we think about annual spend and where we are for fiscal '21 and where you're guiding for fiscal '22. As you think about longer-term plan, do you think that the curve has prominently shifted down? Or do you think there's going to be a catch-up down the line to sort of to get back to you on this track of, I think, 12% CAGR that you were talking about at your February Analyst Day.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, I mean, look, first of all, we're very optimistic about our end markets going forward. If anything, an expectation that CapEx investments in upstream will increase over the next 2, 3 to 5 years. Certainly, the refining industry will probably be going through sort of a slow readjustment in that integrated refining and chemical site will be more profitable going forward. And you'll see some refinery rationalization. At the same time, refining capacity in Asia and the Middle East will continue to grow. And on a net-net basis, refining capacity will continue to increase around the world. Now what happens in 15, 20 years from now, we can have that be paid in a separate call. But no, we're very optimistic about the next 5 to 10 years. Look, our job in Aspen Technology is to help our customers be the best towards of those resources in order to drive more sustainable businesses by reducing CO2 emissions and plastic waste in the environment. That's what we've always done in AspenTech. It wasn't how we position ourselves, but it is absolutely what our customers are now looking to do with this company. And therefore, we see a lot of positive going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc. Your line is now open.\nJason Celino: It sounds like the approval processes in your customers are still elongated, but it was interesting that you said that as the quarter kind of went on, it started to improve a little bit, but Help us understand the magnitude of that improvement, the end of the quarter versus maybe the beginning?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. I think it's a tale of 2 sides, Jason. One, the larger the deal, the certainly scrutiny is still there. Look, we work on on some 7-figure deals in the quarter. And certainly, there were still a lot of scrutiny on that level of spend. But as you get to smaller deals, we saw a lot less friction in getting those deals approved. So I think there's a greater degree of comfort on the environment. All these -- our oil and chemical companies have reported incredible cash flow generation in the last quarter. And I think that's also been leading to a loosening of some of the approval processes for smaller spend. larger spend, yes, is still there, the approval processes. So -- but I think that will continue to evolve over the next few months.\nJason Celino: And then when I look at the free cash flow guidance, it's basically flat year-over-year, and it's lower growth than the annual spend that we saw that you're forecasting. Maybe why is that?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. I'll let Chantelle step in here. Go ahead, Chantelle.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. I think that there are 2 things, and this is really have a prudent free cash flow guidance, I would say that the 2 things I would take into consideration are the investments that we're making where we can play the big -- the largest investment as Antonio referred to in 20 years into those diverse kind of industries and our core. And two, we have a position on cash taxes that we're still working through to see. So I'd say cash tax assumptions and the investments are the 2 main factors we're working through in that guide.\nJason Celino: And then maybe 1 quick follow-up on the big investments here. And how much is it headcount related versus other development or product type investment?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. I would say there's three main categories. We have talent, what you call it headcount, I'd call it talent investment. -- we have R&D investments. And then the third one would be our go-to-market, especially in some of the geographies that Antonio mentioned. So there's three main areas that we're focusing on.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Jason, I mean look, as we go into this new -- I mean, new industries, we've been in pharmaceuticals for a while, but certainly, we need to raise the visibility of AspenTech in pharmaceuticals, our visibility in pharma and our brand recognition. So some of those investments are onetime investments, but there's a lot of talent investment in there as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel from Benchmark. Your line is now open.\nMark Schappel: Antonio, last quarter, you called out a competitor that was giving away at software for free, I think, for like a 3-year period. Did you continue to see that type of intense pricing discount from competitors this quarter?\nAntonio Pietri: Look, now that I'm aware it wasn't raised or I heard of but something like that in our forecast call during the quarter. So maybe that competitor heard me talked about it in the last earnings call and was a little embarrassed and stopped the practice.\nMark Schappel: And then with respect to your ESG products, right, you expect to launch in the coming year or so. You did mention in detail the work you're doing in the of hydrogen production. I was wondering if you could give another example or to of some of the other ESG areas that you're developing?\nAntonio Pietri: Great, and thank you for that question, Mark, because the fact of the matter is that there's so much functionality in a product today that is ESG or sustainability-related that in a way, a lot of our customers are not familiar with it because they really never had a need for it. But now, of course, this is front and center. But look, carbon capture and sequestration modeling. Some of the early pilot sites for carbon capture and sequestration were modeled using our Aspen technology, biomass processing modeling. You can talk about, well, okay, hygiene in production, but also advanced chemicals or chemical recycling. So there's a lot in our products. Look, you can optimize a refinery from the standpoint of reducing the amount of CO2 emissions. And we have customers that are now inquiring about that functionality in a product that they've been using for 25 years. But at the same time, we are going to enhance the capabilities of our products around all of this. Just so you know, look, when I was in Asia, based in Asia, one of the biggest users of our Aspen custom modeling technology, which is a layer product and Aspen Plus where Japanese automobile makers because they were modeling -- they were modeling electrical batteries for some of their hybrid automobiles back in the mid-2000. So we've had pockets of usage of these capabilities, and now it's all at the forefront and probably will drive certainly some of our growth in over the next 5, 10 years and beyond for sure.\nOperator: There are no further questions. At this time, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Antonio Pietri.\nAntonio Pietri: All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. I look forward to hopefully have some in-person meetings here in the future. But nonetheless, thank you all.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chantelle Breithaupt",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 ending June 30, 2021. I'm Chantelle Breithaupt, CFO of AspenTech, and with me on the call is Antonio Pietri, President and CEO. Before we begin, I will make the safe harbor statement that during the course of this call, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from such projections or statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not not limited to, those discussed in today's call and contained in our most recently filed Form 10-Q. Also, please note that the following information relates to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, August 11, 2021. Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. The structure of today's call will be as follows: Antonio will discuss business highlights from the fourth quarter and then I will review our financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal year 2022. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio? Thank you, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.

Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition-related fees, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the fourth quarter of $118.4 million, representing a 59.8% non-GAAP operating margin compared to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $125.5 million and 62.2%, respectively, in the year ago period. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period-to-period due to the timing of customer renewals and therefore, license revenue recognized during the quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $105.3 million or $1.53 per share based on 68.6 million shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with approximately $380 million of cash and cash equivalents and $293 million outstanding under our credit facility. In the fourth quarter, we generated $103.2 million of cash from operations and $103.7 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and acquisition-related payments. In the full year 2021, we generated $276.1 million of cash from operations and $277.5 million of free cash flow. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables within our press release, which is also available on our website. From a capital allocation perspective, we resumed our share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter, buying 361,000 shares for $50 million. In addition, we recently announced a new share repurchase program for fiscal year 2022 to repurchase up to $300 million of stock. As part of the program, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement for $150 million that we expect to complete later this quarter. The remaining $150 million are expected to occur over the balance of the year. Utilizing our balance sheet, whether through share repurchases or M&A to generate shareholder value is an important part of our strategy. I would now like to close with guidance. Consistent with fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we will continue to provide guidance on an annual basis. With respect to annual spend growth, as Antonio mentioned, we are forecasting 5% to 7% annual spend growth. We expect bookings in the range of $766 million to $890 million, which includes $486 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2022. This includes approximately $58 million of contracts up for renewal in the first quarter. We expect revenue in the range of $702 million to $737 million. We expect license revenue in the range of $481 million to $515 million, and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $192 million and $30 million, respectively. From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $386 million to $391 million. Taken together, we expect GAAP operating income in the range of $316 million to $346 million for fiscal 2022. -- with GAAP net income of approximately $288 million to $314 million. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $4.27 to $4.65. From a non-GAAP perspective, we expect non-GAAP operating income of $361 million to $391 million and non-GAAP income per share in the range of $4.80 to $5.17. From a free cash flow perspective, we expect free cash flow of $275 million to $285 million. Our fiscal 2022 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments in the range of $60 million to $66 million. To summarize, we continue to produce growth and significant cash generation in a challenging environment. We are investing in our solutions to increase the value we deliver for our customers and ensure we are in the best position to accelerate growth as our customers' ability to spend with us improves. We have been through these cycles before and are confident we will return to double-digit annual spend growth over time. With that operator, let's begin the Q&A, please. Yes. So I just want to clarify, we came in somewhat above the range that we had given investors at the beginning of the year, 6.7% versus a range of $56 million -- What we saw in the last 12 months was an increase in M&A activity by customers, especially in the oil sector, where they were actually divesting assets, refining assets and that certainly led to greater attrition as a result of the divestiture -- This is not something that we had expected or planned for. But it's a result of the sort of reassessment of our oil customers of their businesses going forward. The sale of stand-alone refineries as they reposition their portfolios for the refining portfolios to be more integrated petrochemical sites. But to answer your question specifically, no, no, it was not something that we had expected. Yes. I think that there are 2 things, and this is really have a prudent free cash flow guidance, I would say that the 2 things I would take into consideration are the investments that we're making where we can play the big -- the largest investment as Antonio referred to in 20 years into those diverse kind of industries and our core. And two, we have a position on cash taxes that we're still working through to see. So I'd say cash tax assumptions and the investments are the 2 main factors we're working through in that guide. Yes. I would say there's three main categories. We have talent, what you call it headcount, I'd call it talent investment. -- we have R&D investments. And then the third one would be our go-to-market, especially in some of the geographies that Antonio mentioned. So there's three main areas that we're focusing on."

            "name": "Antonio Pietri",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Chantelle. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. Before turning to the quarter, I would like to acknowledge that tomorrow is the 40th anniversary of AspenTech's founding. Some of the renal team from MIT at AspenTech to this day, and I would like to congratulate them and all of our employees on this milestone. I would also like to thank our customers and investors for their continued support over the years. Now turning to the fourth quarter. Overall, our performance was in line with our expectations. While the macro environment has recovered considerably since our last earnings call, the spending environment by our customers remains constrained. However, we continue to have exciting and strategic conversations with customers. There is a clear interest in expanding adoption of AspenTech solutions to meet the objectives of increasing operational efficiency and sustainability. These conversations gives us continued confidence that we will return to double-digit annual spend growth over time as the macro environment continues to improve and spending budgets normalize. Looking quickly at our financial results, starting with the fourth quarter. Revenue was $198 million. GAAP EPS was $1.39 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.53. Annual spend was $621 million, up 1.9% in the quarter and 4.8% year-over-year, and free cash flow was $103.7 million. For the full year, total revenue was $709.4 million, an increase of 18%. GAAP EPS was $4.67 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.20, and free cash flow was $277.5 million. Looking at our fourth quarter results in more detail. We had a seasonally stronger performance, as you would expect, so the spending environment remains consistent with recent quarters. There continue to be a great deal of spending restraint in our core markets from the impact the pandemic had on the operating environment of our customers. As we have seen throughout fiscal year 2021, overall demand activity remained healthy with pipeline growth across all areas of the business. Conversely, the more difficult dynamic around transaction approval processes that we discussed last quarter was still prevalent, but we did start to see signs of normalization as the quarter went on. Overall, Asia-Pacific, North America and our SMB business were strong in the fourth quarter from a new business standpoint. At a high level, the overall economic backdrop improved during the quarter as many markets began to reopen and end market demand for fuel and chemicals approach or exceeded pre-COVID levels. However, this was not uniform across the world as the very recent shutdowns in Australia, India, Singapore and Japan illustrate. A positive outlook for consistent and sustained recovery from the pandemic, coupled with overall improvement in economic conditions should translate into greater confidence and readiness to deploy larger CapEx and OpEx budgets, supporting faster growth for AspenTech. As a reminder, our customers are operating with budgets that were set late last year in a more challenging and uncertain environment. We're cautiously optimistic that budget for calendar year 2022 will reflect the improved conditions we see today. But as we all know, the evolution of the pandemic and COVID infections is highly fluid. From a vertical perspective, refining margins improved to pre-pandemic levels in the U.S. in the fourth quarter and moved higher in Europe but remains under pressure in other parts of the world still dealing with COVID waves. Overall, end market demand and therefore, utilization rates and refining margins have been trending in the right direction in recent months. Financial results for refining customers or the refining businesses of integrated oil companies in the most recent quarter have improved to varying degrees, reflecting the asymmetrical recovery and evolving end market environment for these customers. We were encouraged in the fourth quarter by the increase in the number and quality of conversations we're having with customers focused on more strategic discussions about their future investment priorities. We believe this is a positive sign for future demand for AspenTech. Chemical customers saw record demand in some sectors in their most recent quarter with strong margins supporting solid financial results overall. Spending trends by customers in this sector are not back to pre-COVID levels, but remain healthy and were modestly better than the third quarter. AspenTech solutions are very well aligned to the chemicals customers' need for greater operational efficiency and sustainability. We expect chemicals will continue to be a source of strength for us going forward. Looking at our E&C business, our performance was better than expected, even as the E&C industry continues through a process of adjustment as a result of the reduced CapEx spending by their customers. CapEx budgets remain tight and this has led to reductions in backlog and projects on which to utilize our solutions over the last 12 months. But we did see a slight pickup in project awards going into the quarter and expect a slight upward trend in project awards going forward. We do not anticipate an accelerated improvement in this part of the market will continue to believe there's a longer-term opportunity in this industry. Especially as these customers continue to shift their focus to operations and maintenance activities and sustainability-related CapEx. Finally, in APM, we saw some improvement during the quarter in our core markets, but the trend is largely the same as we saw throughout fiscal 2021, high and growing customer interest. In the GI market, we continue to see more concrete purchasing decisions around Aspen Mtell. As we have discussed previously, APM has been an area where core customers have deferred buying decisions to preserve capital, given lower asset utilization rates and less need for maintenance. We're confident this is a temporary phenomenon and that as the operating conditions required, customers will begin to budget for operations and maintenance spending that will support increased growth in the future. A good example of the opportunity in APM was a low 7-figure expansion transaction we signed with a global mining customer, an existing APM user, this customer continues to expand its deployment of APM to other sites around the world. Overall, this customer is now spending more than $3 million annually on APM, which we believe is great validation of the opportunity in this market. Some other notable wins from the fourth quarter include: first, a global chemical company based in Asia, signed an expanded renewal for Aspen Mtell that extended its initial 1-year license for 3 more years after signing an initial contract for 2 of its plants based on the ease of use and scalability of the solution. This customer will now be expanding its deployment to 4 sites due to Antel's AI capabilities that enhance the safety and sustainability of their operations. Second, a global chemical company based in Asia and one of AspenTech's first customers has embarked in a transition of its business from bulk to specialty chemical production. At the same time, this customer is also undertaking a digital transformation to leverage more technology in its operations. As part of the most recent renewal, the customer expanded its commitment to AspenTech with added usage of Aspen AI model builder for some of the nonlinear specialty chemicals processes, which are difficult to model using first principles. The customer is also increasing usage of Aspen DMC3 and will continue to deploy in Aspen Anto. All of this resulted in a renewal with material growth with plans for expansion of usage in these and other technology areas. And lastly, a North American integrated oil company and long-term customer of AspenTech decided to embark on a digital transformation of its petroleum supply chain from production to retail to capture the full potential of their value chain. More than 15 vendors were invited to a rigorous evaluation of their technology and capabilities. AspenTech was ultimately selected as a leading technology partner for the comprehensive program that is expected to generate incremental free cash flow in the hundreds of millions of dollars for this customer. I would now like to provide you with some additional details about our performance for the full year 2021, all of which are quoted on an annual spend basis. From a product perspective, the engineering business grew annual spend 3.3% for the year, generating 40% of our overall annual spend growth. This performance exceeded our expectations, supported by stronger performance than expected in the E&C vertical. Our manufacturing and supply chain, our MSC business delivered annual spend growth of 5.8%, representing 40% of our total annual spend growth. MSC was the area most heavily impacted by coverage-related disruptions and the related macro environment, as customers pulled back on their OpEx budgets due to the significant deterioration in their operating environment. This was the first time in many years, the MSC business did not grow more than 10%. Traditionally, MSC has not been a cyclical business, and we don't expect it to be in the future, but the historic COVID related downturn impacted our owner-operator customers in ways not experienced before. The Asset Performance Management or APM business generated total annual spend growth of 16.2% or 13% of our total annual spend growth for the year. contributing 0.6 points of annual spend growth. As we discussed throughout the year, APM's performance reflected an increase in no decisions by customers looking to defer investment decisions until they had more visibility into their business outlook. At the end of the year, our installed base of business was split 57% engineering, 39% MSC and 4% APM. Our three core verticals of energy, chemicals and engineering and construction contributed 46%, 24% and 24% of our growth in annual spend during the year, respectively. Global economy industries or GIs contributed 6% of our inaspend growth for the year and grew 4.7% in the year. We are in the early days of our investment in Pharmaceuticals. We grew our business 8.6% in the year. We expect this industry to be a more meaningful contributor to growth in this fiscal year and going forward. In addition to standing up an organization focused on this industry and increasing our R&D and marketing investments, we have been building our pharma sales channel in Europe and North America over the last 6 months with incremental investment planned in Asia this fiscal year. We believe pharmaceuticals represent an important opportunity for AspenTech as this industry drives the digitalization of their business operations and increases the use of technology in manufacturing and for their sustainability ambitions. We're also optimistic for the opportunity in the metals and mining industry, particularly with the APM suite. We grew our business in this industry, 12.6% in the year. There's an increasing number of APM customers in this industry, and they have expanded the use of our technology because preventive failure alerts create significant value. We will plan for increasing our investments as the opportunity evolves and our strategy is executed. At the end of fiscal year 2021, the energy vertical represented 41% of our business; chemicals, 28%; engineering and construction, 25% and GEIs, including pharma, 6%. For the full year, our attrition rate was 6.7%. This is above the high end of the 5% to 6% range that we provided at the beginning of the year and guidance even in our most recent earnings call. Most of the additional attrition was attributable to a divestiture of certain assets by a few customers. This impacts attrition since these assets rolled out those customers' contracts but it is offset by a corresponding increase in spend by the customer acquiring the assets. Despite the challenges this year, it is important to note that we generated gross growth or growth prior to attrition of 11.4% in fiscal 2021. This is a tremendous validation of how valuable our solutions are to customers. During the fourth quarter, we held our biannual Optimize Conference, our first virtual customer conference. This year's optimize was 5 times larger than our most recent in-person event with more than 5,400 participants, representing over 2,000 companies and 84 countries. This year's optimize was entitled the future starts with industrial AI and the recurring topic was how customers can generate new levels of operational excellence while simultaneously addressing their sustainability targets. This dual challenge broadly means meeting the increasing demand for resources and higher standards of living from a growing population while also addressing sustainability goals, reductions in emissions and reductions in plastic waste in the environment. Many of our existing customers share their progress on meeting the dual challenge using our products and solutions. One notable example was a customer in Japan, which is a producer of packaging materials derived from propylene and other resins. This customer implemented our supply chain management solution in their distribution network and we're able to achieve reductions in CO2 emissions of over 160,000 metric tons per year. Also, as part of its supply chain distribution, optimization and logistics, the customer collected some of the waste being produced as a result of the use of their products and returned over 43,000 metric tons per year to warehouses for recycling, all simply through the use of supply chain management capabilities. This customer received the 2020 Green Supply Chain award from the demand and supply executive publication in Japan. Taking this to a higher level, AspenTech has estimated that collectively among our customers, the use of our products and solutions generate $59 billion in profit per year through greater efficiencies and productivity. At the same time, we have calculated that among our European refinery customers alone, they have in total realized CO2 emission reductions of 2.3 million metric tons per year associated with $4.2 billion in efficiencies and productivity gains per year. Our unmatched domain expertise and growing data science capabilities have resulted in methodology and capabilities that we now refer to as hybrid products or hybrid modeling. This approach announced last year as part of Aspen 1 version 12, enhances first principle driven most with artificial intelligence capabilities. Our latest product introduction in May, Aspen 112.1 built on the hybrid model approach and represents the next step in fulfilling our vision of the self-optimizing plan. With our version 12.1 enhancements, we have extended industrial AI across our solutions to drive higher levels of profitability and sustainability in customers' operations. One of the most important futures to come out of this new release is first principles driven hybrid models embedded within our products, which brings AI directly into our simulators. With version 12.1, we now have a library of sustainability application examples that customers can leverage that range from carbon capture and sequestration modeling to optimizing the reduction of carbon emissions in production operations, also including biomass processing and hydrogen production modeling. Over the next few quarters and years, you will see us release more and more sustainability applications that will allow customers to not only model hydrogen production, both hydrogen transportation, distribution and capture. We will also introduce more capabilities around chemicals or advanced recycling and other processes that are of keen interest to customers. As I have said many times, there is no trade-off between safety, sustainability, reliability and profitability. It is all intertwined and it is what we have been doing for our customers throughout our 40 years of existence. As we look ahead to fiscal 2022, we are optimistic we will deliver increased growth while there continues to be heightened levels of uncertainty. We currently expect the year to be a tale of 2 halves. The first half, we expect to look broadly similar to what we have experienced in the second half of fiscal year 2021 due to current customer budgets. And the second half to start showing an acceleration of growth as we expect customers' budgets for calendar 2022 to increase given their improved business outlook. It is important to note that there is caution in our expectations. As we have seen repeatedly in the last 18 months, the impact of COVID-19 is highly unpredictable and has led to an asymmetric recovery. The global recovery has been uneven countries have come in and out of lockdown and the emergence of the Delta Varian has added more uncertainty. Our current expectation is for annual spend growth to be 5% to 7%. There are several assumptions underpinning our guidance. We expect the bulk of growth to come in the second half of the year. As mentioned earlier, our baseline assumption is that spending conditions improved in the second half of the fiscal year as customers set their calendar 2022 budgets in the context of greater certainty and a better operating and macro environment than they did last year, an environment with greater certainty due to COVID the delta variant could influence budgetary decisions and result in an outcome towards the low end of the range. From a suite perspective, we expect the engineering and MSC Suites will contribute 4 to 6 points of growth and APM is expected to contribute approximately 1 point of growth. And third, attrition is expected to be approximately 6% for the year. Specifically, we expect attrition in the first quarter to be elevated due to the concentration of renewals in more challenged verticals like engineering and construction and upstream, which will lead to higher-than-normal attrition. This will dampen annual spend growth in the first quarter and is factored into our outlook for the year. I would like to finish by reiterating our optimism for the business. In the midst of the most difficult environment we have seen in decades, we generated almost 5% annual spend growth and $277 million in free cash flow. While helping our customers solve the 2 primary long-term challenges facing their businesses, operating efficiency and sustainability. Fiscal year 2022 will represent the largest yearly increase in investment in 20 years in AspenTech demonstrating our belief on the opportunity available in our core markets and our conviction on the opportunity ahead of us in pharmaceuticals and in metals and mining. The investment plan accelerates our product road maps adds new talent to the company and continues to enhance our go-to-market capabilities as we position AspenTech for the next 3 to 5 years. We have demonstrated time and again the resiliency and cash flow generating capacity of this business through major downturns and our ability to generate double-digit annual spend growth during normal spending environments. We're confident the same will be through this time as budgets return to normal over time. We're excited for the future and the opportunities ahead for AspenTech. Now let me turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle? Well, let me -- let me frame it in the following manner. And of course, it will be up to customers to decide how much they're going to increase their budgets. But -- If you look at sort of the key metrics that we track for the performance of our customers, certainly, oil prices have been in a healthy range for the last few months. If you look at chemicals demand is back to pre-covid or above pre-covid levels if you look both at now at refining margins, they're back to pre-covid levels. Chemicals margins have exceeded pre-covid levels and in a way, are in some cases, sitting setting records. There's an expectation that CapEx investment will begin to grow, perhaps in the low single digits. But nonetheless, as well. So if you take all those metrics as a group, you think that we will have a better budget and spending environment next year. Now at the same time, look, the COVID pandemic and the Delta variant certainly introduce a question mark around where the outlook will be in the fall season. And that's something that may or may not have an impact on budget. But overall, we feel that our customers will be increasing their budgets for calendar 2022. Sorry, and your question is why it will or did it materialize? Okay. Yes. Well, look, we've now been engaged with customers, both virtually and in the last few months, I finally had some in-person meetings with customers, which was great. Look, as we said in the prepared remarks, the disruption that took place in the last 12 months was like nothing before, especially operating rate dropping into the low 60s for refineries and the impact that had in operational stability and their margins overall. When you're operating at those rates, your ability to create value from driving greater efficiencies in your operations is in there, okay? Because you are just not processing as much crude oil or or feedstock for your naphtha crackers to produce ethylene. So the need for technology to drive operational efficiencies is just is in there. anymore in such an environment. And frankly, in my entire career and I'm now getting to -- towards the end of it, I had not experienced a moment like this, where you have refineries operate at such low rates that their decision is whether to keep these assets operating at the edge of operational stability or shutting them down, which some of them had to do. So that incentive to drive more technology implementation, it just wasn't there equally with chemical companies. And our expectation going forward, though, is that as operating rates are now coming back to that 85%, 90% range. If you listen to Marathon Petroleum's earnings call, the CEO talked about their operating rates being at 94%. So that's all very healthy for them to start thinking about how to squeeze more efficiencies out of their operations, including chemicals. So including in the chemical sector. So I do think that we're now back to a range of operations where the incentive for technology adoption is back in play. And we'll see what happens going forward. So. Look, Jackson, that's a fair question from you. But look, let me say the following. Fiscal '21 certainly was a very difficult year from a someone of our end markets. But at the same time, there was a lot happening inside the company as we put our foot to the pedal on investments. While fiscal '22 will be the largest investment year in 20 years, fiscal '21 was the second largest -- We launched our AIoT business unit on October 1 of last year. We launched our Pharmaceuticals business unit on April 1 and -- We hired a metals and mining executive that is now formulating a strategy and we're beginning to execute put the business in place for that strategy. We've been growing our GI sales organization that is actually the 1 that's going to market. In metals and mining, we've been standing up our pharmaceutical sales organization as well. So in the context of -- from an operational standpoint, everything that we were working on was really to set up for faster growth in fiscal '22 and going forward. I'm not disappointed on our results in pharma or metals and mining. As a matter of fact, and glad we had it. But we do expect better results in fiscal '22 and going forward. And absolutely, those investments will be merited. Yes. Hi. Okay. Well, I mean, look, we in AspenTech, it's been our philosophy to only guide one year at a time. So I will not talk about. Okay. Look, I think you're also implying that we were claiming not full visibility into our customers' budgets for '22, but some of our competitors are. I won't talk about our competitors, but what I can tell you is that where we see today, -- And what we have experienced in the first half of this calendar year, gives us a certain sense for what the second half of the calendar year, the first half of our fiscal year will be we believe the budget will be the same. These customers will maintain their sort of their fiscal discipline and continue to spend through the budgets that they said last call. And then come '22, look, we do think that budget will improve, and we're having good conversations with customers. But we'd rather be more cautious with our guidance at this point in the fiscal year and the calendar year. and then wait until what customers tell us they plan to do for calendar '22. So. Yes. Well, I mean, look, first of all, we're very optimistic about our end markets going forward. If anything, an expectation that CapEx investments in upstream will increase over the next 2, 3 to 5 years. Certainly, the refining industry will probably be going through sort of a slow readjustment in that integrated refining and chemical site will be more profitable going forward. And you'll see some refinery rationalization. At the same time, refining capacity in Asia and the Middle East will continue to grow. And on a net-net basis, refining capacity will continue to increase around the world. Now what happens in 15, 20 years from now, we can have that be paid in a separate call. But no, we're very optimistic about the next 5 to 10 years. Look, our job in Aspen Technology is to help our customers be the best towards of those resources in order to drive more sustainable businesses by reducing CO2 emissions and plastic waste in the environment. That's what we've always done in AspenTech. It wasn't how we position ourselves, but it is absolutely what our customers are now looking to do with this company. And therefore, we see a lot of positive going forward. Yes. I think it's a tale of 2 sides, Jason. One, the larger the deal, the certainly scrutiny is still there. Look, we work on on some 7-figure deals in the quarter. And certainly, there were still a lot of scrutiny on that level of spend. But as you get to smaller deals, we saw a lot less friction in getting those deals approved. So I think there's a greater degree of comfort on the environment. All these -- our oil and chemical companies have reported incredible cash flow generation in the last quarter. And I think that's also been leading to a loosening of some of the approval processes for smaller spend. larger spend, yes, is still there, the approval processes. So -- but I think that will continue to evolve over the next few months. Yes. I'll let Chantelle step in here. Go ahead, Chantelle. Yes. Jason, I mean look, as we go into this new -- I mean, new industries, we've been in pharmaceuticals for a while, but certainly, we need to raise the visibility of AspenTech in pharmaceuticals, our visibility in pharma and our brand recognition. So some of those investments are onetime investments, but there's a lot of talent investment in there as well. Look, now that I'm aware it wasn't raised or I heard of but something like that in our forecast call during the quarter. So maybe that competitor heard me talked about it in the last earnings call and was a little embarrassed and stopped the practice. Great, and thank you for that question, Mark, because the fact of the matter is that there's so much functionality in a product today that is ESG or sustainability-related that in a way, a lot of our customers are not familiar with it because they really never had a need for it. But now, of course, this is front and center. But look, carbon capture and sequestration modeling. Some of the early pilot sites for carbon capture and sequestration were modeled using our Aspen technology, biomass processing modeling. You can talk about, well, okay, hygiene in production, but also advanced chemicals or chemical recycling. So there's a lot in our products. Look, you can optimize a refinery from the standpoint of reducing the amount of CO2 emissions. And we have customers that are now inquiring about that functionality in a product that they've been using for 25 years. But at the same time, we are going to enhance the capabilities of our products around all of this. Just so you know, look, when I was in Asia, based in Asia, one of the biggest users of our Aspen custom modeling technology, which is a layer product and Aspen Plus where Japanese automobile makers because they were modeling -- they were modeling electrical batteries for some of their hybrid automobiles back in the mid-2000. So we've had pockets of usage of these capabilities, and now it's all at the forefront and probably will drive certainly some of our growth in over the next 5, 10 years and beyond for sure. All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call. I look forward to hopefully have some in-person meetings here in the future. But nonetheless, thank you all."

With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks, Chantelle, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I want to start by welcoming Chantelle to AspenTech. Chantelle add significant experience to the senior management team. And I\u2019ve been impressed by her financial and operational acumen and energy she\u2019s brought to the company in the weeks since she joined us. Let\u2019s start by looking quickly at our financial results for the quarter. Revenue was $162.7 million. GAAP EPS was $0.91, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.05. Annual spend was $609.9 million up 1% in the quarter and 6% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $100 million. Overall, our third quarter performance was below our expectations. While we continue to have a meaningful pipeline of business, it remained a challenging environment to complete transactions. We had expected purchasing dynamics with customers to improve modestly in the third quarter. However, it was broadly consistent with what we experienced in the second quarter. Our assessment of growth in Q3 was predicated on the quality of conversations with customers and their commitment to a sequence of event that have historically indicated a high likelihood of closing these transactions. As a quarter closed, many of these transactions did not received final approval at the highest level of our customers organizations and approval step that is new, or has been historically a predictable final step. We believe there were several factors that played a role in the quarter. First, the unexpected polar vortex weather event in February in the United States, and specifically in Texas, and many of the key energy producing states force to shutdown of approximately one-third of U.S. refining capacity, as well as approximately 75% of ethylene capacity and 80% to 85% of polypropylene capacity, equally impacting other chemicals production capacity. Understandably, this emergency shifted customer attention to our shutdowns, repairs, and restart of these assets. With the last few plants finally return to operations only in the past few weeks. These weather events caused the refining and chemicals industry billions of dollars in revenue and incremental expenses has been reported by these companies. One refining company reported taking an accounting charge in the quarter of between $520 million and $535 million due to higher electricity and natural gas cost alone. We believe the economic impact from these storms placed additional pressure on budget and made it very difficult for customers to commit to new spend in addition. Second, continued COVID-related lockdowns around the world, particularly in Europe and India are delaying the economic recovery in this regions and creating a significant distress for the local refining industry, as higher oil prices and tepid fuel demand of depressed refining margins. This was also the case until recently in the United States. But as economic activity has accelerated here, margins have improved in the last few weeks. And third, these dynamics combined with calendar 2021 budgets that are reflective of the uncertain macro environment and mid $40 oil price. At the time, when they were said laid in calendar 2020 created a difficult spending environment. In light of our recent performance and the current market outlook, we\u2019re now taken are more cautious outlook on growth in fiscal 2021. It is important to know that, although we did not experience any significant losses in the third quarter, our updated outlook is based mostly in the decision making pattern by some customers. Although we continue to have significant customer engagements and demand generation activity at the top of our sales funnel, that support a pipeline of business that is broadly consistent with pre pandemic levels. We believe it is prudent to assume that the elevated level of late no decisions by customers in recent quarters could persist until at least the end of this fiscal year. As a result, we\u2019re adjusting the range for annual spend growth to 4% to 5.5%. Our initial guidance for the year laid out a wider than normal range of potential outcomes. And our updated outlook reflects first lower gross growth driven by curtailed spending and refining and chemicals, which has impacted our MSC business and lower growth contribution from APM consistent with the pattern experienced in the fiscal year, and second attrition that will come in at approximately 6%. I would like to spend a few minutes providing more color on what we\u2019re seeing in the market. As we discussed in depth at our Investor Day earlier this year, digitalization and sustainability are two of the most important investment priorities in the process and capital intensive industries. Customers recognize that AspenTech solutions are critically important to successfully executing in these areas, and meeting their goal of running assets safer, greener, longer, faster and more profitably. Our overall pipeline of opportunities has continued to grow each quarter since the pandemic began. And in particular, we\u2019re seeing growing engagement with customers for sustainability related activities. We\u2019re excited by the conversations we\u2019re having with customers, and they give us confidence in our long-term, double-digit annual spend growth prospects despite the short-term challenge we\u2019re facing. The macro environment has remained less predictable than originally anticipated, proving difficult for customers to commit to new spending in the near-term. We believe there are ways for our sales organization to adapt to this new environment. But this will likely only have a modest impact until macro conditions improve or normalize. The end market most impacted by macro conditions relative to our expectations is refining. Although customer engagement remains high, refining utilization rate, and margins remain below historical trends, even as they have shown improvement from last year\u2019s lows in the United States. Fuel demand continues to be well below pre pandemic levels and during the quarter lock downs \u2013 and during the quarter lockdowns persisted in certain key regions most notably Europe and India. The cumulative impact of the past year has weighed on operating budgets and refiners ability to make incremental investments in their operations. We believe this is a temporary dynamic that will reverse itself as macro conditions improve across the world. However, in the near-term, we would characterize business conditions with refiners as amongst the most challenging in the last 10 years to 15 years, and a notable difference from the last market cycle five years ago. Conversely, as we\u2019ve discussed on recent calls, chemical customers have shown good resiliency about spending soft-in, in the quarter, which could be a transitory issue reflecting the factors mentioned earlier in my remarks. These customers are focused on the longer term needs of their businesses and recognize the critical value AspenTech provides by enabling assets to operate in a more efficient and environmentally sustainable manner. Turning to the E&C market, our performance was largely as expected. The E&C industry continues to adjust to current CapEx spending, which is leading to higher attrition levels and lower new spend activity. As a reminder, these customers continue to use and deploy AspenTech solutions extensively across their operations, and changes in their spending levels are result of having fewer projects in backlog. We continue to have very close and active engagements with our E&C customers and understand the near-term challenges as well as exciting long-term opportunities in this market. In APM, we continue to see significant interest from customers as pilot activity remains at record levels. The combination of reduced operating rates in this asset and lower spending on maintenance has had a pronounced impact on closed rates in APM. We saw a continuation of the trend towards no decisions in many of our sales cycles. The increase in customer interest and successful pilot deployments have created a significant pipeline of various transactions that are available to be signed once market conditions improve. We have made important progress in improving now the value proposition for APM for many customers in our core industries and GEIs, which gives us confidence that APM can grow significantly faster over the long-term. We did close a number of transactions for APM in the mining and pulp and paper industries, including some minor transactions in our core industries, and most notably expanded the use of Aspen Mtell for an integrated oil company in Europe to one of their biofuel refineries. Finally, we have made good progress in building out our dedicated pharma unit, including the go-to-market teams. We believe the pharma market represents a significant growth opportunity for AspenTech and it\u2019s an area in which we plan to continue to invest. Following our highlights of a couple of transactions we closed in the quarter. First, a global chemical company headquartered in Europe, and long-term user of our engineering and MSC suites was offered by an AspenTech competitor the opportunity to replace our engineering suite by granting a free no cost license to their technology for three years after a careful evaluation by the customer of the capabilities of both solutions, the customer proceeded to renew the agreement for our engineering suite as well as growth span by expanding use to site in Asia and other recently acquire locations. Second, longer term European customer of AspenTech selected Aspen GDOT to expand use of the multi unit optimization technology to a second refinery. Aspen GDOT was selected after the customer concluded a competitive tender process originally kicked off in April 2020 and postponed multiple times due to the pandemic. The customer is looking to increase profitability at the second refinery by improving operational performance. Third and final, a new customer to AspenTech and meet your mining company in Australia signed a transaction to deploy Aspen Mtell at two mining sites in Australia after conducting a pilot for the technology. The pilot was kicked off during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2021. The value of Aspen Mtell\u2019s predictive capability was proven during the second quarter, and the transaction was signed this past quarter. Aspen Mtell was selected for being a commercially available software application, industrial equipment agnostic, fast to deploy and for providing a clear value proposition to reduce operational downtime. This success will lead to further rollout of Aspen Mtell to other mining sites in the future and creates opportunity for other AspenTech products with this company. As we look forward, we\u2019re focused on managing and executing against the things that are in our control to ensure were best positioned to benefit from an improved macro environment as quickly as possible. In particular, we continue to make excellent progress in building out and expanding our market leading product portfolio. The market is responding to our vision of the self optimizing plant and how we can leverage artificial intelligence across our solutions. Feedback on both aspenONE v12 and the AIoT Hub has been very positive. For example, a U.S. chemical manufacturer has been drawn to our v12 offering as a way to democratize AI access and utilization in their business. They have noted that our AI power model building workflow is a very user friendly way to build artificial intelligence models without having existing resources trained in advanced computer science. For them, if we put AI functionality directly into the hands of the manufacturing technical personnel, where it is needed most. We believe our recently introduced innovations combined with our existing technology and 40 years of domain expertise reflect a compelling product market fit that meets our customers strategic priorities have improved efficiency and reduced environmental impact. We have introduced a tremendous amount of innovation over the past year, which provides for a number of different opportunities for faster growth over time. Whether it is hybrid engineering models, Aspen GDOT, the AIoT Hub, Aspen Enterprise Insights for any of our other recent innovations, we have more ways to deliver value for customers than at any point in our history. We will continue to make significant investments in our product portfolio and go-to-market efforts to best position the company for the long-term. We have great confidence in our business and believe our ability to invest through all the stages of the economic cycle, it strengthens our market position and ability to deliver on our long term objectives. We\u2019re also hosting Bi-Annual OPTIMIZE Conference on May 18 through the 21, where we will continue to engage customers across all the innovation we have released and our long term historical products. This will be our first virtual customer conference and it is generating significant interest with 1000s of customers now registered. We have a strong lineup of sessions and speakers, with the technical sessions being oversubscribed from customer\u2019s interest to present how our solutions are being leveraged to create value and improve sustainability in their operations. We look forward to your participation as well. From a capital allocation perspective, we did not repurchase any shares in the first three quarters of fiscal year 2021. And we anticipate that it is unlikely that we will meet our previously stated intent of repurchasing $200 million of stock in fiscal year 2021. The lack of share repurchase activity in recent quarters was driven in large part by practical limitations, namely a lack of available open windows to reinstitute our buyback. We have a demonstrated track record of deploying capital to drive shareholder value through our prior business cycles. Our capital allocation framework and philosophy has remained the same. Invest organically in our business, in organically with acquisitions, and where business and market conditions allow us return excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases. Finally, I would like to welcome the two newest members of AspenTech\u2019s Board of Directors, Karen Golz and Jill Smith. Karen is a retired Ernst & Young partner who held a number of senior positions in her 40 year career with a company including as global Vice Chair of E&Y, Japan, and its professional practice and professional ethics and independence. We\u2019re excited to add Karen\u2019s expertise and experience to AspenTech\u2019s Board. Jill has more than 20 years of international business leadership in diverse industries, most recently serving as President and CEO of Allied Minds, an IP commercialization company for technology and Life Sciences. And an earlier in her career as CEO and President of Digital Globe, and a partner of Bain and Company. We\u2019re excited to add the diverse expertise and experience of Karen and Jill to AspenTech\u2019s Board. Before I turn the call over to Chantelle, I want to reiterate the inherent strength of our business and our continued confidence in its long term growth opportunities. Even as many of our customers face a challenging environment, we believe we will grow our business 4% to 5.5% in fiscal 2021 and generate industry leading margins. As the impact of the pandemic phase and economic conditions improve. We expect our business will begin to realize the customer demand as has built up over the past year. We\u2019re well positioned to benefit from our investment priorities that we believe will sustain double-digit annual spend growth for years to come. Now, let me turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you, Antonio, I appreciate those kind words. I am thrilled to be here at AspenTech to help lead the company through its next stage of growth. I am impressed by what I\u2019ve seen in my few weeks with the company and the incredible passion that we have to deliver value for customers. I look forward to getting to know many of you in the weeks and months ahead. I\u2019ll start today with a review of our financial results for the third quarter fiscal 2021. As a reminder, these results are being reported under topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings and more specifically, renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term licensed contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years, and this nonlinearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods. In our view, annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business and annual free cash flow. The most important metric for assessing the overall value our business generates. Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for our term license agreements at the end of each period was $609.9 million at the end of the third quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 6% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially. Total bookings which we define as the total value of customer term license contract signed in the current period, less the value of term license contract signed in the current period, but where the initial licenses were not yet being delivered under topic 606. Plus term license contract signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period was $175.6 million, a 39% increase year-over-year. The growth in bookings was heavily influenced by the timing of renewals, which represent the majority of our bookings in a given period. Total Revenue was $162.7 million for the third quarter a 25% increase from the prior year period. The year-over-year increase in revenue was the result of the increase in total bookings discussed above. Turning to profitability beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $77.8 million, compared to $70.1 million in the year ago period. Total expenses including cost of revenue were $93.8 million, which was up from $85.9 million in the year ago period. Operating income was $68.9 million, and net income for the quarter was $62.5 million or $0.91 per share. Turning to non-GAAP results, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition related fees. We reported non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter of $80.9 million, representing a 49.7% non-GAAP operating margin compared to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $53.9 million and 41.3% respectively in the year ago period. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period-to-period due the timing of customer renewals and therefore licensed revenue recognized during the quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $72 million or $1.05 per share based on $68.6 million shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with approximately $317 million of cash and cash equivalents and $300 million outstanding under our credit facility. In the third quarter, we generated $98.7 million of cash from operations and $100 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and acquisition related payments. We are pleased with our cash flow performance so far in fiscal 2021, which demonstrates the consistent profitability of our business and good performance by our collections team. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables within our press release which is also available on our website. I would now like to close with guidance. With respect to annual spend growth as Antonio mentioned, we are now forecasting 4% to 5.5% annual spend growth. We now expect bookings in the range of $771 million to $809 million, which includes $519 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2021. This includes approximately $146 million of contracts up for renewal in the fourth quarter. We now expect revenue in the range of $705 million to $729 million. We expect license revenue in the range of $492 million to $516 million and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $187 million and $26 million, respectively. The change in our bookings and revenue outlook reflect the impact of our more muted annual spend growth outlook. From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $355 million to $360 million. Taken together, we expect GAAP operating income at a range of $350 million to $369 million for fiscal 2021 with GAAP net income of approximately $306 million to $321 million. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $4.46 to $4.70. From a non-GAAP perspective, we expect non-GAAP operating income of $395 million to $415 million and non-GAAP income per share in the range of $4.98 to $5.22. From a free cash flow perspective, we continue to target free cash flow of $265 million to $275 million. Our fiscal 2021 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments in the range of $60 million to $70 million. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is typically our largest invoicing quarter with a significant number of our quarterly invoices due on June 30. To summarize, we are managing through some extraordinary dynamics in our core markets. The fact that we continue to grow and generate substantial free cash flow is a reflection of the value we deliver to customers and demonstrates the strength of our business model, we are confident that we will begin to see a meaningful improvement and growth rates as the market conditions normalize. With that operator, let\u2019s begin the Q&A please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Matt?\nMatt Pfau: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to start off, Antonio, just sort of want to understand that, change in time and guidance a bit better. You listed several reasons there. But it would seem that, really the new dynamic, that was probably an anticipated when you guided last time with these the cold weather events in Texas and in the south with COVID probably, being somewhat similar in terms of an impact from the second quarter, but either how do we sort of think about, what\u2019s the sort of bigger dynamic there that has shifted some of the close rates and customer sentiment?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, I mean, I\u2019d say that perhaps the dynamic that is new in this cycle that we certainly didn\u2019t see and did not have in the last cycle in 2016 and 2017 is with our refining customers. Clearly, since last April, the significant drop-in fuel demand has had an impact on their business. But I think more importantly, or equally important, as oil prices have increased later in the year in 2020 and into 2021 their margins really compressed in some cases experiencing negative margins. And I think that lead to a pullback in spending by these customers. Now in the United States, refining margins have actually improved quite a bit in the last few weeks as the economy has opened up and traveling has pick up so we see that but they remain depressed in Europe in parts of Asia and they\u2019ll probably continue until economic activity recover. So that\u2019s primarily the new dynamic and that\u2019s impacting the MSC business in particular, and also the engineering business or out of those customers. We believe that the softening of demand from our chemicals customer in Q3 had more to do in the U.S. with a weather event or they experienced in over Texas and other states. But I think it\u2019s a refining business, the new dynamic that we\u2019re seeing.\nMatt Pfau: Got it. And so I mean as a sort of a situation with the refiners specifically where we\u2019re just waiting for their businesses improve before demand returns, more robustly and close rates improved, or do we sort of need to wait to the calendar year flips over and budgets reset? How should we think about the drivers to get back to the better close rates there?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, look certainly we do think that, budgets that were said late last year were sort of discipline budget, if you will. At the same time, I do think the dynamics in Europe with continuation of lockdowns, and in India for example, we\u2019re going on right now. And then the weather event as those disappear, certainly the weather event only lasts, the duration of it was very short-term, but the impact was longer term only in the last few weeks. Some of those assets have returned to operation. But look, I think in the second half of this year, these customers on a global basis will probably have a better, better financial performance. How does that translate into spending in the second half of the year? Look, time will tell and we\u2019ll, of course, we will be engaged with those customers. But I, then again, later in the year, we\u2019ll be looking at new budgets with a completely different macro environment. So, we\u2019ll see what happens at that point.\nMatt Pfau: Great, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader from JP Morgan. You\u2019re now live.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Jackson\nJackson Ader: Thanks for taking my questions \u2013 hey, Antonio. First one on, between no decisions from some customers, and I think you mentioned a competitor, giving their software away for three years, competing hard on price. How are you guarding against the pressure, right, that salespeople will ultimately feel to maybe discount or take down the contract values here at the end of the fiscal year, just to try and get something across the finish line?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, look first of all, we have truly rigorous approval processes for deals. And I can tell you the one of the largest deals that we had in our Q2 quarter, we did not give the sales team, the approval that we\u2019re looking for to close the deal in Q2, that deal came over to Q3 and we finally managed to get to an agreement with the customer. It turned out that one normally is a customer that is very reliable, once we have an agreement with procurement to sign the deal. But the deal was sent to the CEO, which is never the case. But this time around was sent to the CEO for final approval. And the CEO held it along with other agreements that they were negotiating with other providers. So look, we monitor the health of our business. And of course, we have escalation levels for approvals internally. We will walk away from deals if we don\u2019t think is the right deal to be had with a customer. We\u2019re also not conducting a fire sale of our products here. But we do find look, you have a smaller pie of opportunities at the moment in the market are the weaker competitors are being very aggressive, just like they were in 2016 and 2017 absolutely the same behavior. And look, if anything, it strengthens our commitment to the value proposition from our products, when you have a customer that has an offer on the table to use a software of a competitor for three years at no charge, and they still decide to go with us then take and expand spend. So, I understand your point. But at the same time, we do see the pressure on pricing. But I like to think that, we run a business where we understand the value from our solutions. We will make accommodations if we believe it makes sense in the context of the macro. But in general, our customers have pre negotiated future token prices in their agreements that we have been negotiated over the last five years. And that is what\u2019s used for their purchases if they want to expand entitlement during this downturn.\nJackson Ader: Okay, great, that\u2019s helpful and then Chantelle maybe a clarifying question for you on the APM suite. How much has the APM contributed to annual customer spend growth so far in fiscal 2021? And then what are we expecting the APM contribution for the full year on customers? Thank you.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. I think Jackson, great to get to know you. I will defer to Antonio for that specific question, if that\u2019s okay, regarding suites.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, look. Thank you, Chantelle, and look Jackson, the APM suite, we continue to be very excited about it. The fact is that the use cases continue to expand into other industries. Now, it\u2019s been deployed at a biofuels refinery as well. But the contribution was not what, we expected in the quarter again, as the lower guidance also means lower contribution from APM. And we believe that now APM will probably come below the one point of contribution. Now, we have a wide range of outcomes for APM in Q4. And, if we get a surprise on the upside, there could be a lot of strength in APM, but we\u2019re not going to rely on that. And the guidance \u2013 overall guidance we\u2019ve given for the business also reflects lower end of our guidance for APM or expectations around APM.\nJackson Ader: Okay. All right. Thanks for the clarification.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, no problem. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rob Oliver from Baird. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Rob.\nRob Oliver: Great. Good evening, hi Antonio, hi, Chantelle, welcome to you as well. I\u2019ve two questions, one for you, Antonio, to start. Just I appreciate some of the, color on \u2013 at the margin, sort of what changed relative to your forecast? And I know you\u2019ve talked a little bit about end markets and just, obviously touched on APM their responses to Jackson\u2019s question, which I think is on everyone\u2019s mind, I wanted to ask about other particular products. Are you seeing particular products or products suites? Where you\u2019re seeing the most pushback? And does that concern you on in any particular renewals? And how does that sort of match up with what you\u2019ve seen in previous down cycles? Is this unique? Or does it look different? I just curious for any product related color? And then I had that quick follow-up.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, no, look I mean, actually, a lot of the dynamics that we\u2019re seeing in the cycle we saw five years ago. If anything, our footprint in the market has strengthened across the board, our engineering suite, at the moment, we believe will actually probably be a little bit ahead of our growth projections for the year. We do expect our MSC suite now to be a double-digit grower this year. The impact from refining is much more pronounced on the MSC suite. And then our APM suite, we\u2019ve communicated what we\u2019re saying with that suite. So, but look, it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re losing on APM it\u2019s not decisions. MSC is just a temporary low in spending on refining. And also softening in chemicals, which to me, it says that we had some dynamics in Q3, that perhaps were very specific to chemicals to the macro environment for chemicals. And then the engineering suite is doing a little \u2013 is ahead of our expectations a little bit. So, but now look, we\u2019re doing well from a competitive standpoint.\nRob Oliver: Good. Okay. Thanks, Antonio. Appreciate that. And then Chantelle, one for you on, just on attrition, and I know this was before you had joined, but last quarter, the thought was that, attrition would be lower in the back half of the year. Now, you guys I think we\u2019re talking about 6%. So, I just wanted to kind of focus on that a little bit and get your sense for what that is reflective of around particular renewals and how you guys feel is that or is that a range or is that fix just for the final quarter here for you guys for the year? Thank you.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes, no. Hi. Nice to meet Rob, Thank you. I think that\u2019s a \u2013 we are still within the range that we have some guiding. What I would say, to be fair is what we see as bumping up the higher point of that range as we get into Q4 Rob, to your question. So, still the range but probably more towards the higher part of that range as we get the pressures Antonio mentioned during Q4. So hopefully that answers your question in regard to the ranges maintaining and we see pressure to get to the higher point in that range, but not moving above that range at this time.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. I mean, Rob, and Rob, what I would add to Chantelle\u2019s answer. For the first time, we did see a couple of important customers and the engineering side in owner operators, and lead their renewals, expired and then renew them into this quarter. And toward there was a sign of a little bit of disorganization in their own organizations. They\u2019ve renewed by the way we count for attrition is attrition, if it doesn\u2019t get renew, and if it comes back, it\u2019s growth. So, we expect those yields to renew so or to get sign as new business. So but look, there\u2019s a lot of dynamics in the marketplace at the moment and around the world. And in some cases, we\u2019ve seen a little bit of disorganization in our customers, businesses as well.\nRob Oliver: Okay, thank you guys very much.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, no problem.\nRob Oliver: Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Moving on your next question comes from Gal Munda from Berenberg. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Gal?\nGal Munda: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I\u2019ll be quick. Appreciate the time. The first one just Antonio, if I\u2019m thinking just expanding a little bit from the last thing you said, when you think about this slip bills effectively that you know we\u2019re in that didn\u2019t get signed? How much of that related to just the pure cadence of renewals bookings that you had in the quarter? And how \u2013 like what proportion of them were kind of new activity expansions, potentially stuff that you thought might add to the current bookings that you had up on top of renewals?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. So Gal, I guess just to clarify that, I don\u2019t know if your questions are specific to maybe an over performance of the book inside versus expectations. But \u2013 look yes, so no, we look at we\u2019re renewing the core of what\u2019s available to us. The fact is that I\u2019m not aware necessarily of any material renewal that we accelerated into the quarter, I think that over performance that you\u2019re seeing has to do with the way we account for bookings, super seats and other stuff that where there are some parts of bookings are get recognized in the quarter from past quarter. So, I mean maybe Chantelle can add more color to that.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes, I think that \u2013 and nice to meet you Gal. I think that if I understand your question correctly. Your question was, if we are seeing more slips through the quarter during this environment, if I understand your question correctly, is that correct? Yes.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, basically on a, let\u2019s say you\u2019re on a five year deal, your deal\u2019s off renewal, like, did you have instances with renew just the normal renewal cadence of the bill would have kind of been disrupted and slipped into the quarter were those all kind of new deals that didn\u2019t get closed, because they didn\u2019t get approved? Were there any issues with the renewal deals that were supposed to be just as automatically or programmatically kind of renewed, but those got pushed out? So those probably carry lower risk and into subsequent quarters.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes, I don\u2019t think that, I think Antonio said there could be one or two during this time period that that slipped or became a new deal because of the timing on their sides. There are if you think about what some of our customers are going through right now, just the organization and the capabilities to put that all together on time for the renewal. I wouldn\u2019t say that there\u2019s anything indicating there\u2019s a trend for that to happen. And therefore, the new deals were likely more than new deals, but not slipped renewal deals for the majority. I don\u2019t see an increased trend in that, if that\u2019s the question.\nGal Munda: That makes sense. Awesome. And then my second question is, when we kind of look at \u2013 maybe Antonio for you, when you kind of look at the target that you\u2019ve talked about back in the middle of February. And you were in a bit kind of trajectory to get closer to how far away you think you are today to be able to deliver that kind of low teens growth on the annual spend is that kind of a 2020 without guiding but, is there like anytime which you see the environment improving, kind of in the near-term, or do you believe that the ends market has to improve a little bit better, as well to help you get there?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, look, Gal, like I said, in my prepared remarks, we still have a lot of conviction about the ability to deliver double-digit growth in the longer term. The trajectory to get there we\u2019ll give you an update on what we think we\u2019re going to be able to do in fiscal 2022 later in the year when we do our earnings call for fiscal 2021. But, look in general, say, the engagement with our customers only continues to strengthen. The conversations around sustainability, are becoming more and more frequent, how our customers are viewing us as a strategic supplier of capabilities to help them navigate this environment and their businesses and transform their businesses for the future continues to strengthen. So, I think overall, and I\u2019ve said it before, I\u2019ve never been as excited about the future of this company as I am today. In a way, we misread the environment that our customers were facing, especially refiners. I do think that in Q3, there were very specific events that played a role in our performance. But that doesn\u2019t change our conviction, about our ability to drive double-digit growth in the future and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working here to do. Including pulling towards investments that we put to work this fiscal year, and reaping the benefits of those investments over the next two to three years, three to five years. That\u2019s what we\u2019re here playing for.\nGal Munda: Right. That\u2019s exactly what I was thinking in terms of these \u2013 all the reasons for Q3 kind of underperformance since you have seen one of the impacts. So, if you look kind of outside of that, I didn\u2019t see any lasting changes that would make that trajectory over the midterm any difference? So, I just wanted to confirm that. I guess that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Not at all. Not at all. And I would just add that we continue to see even greater interest from third parties, potential partners, to work with us in going to market to these customers, because they understand the role that we play in this marketplace, in our core industries. And that\u2019s also to us an indication of how we\u2019re being pursued in the market by customers and third parties. So, I think you\u2019re taking the right take away from this.\nGal Munda: Thank you, Antonio. Thank you, Chantelle.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Blake Gendron from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nBlake Gendron: Yes, thanks for the time this evening, guys. So, I understand the one-off impacts in the quarter. And really, there\u2019s nothing you can do about competition outside of just bolstering the value proposition. And I definitely subscribe obviously to the MSC tailwinds and digital transformation overtime, but if we were to \u2013 maybe frame the conversation more so for engineering. Oil and gas prices are up, but there is a notion that the entire value chain is just going to be more disciplined from a CapEx perspective moving forward, this would be somewhat of a big structural change versus what we\u2019ve seen in past cycles. Has this factored into your outlook for engineering suite growth moving forward? And have you seen any impact to the EPC customer base, in terms of E&C companies maybe even going away or cutting engineering heads? Things are a little bit more drastic to deal with the structurally lower outlook for specifically CapEx in oil and gas?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. So, let me say the following. Certainly there\u2019s a few engineering companies that have reduced headcount. But nothing at all, like what we saw five years ago, I think engineering companies have been very disciplined about hiring. And they\u2019ve been managing their backlogs in a way that allows them to sustain their businesses, even through this downturn. So, I would say that. The other point, the beginning of your question, around sort of reduce CapEx environment. Look, actually, I think in a way that that provides a counter driver for more focused in technology. When you engage owner operators, and refining and chemical, they all recognize that they are in a lower CapEx environment for a number of years here. And as such, they need to focus on their existing assets, and improve their performance, improve on the reliability of these assets, in general, continue to drive greater operational excellence. And every customer that I meet with at the executive level, the first thing they show us is their list of 40 or 50 or 60 initiatives as part of an operational excellence program that they\u2019re focusing on to drive more value out of their existing assets. And those range from certainly digital capabilities in their offices and personnel to reliability assets, maintenance of those, there\u2019s probably a list of 10 or 15 that in a way belong to AspenTech. And there\u2019s a lot of actually excitement in our customer base about the next two to three, three to five years, I find, what I find and actually, I told my board this last week, there\u2019s a tremendous dichotomy between what you hear in the news, in general about what\u2019s going to happen to these industries. And then what you hear from customers, about what they view is our outlook for their businesses in chemicals and refining over the next two to three years. Certainly, there\u2019s parts of the world where, there\u2019s going to be some challenges, especially in refining. But look, I think, I think greater economic activity coming out of the pandemic we\u2019ll rise all boats. And these companies provide the energy, the chemicals, and plastics that improve standards of living and drive economic activity. So, time will tell what happens here. But, we\u2019re also very excited about the future so.\nBlake Gendron: That\u2019s helpful insight. So it sounds like any incremental frictions is a real opportunity for both MSC and obviously APM in that regard. I want one to switch focus to M&A. I guess, just more comments on the fact that you didn\u2019t follow through with the buyback. So, you\u2019re building cash here a little bit. Diversification is very important and pharma is one area of focus for you as metals and mining. Is it possible that you\u2019re maybe gearing up for more than just tuck-in M&A to make a more concerted shift into either one of those verticals?\nAntonio Pietri: Look, we\u2019ll never discuss potential M&A. But what I\u2019ll tell you is, we\u2019ve certainly put our foot to the pedal on organic investments in fiscal 2021. You\u2019ll see some of that, coming out of our Q4 quarter into fiscal 2022. Because we believe that accelerated investments over the last six months to nine months, will allow us to increase our lead on the competition as we come out of all this. So, we\u2019ve been making investments, as we\u2019ve been communicating to all of you over the last 12 months in the different areas that we\u2019ve talked about. Certainly, inorganic M&A is always part of our picture. We\u2019ve always said that we\u2019re interested in doing bigger acquisitions, especially into these new industries that we talk about. But they would have to sort of fade within that filter that we put on them for \u2013 so that they\u2019re supportive. Any M&A we do even if it\u2019s bigger, has to be supportive or accretive to our profitability and double-digit growth ambition. So, look we\u2019re constantly looking at things, but I won\u2019t make any specific comments, but just know that part of our thesis is that investing during downturns provides a significant return down the road. So, and that\u2019s what that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing, I will be doing.\nBlake Gendron: Yes, that\u2019s totally fair. The framework is very helpful. Thanks a lot for the time.\nAntonio Pietri: Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Jason.\nJason Celino: Hello. Hi, thanks for fitting me in. Maybe it\u2019s just two quick ones. When I look at the Q4 annual spend guidance for the implied Q4 annual spend guidance, it seems very weak, sequential increase, much more subdued than a typical Q4. Is this more of a reflection of the added dynamic around the uncertainty on customer purchasing decisions?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, we\u2019ve heard \u2013 we\u2019re being very careful about Q4, we\u2019ve had two quarters where we came into the very end of the quarter thinking that we\u2019re going to deliver, good, solid quarters, and it did not materialize. So, you would expect us to be more cautious about the Q4 performance. What I\u2019ve told you is, we came into the quarter with a very sizable pipeline of business. But at the same time, we\u2019ve been beaten twice by expectation, so we\u2019re being more cautious.\nJason Celino: Okay. And then, before we were thinking that annual spend growth could possibly trough over the next couple quarters. This framework still, apply but maybe deeper troughs and what we expected?\nAntonio Pietri: I mean, look, we\u2019ll talk about 2022. But I think in a wave, we\u2019ve sort of been established a pattern of growth in three quarters in a row. We\u2019ll see what Q4 does, our Q4 last year was a very strong quarter. But I don\u2019t necessarily think that customers understood what was ahead of all of us with a pandemic. But we\u2019ll see, the Q1 and Q2 quarters, this year, I think are representative of the full impact of the pandemic and everything that was going on uncertainty. So, I think, if it was a continuation of some of the issues around the world with a pandemic, you could be seeing similar quarters in Q1 and Q2. But we\u2019ll talk about more specifically at later in the year.\nJason Celino: Okay. Excellent. Well, I appreciate the time. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll now hand it back to our CEO Antonio Pietri for any closing remarks.\nAntonio Pietri: All right. Thank you, Operator. And look, I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. I know it\u2019s busy times during earnings season, and look forward to doing callbacks with all of you and I\u2019m fully vaccinated. So hopefully, meeting in person at some point here in the in the future. Thank you everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chantelle Breithaupt",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 ending March 31, 2021. I'm Chantelle Breithaupt, CFO of AspenTech, and with me on the call is, Antonio Pietri, President and CEO. Before we begin, I will make the Safe Harbor statement that during the course of this call we may make projections or other forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from such projections or statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's call and contained in our most recently filed Form 10-Q. Also, please note that the following information relates to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, April 28, 2021. Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. The structure of today's call will be as follows. Antonio will discuss business highlights from the third quarter and then I will review our financial results and discuss our updated guidance for fiscal year 2021. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio? Thank you, Antonio, I appreciate those kind words. I am thrilled to be here at AspenTech to help lead the company through its next stage of growth. I am impressed by what I've seen in my few weeks with the company and the incredible passion that we have to deliver value for customers. I look forward to getting to know many of you in the weeks and months ahead. I'll start today with a review of our financial results for the third quarter fiscal 2021. As a reminder, these results are being reported under topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings and more specifically, renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term licensed contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years, and this nonlinearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods. In our view, annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business and annual free cash flow. The most important metric for assessing the overall value our business generates. Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for our term license agreements at the end of each period was $609.9 million at the end of the third quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 6% on a year-over-year basis and 1% sequentially. Total bookings which we define as the total value of customer term license contract signed in the current period, less the value of term license contract signed in the current period, but where the initial licenses were not yet being delivered under topic 606. Plus term license contract signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period was $175.6 million, a 39% increase year-over-year. The growth in bookings was heavily influenced by the timing of renewals, which represent the majority of our bookings in a given period. Total Revenue was $162.7 million for the third quarter a 25% increase from the prior year period. The year-over-year increase in revenue was the result of the increase in total bookings discussed above. Turning to profitability beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $77.8 million, compared to $70.1 million in the year ago period. Total expenses including cost of revenue were $93.8 million, which was up from $85.9 million in the year ago period. Operating income was $68.9 million, and net income for the quarter was $62.5 million or $0.91 per share. Turning to non-GAAP results, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition related fees. We reported non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter of $80.9 million, representing a 49.7% non-GAAP operating margin compared to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $53.9 million and 41.3% respectively in the year ago period. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period-to-period due the timing of customer renewals and therefore licensed revenue recognized during the quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $72 million or $1.05 per share based on $68.6 million shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the quarter with approximately $317 million of cash and cash equivalents and $300 million outstanding under our credit facility. In the third quarter, we generated $98.7 million of cash from operations and $100 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and acquisition related payments. We are pleased with our cash flow performance so far in fiscal 2021, which demonstrates the consistent profitability of our business and good performance by our collections team. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables within our press release which is also available on our website. I would now like to close with guidance. With respect to annual spend growth as Antonio mentioned, we are now forecasting 4% to 5.5% annual spend growth. We now expect bookings in the range of $771 million to $809 million, which includes $519 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2021. This includes approximately $146 million of contracts up for renewal in the fourth quarter. We now expect revenue in the range of $705 million to $729 million. We expect license revenue in the range of $492 million to $516 million and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $187 million and $26 million, respectively. The change in our bookings and revenue outlook reflect the impact of our more muted annual spend growth outlook. From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $355 million to $360 million. Taken together, we expect GAAP operating income at a range of $350 million to $369 million for fiscal 2021 with GAAP net income of approximately $306 million to $321 million. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $4.46 to $4.70. From a non-GAAP perspective, we expect non-GAAP operating income of $395 million to $415 million and non-GAAP income per share in the range of $4.98 to $5.22. From a free cash flow perspective, we continue to target free cash flow of $265 million to $275 million. Our fiscal 2021 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments in the range of $60 million to $70 million. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is typically our largest invoicing quarter with a significant number of our quarterly invoices due on June 30. To summarize, we are managing through some extraordinary dynamics in our core markets. The fact that we continue to grow and generate substantial free cash flow is a reflection of the value we deliver to customers and demonstrates the strength of our business model, we are confident that we will begin to see a meaningful improvement and growth rates as the market conditions normalize. With that operator, let's begin the Q&A please. Yes. I think Jackson, great to get to know you. I will defer to Antonio for that specific question, if that's okay, regarding suites. Yes, no. Hi. Nice to meet Rob, Thank you. I think that's a \u2013 we are still within the range that we have some guiding. What I would say, to be fair is what we see as bumping up the higher point of that range as we get into Q4 Rob, to your question. So, still the range but probably more towards the higher part of that range as we get the pressures Antonio mentioned during Q4. So hopefully that answers your question in regard to the ranges maintaining and we see pressure to get to the higher point in that range, but not moving above that range at this time. Yes, I think that \u2013 and nice to meet you Gal. I think that if I understand your question correctly. Your question was, if we are seeing more slips through the quarter during this environment, if I understand your question correctly, is that correct? Yes. Yes, I don't think that, I think Antonio said there could be one or two during this time period that that slipped or became a new deal because of the timing on their sides. There are if you think about what some of our customers are going through right now, just the organization and the capabilities to put that all together on time for the renewal. I wouldn't say that there's anything indicating there's a trend for that to happen. And therefore, the new deals were likely more than new deals, but not slipped renewal deals for the majority. I don't see an increased trend in that, if that's the question. Thank you."

            "name": "Antonio Pietri",
            "content": "Thanks, Chantelle, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I want to start by welcoming Chantelle to AspenTech. Chantelle add significant experience to the senior management team. And I've been impressed by her financial and operational acumen and energy she's brought to the company in the weeks since she joined us. Let's start by looking quickly at our financial results for the quarter. Revenue was $162.7 million. GAAP EPS was $0.91, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.05. Annual spend was $609.9 million up 1% in the quarter and 6% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $100 million. Overall, our third quarter performance was below our expectations. While we continue to have a meaningful pipeline of business, it remained a challenging environment to complete transactions. We had expected purchasing dynamics with customers to improve modestly in the third quarter. However, it was broadly consistent with what we experienced in the second quarter. Our assessment of growth in Q3 was predicated on the quality of conversations with customers and their commitment to a sequence of event that have historically indicated a high likelihood of closing these transactions. As a quarter closed, many of these transactions did not received final approval at the highest level of our customers organizations and approval step that is new, or has been historically a predictable final step. We believe there were several factors that played a role in the quarter. First, the unexpected polar vortex weather event in February in the United States, and specifically in Texas, and many of the key energy producing states force to shutdown of approximately one-third of U.S. refining capacity, as well as approximately 75% of ethylene capacity and 80% to 85% of polypropylene capacity, equally impacting other chemicals production capacity. Understandably, this emergency shifted customer attention to our shutdowns, repairs, and restart of these assets. With the last few plants finally return to operations only in the past few weeks. These weather events caused the refining and chemicals industry billions of dollars in revenue and incremental expenses has been reported by these companies. One refining company reported taking an accounting charge in the quarter of between $520 million and $535 million due to higher electricity and natural gas cost alone. We believe the economic impact from these storms placed additional pressure on budget and made it very difficult for customers to commit to new spend in addition. Second, continued COVID-related lockdowns around the world, particularly in Europe and India are delaying the economic recovery in this regions and creating a significant distress for the local refining industry, as higher oil prices and tepid fuel demand of depressed refining margins. This was also the case until recently in the United States. But as economic activity has accelerated here, margins have improved in the last few weeks. And third, these dynamics combined with calendar 2021 budgets that are reflective of the uncertain macro environment and mid $40 oil price. At the time, when they were said laid in calendar 2020 created a difficult spending environment. In light of our recent performance and the current market outlook, we're now taken are more cautious outlook on growth in fiscal 2021. It is important to know that, although we did not experience any significant losses in the third quarter, our updated outlook is based mostly in the decision making pattern by some customers. Although we continue to have significant customer engagements and demand generation activity at the top of our sales funnel, that support a pipeline of business that is broadly consistent with pre pandemic levels. We believe it is prudent to assume that the elevated level of late no decisions by customers in recent quarters could persist until at least the end of this fiscal year. As a result, we're adjusting the range for annual spend growth to 4% to 5.5%. Our initial guidance for the year laid out a wider than normal range of potential outcomes. And our updated outlook reflects first lower gross growth driven by curtailed spending and refining and chemicals, which has impacted our MSC business and lower growth contribution from APM consistent with the pattern experienced in the fiscal year, and second attrition that will come in at approximately 6%. I would like to spend a few minutes providing more color on what we're seeing in the market. As we discussed in depth at our Investor Day earlier this year, digitalization and sustainability are two of the most important investment priorities in the process and capital intensive industries. Customers recognize that AspenTech solutions are critically important to successfully executing in these areas, and meeting their goal of running assets safer, greener, longer, faster and more profitably. Our overall pipeline of opportunities has continued to grow each quarter since the pandemic began. And in particular, we're seeing growing engagement with customers for sustainability related activities. We're excited by the conversations we're having with customers, and they give us confidence in our long-term, double-digit annual spend growth prospects despite the short-term challenge we're facing. The macro environment has remained less predictable than originally anticipated, proving difficult for customers to commit to new spending in the near-term. We believe there are ways for our sales organization to adapt to this new environment. But this will likely only have a modest impact until macro conditions improve or normalize. The end market most impacted by macro conditions relative to our expectations is refining. Although customer engagement remains high, refining utilization rate, and margins remain below historical trends, even as they have shown improvement from last year's lows in the United States. Fuel demand continues to be well below pre pandemic levels and during the quarter lock downs \u2013 and during the quarter lockdowns persisted in certain key regions most notably Europe and India. The cumulative impact of the past year has weighed on operating budgets and refiners ability to make incremental investments in their operations. We believe this is a temporary dynamic that will reverse itself as macro conditions improve across the world. However, in the near-term, we would characterize business conditions with refiners as amongst the most challenging in the last 10 years to 15 years, and a notable difference from the last market cycle five years ago. Conversely, as we've discussed on recent calls, chemical customers have shown good resiliency about spending soft-in, in the quarter, which could be a transitory issue reflecting the factors mentioned earlier in my remarks. These customers are focused on the longer term needs of their businesses and recognize the critical value AspenTech provides by enabling assets to operate in a more efficient and environmentally sustainable manner. Turning to the E&C market, our performance was largely as expected. The E&C industry continues to adjust to current CapEx spending, which is leading to higher attrition levels and lower new spend activity. As a reminder, these customers continue to use and deploy AspenTech solutions extensively across their operations, and changes in their spending levels are result of having fewer projects in backlog. We continue to have very close and active engagements with our E&C customers and understand the near-term challenges as well as exciting long-term opportunities in this market. In APM, we continue to see significant interest from customers as pilot activity remains at record levels. The combination of reduced operating rates in this asset and lower spending on maintenance has had a pronounced impact on closed rates in APM. We saw a continuation of the trend towards no decisions in many of our sales cycles. The increase in customer interest and successful pilot deployments have created a significant pipeline of various transactions that are available to be signed once market conditions improve. We have made important progress in improving now the value proposition for APM for many customers in our core industries and GEIs, which gives us confidence that APM can grow significantly faster over the long-term. We did close a number of transactions for APM in the mining and pulp and paper industries, including some minor transactions in our core industries, and most notably expanded the use of Aspen Mtell for an integrated oil company in Europe to one of their biofuel refineries. Finally, we have made good progress in building out our dedicated pharma unit, including the go-to-market teams. We believe the pharma market represents a significant growth opportunity for AspenTech and it's an area in which we plan to continue to invest. Following our highlights of a couple of transactions we closed in the quarter. First, a global chemical company headquartered in Europe, and long-term user of our engineering and MSC suites was offered by an AspenTech competitor the opportunity to replace our engineering suite by granting a free no cost license to their technology for three years after a careful evaluation by the customer of the capabilities of both solutions, the customer proceeded to renew the agreement for our engineering suite as well as growth span by expanding use to site in Asia and other recently acquire locations. Second, longer term European customer of AspenTech selected Aspen GDOT to expand use of the multi unit optimization technology to a second refinery. Aspen GDOT was selected after the customer concluded a competitive tender process originally kicked off in April 2020 and postponed multiple times due to the pandemic. The customer is looking to increase profitability at the second refinery by improving operational performance. Third and final, a new customer to AspenTech and meet your mining company in Australia signed a transaction to deploy Aspen Mtell at two mining sites in Australia after conducting a pilot for the technology. The pilot was kicked off during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2021. The value of Aspen Mtell's predictive capability was proven during the second quarter, and the transaction was signed this past quarter. Aspen Mtell was selected for being a commercially available software application, industrial equipment agnostic, fast to deploy and for providing a clear value proposition to reduce operational downtime. This success will lead to further rollout of Aspen Mtell to other mining sites in the future and creates opportunity for other AspenTech products with this company. As we look forward, we're focused on managing and executing against the things that are in our control to ensure were best positioned to benefit from an improved macro environment as quickly as possible. In particular, we continue to make excellent progress in building out and expanding our market leading product portfolio. The market is responding to our vision of the self optimizing plant and how we can leverage artificial intelligence across our solutions. Feedback on both aspenONE v12 and the AIoT Hub has been very positive. For example, a U.S. chemical manufacturer has been drawn to our v12 offering as a way to democratize AI access and utilization in their business. They have noted that our AI power model building workflow is a very user friendly way to build artificial intelligence models without having existing resources trained in advanced computer science. For them, if we put AI functionality directly into the hands of the manufacturing technical personnel, where it is needed most. We believe our recently introduced innovations combined with our existing technology and 40 years of domain expertise reflect a compelling product market fit that meets our customers strategic priorities have improved efficiency and reduced environmental impact. We have introduced a tremendous amount of innovation over the past year, which provides for a number of different opportunities for faster growth over time. Whether it is hybrid engineering models, Aspen GDOT, the AIoT Hub, Aspen Enterprise Insights for any of our other recent innovations, we have more ways to deliver value for customers than at any point in our history. We will continue to make significant investments in our product portfolio and go-to-market efforts to best position the company for the long-term. We have great confidence in our business and believe our ability to invest through all the stages of the economic cycle, it strengthens our market position and ability to deliver on our long term objectives. We're also hosting Bi-Annual OPTIMIZE Conference on May 18 through the 21, where we will continue to engage customers across all the innovation we have released and our long term historical products. This will be our first virtual customer conference and it is generating significant interest with 1000s of customers now registered. We have a strong lineup of sessions and speakers, with the technical sessions being oversubscribed from customer's interest to present how our solutions are being leveraged to create value and improve sustainability in their operations. We look forward to your participation as well. From a capital allocation perspective, we did not repurchase any shares in the first three quarters of fiscal year 2021. And we anticipate that it is unlikely that we will meet our previously stated intent of repurchasing $200 million of stock in fiscal year 2021. The lack of share repurchase activity in recent quarters was driven in large part by practical limitations, namely a lack of available open windows to reinstitute our buyback. We have a demonstrated track record of deploying capital to drive shareholder value through our prior business cycles. Our capital allocation framework and philosophy has remained the same. Invest organically in our business, in organically with acquisitions, and where business and market conditions allow us return excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases. Finally, I would like to welcome the two newest members of AspenTech's Board of Directors, Karen Golz and Jill Smith. Karen is a retired Ernst & Young partner who held a number of senior positions in her 40 year career with a company including as global Vice Chair of E&Y, Japan, and its professional practice and professional ethics and independence. We're excited to add Karen's expertise and experience to AspenTech's Board. Jill has more than 20 years of international business leadership in diverse industries, most recently serving as President and CEO of Allied Minds, an IP commercialization company for technology and Life Sciences. And an earlier in her career as CEO and President of Digital Globe, and a partner of Bain and Company. We're excited to add the diverse expertise and experience of Karen and Jill to AspenTech's Board. Before I turn the call over to Chantelle, I want to reiterate the inherent strength of our business and our continued confidence in its long term growth opportunities. Even as many of our customers face a challenging environment, we believe we will grow our business 4% to 5.5% in fiscal 2021 and generate industry leading margins. As the impact of the pandemic phase and economic conditions improve. We expect our business will begin to realize the customer demand as has built up over the past year. We're well positioned to benefit from our investment priorities that we believe will sustain double-digit annual spend growth for years to come. Now, let me turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle? Hi, Matt? Yes, I mean, I'd say that perhaps the dynamic that is new in this cycle that we certainly didn't see and did not have in the last cycle in 2016 and 2017 is with our refining customers. Clearly, since last April, the significant drop-in fuel demand has had an impact on their business. But I think more importantly, or equally important, as oil prices have increased later in the year in 2020 and into 2021 their margins really compressed in some cases experiencing negative margins. And I think that lead to a pullback in spending by these customers. Now in the United States, refining margins have actually improved quite a bit in the last few weeks as the economy has opened up and traveling has pick up so we see that but they remain depressed in Europe in parts of Asia and they'll probably continue until economic activity recover. So that's primarily the new dynamic and that's impacting the MSC business in particular, and also the engineering business or out of those customers. We believe that the softening of demand from our chemicals customer in Q3 had more to do in the U.S. with a weather event or they experienced in over Texas and other states. But I think it's a refining business, the new dynamic that we're seeing. Yes, look certainly we do think that, budgets that were said late last year were sort of discipline budget, if you will. At the same time, I do think the dynamics in Europe with continuation of lockdowns, and in India for example, we're going on right now. And then the weather event as those disappear, certainly the weather event only lasts, the duration of it was very short-term, but the impact was longer term only in the last few weeks. Some of those assets have returned to operation. But look, I think in the second half of this year, these customers on a global basis will probably have a better, better financial performance. How does that translate into spending in the second half of the year? Look, time will tell and we'll, of course, we will be engaged with those customers. But I, then again, later in the year, we'll be looking at new budgets with a completely different macro environment. So, we'll see what happens at that point. Thank you. Hi, Jackson Well, look first of all, we have truly rigorous approval processes for deals. And I can tell you the one of the largest deals that we had in our Q2 quarter, we did not give the sales team, the approval that we're looking for to close the deal in Q2, that deal came over to Q3 and we finally managed to get to an agreement with the customer. It turned out that one normally is a customer that is very reliable, once we have an agreement with procurement to sign the deal. But the deal was sent to the CEO, which is never the case. But this time around was sent to the CEO for final approval. And the CEO held it along with other agreements that they were negotiating with other providers. So look, we monitor the health of our business. And of course, we have escalation levels for approvals internally. We will walk away from deals if we don't think is the right deal to be had with a customer. We're also not conducting a fire sale of our products here. But we do find look, you have a smaller pie of opportunities at the moment in the market are the weaker competitors are being very aggressive, just like they were in 2016 and 2017 absolutely the same behavior. And look, if anything, it strengthens our commitment to the value proposition from our products, when you have a customer that has an offer on the table to use a software of a competitor for three years at no charge, and they still decide to go with us then take and expand spend. So, I understand your point. But at the same time, we do see the pressure on pricing. But I like to think that, we run a business where we understand the value from our solutions. We will make accommodations if we believe it makes sense in the context of the macro. But in general, our customers have pre negotiated future token prices in their agreements that we have been negotiated over the last five years. And that is what's used for their purchases if they want to expand entitlement during this downturn. Yes, look. Thank you, Chantelle, and look Jackson, the APM suite, we continue to be very excited about it. The fact is that the use cases continue to expand into other industries. Now, it's been deployed at a biofuels refinery as well. But the contribution was not what, we expected in the quarter again, as the lower guidance also means lower contribution from APM. And we believe that now APM will probably come below the one point of contribution. Now, we have a wide range of outcomes for APM in Q4. And, if we get a surprise on the upside, there could be a lot of strength in APM, but we're not going to rely on that. And the guidance \u2013 overall guidance we've given for the business also reflects lower end of our guidance for APM or expectations around APM. Yes, no problem. Thank you. Hi, Rob. Yes, no, look I mean, actually, a lot of the dynamics that we're seeing in the cycle we saw five years ago. If anything, our footprint in the market has strengthened across the board, our engineering suite, at the moment, we believe will actually probably be a little bit ahead of our growth projections for the year. We do expect our MSC suite now to be a double-digit grower this year. The impact from refining is much more pronounced on the MSC suite. And then our APM suite, we've communicated what we're saying with that suite. So, but look, it's not as if we're losing on APM it's not decisions. MSC is just a temporary low in spending on refining. And also softening in chemicals, which to me, it says that we had some dynamics in Q3, that perhaps were very specific to chemicals to the macro environment for chemicals. And then the engineering suite is doing a little \u2013 is ahead of our expectations a little bit. So, but now look, we're doing well from a competitive standpoint. Yes. I mean, Rob, and Rob, what I would add to Chantelle's answer. For the first time, we did see a couple of important customers and the engineering side in owner operators, and lead their renewals, expired and then renew them into this quarter. And toward there was a sign of a little bit of disorganization in their own organizations. They've renewed by the way we count for attrition is attrition, if it doesn't get renew, and if it comes back, it's growth. So, we expect those yields to renew so or to get sign as new business. So but look, there's a lot of dynamics in the marketplace at the moment and around the world. And in some cases, we've seen a little bit of disorganization in our customers, businesses as well. Yes, no problem. Hi, Gal? Yes. So Gal, I guess just to clarify that, I don't know if your questions are specific to maybe an over performance of the book inside versus expectations. But \u2013 look yes, so no, we look at we're renewing the core of what's available to us. The fact is that I'm not aware necessarily of any material renewal that we accelerated into the quarter, I think that over performance that you're seeing has to do with the way we account for bookings, super seats and other stuff that where there are some parts of bookings are get recognized in the quarter from past quarter. So, I mean maybe Chantelle can add more color to that. Yes, basically on a, let's say you're on a five year deal, your deal's off renewal, like, did you have instances with renew just the normal renewal cadence of the bill would have kind of been disrupted and slipped into the quarter were those all kind of new deals that didn't get closed, because they didn't get approved? Were there any issues with the renewal deals that were supposed to be just as automatically or programmatically kind of renewed, but those got pushed out? So those probably carry lower risk and into subsequent quarters. Well, look, Gal, like I said, in my prepared remarks, we still have a lot of conviction about the ability to deliver double-digit growth in the longer term. The trajectory to get there we'll give you an update on what we think we're going to be able to do in fiscal 2022 later in the year when we do our earnings call for fiscal 2021. But, look in general, say, the engagement with our customers only continues to strengthen. The conversations around sustainability, are becoming more and more frequent, how our customers are viewing us as a strategic supplier of capabilities to help them navigate this environment and their businesses and transform their businesses for the future continues to strengthen. So, I think overall, and I've said it before, I've never been as excited about the future of this company as I am today. In a way, we misread the environment that our customers were facing, especially refiners. I do think that in Q3, there were very specific events that played a role in our performance. But that doesn't change our conviction, about our ability to drive double-digit growth in the future and that's what we're working here to do. Including pulling towards investments that we put to work this fiscal year, and reaping the benefits of those investments over the next two to three years, three to five years. That's what we're here playing for. Not at all. Not at all. And I would just add that we continue to see even greater interest from third parties, potential partners, to work with us in going to market to these customers, because they understand the role that we play in this marketplace, in our core industries. And that's also to us an indication of how we're being pursued in the market by customers and third parties. So, I think you're taking the right take away from this. Yes. So, let me say the following. Certainly there's a few engineering companies that have reduced headcount. But nothing at all, like what we saw five years ago, I think engineering companies have been very disciplined about hiring. And they've been managing their backlogs in a way that allows them to sustain their businesses, even through this downturn. So, I would say that. The other point, the beginning of your question, around sort of reduce CapEx environment. Look, actually, I think in a way that that provides a counter driver for more focused in technology. When you engage owner operators, and refining and chemical, they all recognize that they are in a lower CapEx environment for a number of years here. And as such, they need to focus on their existing assets, and improve their performance, improve on the reliability of these assets, in general, continue to drive greater operational excellence. And every customer that I meet with at the executive level, the first thing they show us is their list of 40 or 50 or 60 initiatives as part of an operational excellence program that they're focusing on to drive more value out of their existing assets. And those range from certainly digital capabilities in their offices and personnel to reliability assets, maintenance of those, there's probably a list of 10 or 15 that in a way belong to AspenTech. And there's a lot of actually excitement in our customer base about the next two to three, three to five years, I find, what I find and actually, I told my board this last week, there's a tremendous dichotomy between what you hear in the news, in general about what's going to happen to these industries. And then what you hear from customers, about what they view is our outlook for their businesses in chemicals and refining over the next two to three years. Certainly, there's parts of the world where, there's going to be some challenges, especially in refining. But look, I think, I think greater economic activity coming out of the pandemic we'll rise all boats. And these companies provide the energy, the chemicals, and plastics that improve standards of living and drive economic activity. So, time will tell what happens here. But, we're also very excited about the future so. Look, we'll never discuss potential M&A. But what I'll tell you is, we've certainly put our foot to the pedal on organic investments in fiscal 2021. You'll see some of that, coming out of our Q4 quarter into fiscal 2022. Because we believe that accelerated investments over the last six months to nine months, will allow us to increase our lead on the competition as we come out of all this. So, we've been making investments, as we've been communicating to all of you over the last 12 months in the different areas that we've talked about. Certainly, inorganic M&A is always part of our picture. We've always said that we're interested in doing bigger acquisitions, especially into these new industries that we talk about. But they would have to sort of fade within that filter that we put on them for \u2013 so that they're supportive. Any M&A we do even if it's bigger, has to be supportive or accretive to our profitability and double-digit growth ambition. So, look we're constantly looking at things, but I won't make any specific comments, but just know that part of our thesis is that investing during downturns provides a significant return down the road. So, and that's what that's what we're doing, I will be doing. Fair enough. Thank you. Hi, Jason. Yes. Look, we've heard \u2013 we're being very careful about Q4, we've had two quarters where we came into the very end of the quarter thinking that we're going to deliver, good, solid quarters, and it did not materialize. So, you would expect us to be more cautious about the Q4 performance. What I've told you is, we came into the quarter with a very sizable pipeline of business. But at the same time, we've been beaten twice by expectation, so we're being more cautious. I mean, look, we'll talk about 2022. But I think in a wave, we've sort of been established a pattern of growth in three quarters in a row. We'll see what Q4 does, our Q4 last year was a very strong quarter. But I don't necessarily think that customers understood what was ahead of all of us with a pandemic. But we'll see, the Q1 and Q2 quarters, this year, I think are representative of the full impact of the pandemic and everything that was going on uncertainty. So, I think, if it was a continuation of some of the issues around the world with a pandemic, you could be seeing similar quarters in Q1 and Q2. But we'll talk about more specifically at later in the year. Thank you, Jason. All right. Thank you, Operator. And look, I want to thank everyone for joining the call today. I know it's busy times during earnings season, and look forward to doing callbacks with all of you and I'm fully vaccinated. So hopefully, meeting in person at some point here in the in the future. Thank you everyone."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Karl Johnsen, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nKarl Johnsen: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 ending December 31, 2020. I'm Karl Johnsen, CFO of AspenTech, and with me on the call is Antonio Pietri, President and CEO. Before we begin, I will make the safe harbor statement that during the course of this call, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results may differ materially from such projections or statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's call and contained in our most recently filed Form 10-Q. Also, please note that the following information relates to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, January 27, 2021. Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. The structure of today's call will be as follows: Antonio will discuss business highlights from the second quarter, and then I will review our financial results and discuss our updated guidance for fiscal year 2021. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, Karl. And thank you all for joining us today. We hope all of you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. Let's start by looking quickly at our financial results for the second quarter. Revenue was $233.7 million, supported by the largest dollar amount of quarterly renewals in the fiscal year. GAAP EPS was $1.89, and non-GAAP EPS was $2.04. Annual spend was $604 million, up 1.3% in the quarter and 7% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $38 million. AspenTech's performance in the second quarter was solid given the current economic environment, and we remain on track to deliver a good year of growth in fiscal 2021. We continue to be confident in our ability to return to double-digit annual spend growth once economic conditions normalize. In the second quarter, we are particularly pleased with our renewals performance in what was the largest renewals quarter in our history. Our customers continue to make substantial long-term commitments to AspenTech in a clear demonstration of our technologies' strategic importance to their operations. One of the highlights of the quarter was signing one of our biggest ever licensed bookings transaction, a renewal for more than $75 million with one of the largest global oil companies. From a growth perspective, our engineering and MSC Suites delivered growth in line with our expectations, and the APM Suite came in below plan. While our conversations with customers throughout the quarter were positive, we saw certain customers take a more conservative outlook on spending in late December that we believe was due in part to the recent wave of COVID-related restrictions in many parts of the world. Overall, demand activity across our portfolio remains strong. We are engaged in strategic conversations with customers in all our target markets to expand our investments in AspenTech solutions to achieve critical business needs and enable their assets to run safer, greener, longer and faster. In fact, our demand generation and top of sales funnel business activity are performing at levels similar to what we experienced prior to the onset of COVID. We believe this is a positive indication about the opportunity for strong growth in the second half of fiscal 2021 and beyond. Based on our first half performance and current outlook for the second half of the year, we are tightening the range for annual spend growth to6% to 8% compared to our previous range of 6% to 9%. As we laid out at the beginning of the fiscal year, we faced a higher degree of uncertainty in fiscal 2021 and a wider-than-normal range of potential outcomes. The underlying assumptions in our updated guidance include: APM will contribute 1.25 points of growth, down from two points; attrition in the upper half of the 5% to 6% range we provided at the beginning of the year. It is important to note that we have already incurred a significant portion of our expected annual attrition in the first half of the year, given the timing of renewals so we expect attrition will have less impact on annual spend growth in the second half of the year. We expect similar growth expectations for our Engineering and MSC Suites. From a profitability perspective, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance to $265 million to $275 million, supported by strong collections and lower expenses. I would like to spend a few minutes providing an update on trends in each of our core markets. Chemicals continued to show good resilience and was the best performance vertical for AspenTech in the quarter. Overall, we have seen a slow and steady improvement in the chemicals market, with the segments benefiting from the current economic environment more than offsetting the parts of the industry that are facing challenges. As we have discussed in the past, digitalization is a top strategic priority and consistent area of investment for chemical companies. Increasingly, this industry recognizes that it must operate in a more efficient and environmentally sustainable manner in order to remain competitive and viable in the long term. AspenTech solutions are mission-critical in achieving these objectives, which gives us confidence we will continue to generate consistent growth in this market. To that end, we recently joined the Alliance to End Plastic Waste as an enabler company contributing capital, technology and expert resources. The AEPW organization is a global-nonprofit focused on building a more sustainable plastic value chain to achieve its mission of ending plastic waste in the environment. An example of the continued focus by chemical customers on digitalization and sustainability is the transaction signed with a North American chemical customer looking to maximize production and efficiency through optimal asset performance. After working with their digitalization group to evaluate our technologies, they selected Aspen ProMV to deliver more consistent quality, less waste, longer uptime and maintenance spend reduction, generating millions of dollars in annual benefits. The refining business for oil and gas companies and the independent refiners continues to face a challenging business environment related to changes in travel patterns due to COVID. The reduced demand for gasoline and jet fuel has had a pronounced impact on demand, resulting in operating rates below their historical levels. Refining margins have improved recently from the lows experienced in the middle of calendar 2020, but are still below their historical trend. We continue to have positive conversations with our refining customers, which remain committed to investing in digitalization technologies from AspenTech that will enable more efficient, agile and flexible asset operations in the future. We signed a number of transactions in the quarter with refinery operators that expand usage of our products and solutions across the different regions of the world for both our engineering and MSC suites. We are also encouraged by a growing trend we are seeing where MSC products and best practices continue to migrate from refining to the midstream and upstream businesses of our customers. For example, a South American customer that is an important user of our Aspen PIMS-AO solution for refinery planning optimization identified significant benefits from deploying an enterprise-wide planning optimization solution that extends from their refining assets to their upstream and midstream businesses to optimize the production and supply of crude oil in their operations. This enterprise planning optimization solution represents millions of dollars in incremental value capture in their logistics operations. A second example is a Europe-based integrated oil company that is extending the use of Aspen DMC3 and Aspen digital solutions to their upstream facilities. This customer has a decarbonization strategy to reduce CO2 emissions in line with the United Nations 2030 objectives. We worked with the customer in its main European upstream and midstream facilities to demonstrate how advanced process control could help decrease production costs as well as CO2 emissions. The pilot demonstrated a 15% reduction in CO2 emissions. As a result, the customer decided to roll out Aspen DMC3 and Aspen GDOT across the full site. A unique aspect of this pilot project was a remote deployment of our advanced control technology due to COVID restrictions. Turning to the E&C market. Our performance was as expected in the second quarter and first half of the year. Attrition levels have been in line with the range of expectations as these customers right size their agreements to reflect the current CapEx reality. We have a multi-decade history in the E&C market have a very good understanding of its industry dynamics and how demand trends typically play out through economic cycles. We are confident in our ability to manage through the current environment while also being focused on emerging areas like third-party operations and maintenance services for brownfield assets. In the APM area, the suite contributed 0.3 points of growth to annual spend through the first half of the year, which is behind where we expected to be at this point in the year. The Aspen ProMV product in the suite continues to increase its contribution to growth. As mentioned earlier, the challenging market backdrop for our customers and their focus on cash conservation has impacted our ability to close Aspen Mtell transactions and outweighed growing customer interest. We remain confident this is a near-term dynamic based on our customer conversations and pilot completions and a significant value and success existing customers are having with their APM deployments. We continue to have a strong APM pipeline that includes a record number of in-flight or completed Aspen Mtell pilots. These pilots have successfully demonstrated the value of the product to prospective customers and gives us confidence growth will improve as the macro environment normalizes. We have also been cataloging successes from the Aspen installed base that demonstrate the tremendous value we can deliver to customers across a range of reliability improvement use cases. We refer to these as catches, potential failures avoided by alerting from Aspen Mtell. For example, Aspen Mtell alerted with 30 days notice the potential rupture of a pipe in a recovery boiler of a pulp and paper mill that could have led to the complete shutdown of it, avoiding upwards of $10 million in losses. Similarly, Aspen Mtell identified a failure in the cooling oil pipes of the compressor section of a hyper compressor in a polypropylene plant, avoiding $150,000 in costs in that one instance. Two months after the deployment of Mtell, the customers has increased plant availability by 35% and reduced downtime periods by 45%, representing avoidance of a significant number of failures. We now have an extensive library of examples where Aspen Mtell is improving reliability and capturing huge value. For some customers, like an LNG producer in South America, the potential value creation from deploying Aspen Mtell was so compelling, it skipped the pilot altogether and put the technology directly in production. The customer understood the differentiating factors and technical advantages of our solution and how we could meet its needs to improve asset reliability, reduce maintenance costs and increase natural gas production. This customer is targeting a 2% improvement in asset availability, which represents millions of dollars annually in additional production. As we look to the second half of the year and beyond, we are as confident as ever in our ability to generate consistent double-digit annual spend growth over time. This confidence is driven not only by the expected benefits of better future economic conditions, but also the multiple significant product announcements we have made in recent months. As we have discussed on our business update call in November, AspenTech's strategy is to be the industrial AI company, by leveraging the strength of our core capabilities in engineering First principles with artificial intelligence capabilities to dramatically increase the value we can deliver to customers and use the AIoT Hub as the environment to deliver that value. The recently launched AIoT Hub is generating great feedback from customers and is quickly building pipeline. During the quarter, we signed our first wins with this solution in the Energy & Chemicals verticals. As a reminder, the IT hub is our cloud-ready architecture that supports the ability to collect vastly more data than ever before to support our new generation of high-value hybrid applications. It also provides important new visualization capabilities and provides an environment for data scientists to leverage machine learning to build their own AI applications within the IoT hub. We are also very pleased with the early feedback we have received on our recent aspenONE v12 release. In particular, we are seeing great customer interest in hybrid models, which combine data collection from the enterprise with artificial intelligence and AspenTech's 40-years of domain expertise and strength in engineering first principles modeling to create the first and most accurate set of hybrid models for the process industries. With v12 and Aspen Hybrid models, we are able to solve very complex problems faster and more accurately than ever before. One example of customer enthusiasm for B v12 was a renewal with increased annual spend commitments by one of our largest E&C customers based in Europe. This customer quickly realizes the potential value from using the hybrid model in a multi case capabilities now available in the v12 Engineering suite. Another important part of our growth strategy is building upon our success in the global economy industries to further diversify our business in this vertical. We had a solid first half of the year in mining and pharmaceuticals, and see significant opportunities for future growth in this market. We recently hired David Lita to a new role in the company as Senior Vice President and General Manager of our Pharmaceuticals business. David is a 25-year pharma industry veteran, including most recently, 18-years at Thermo Fisher Scientific. Where he led a team that generated consistent double-digit software revenue growth. In this new role, baby David will be responsible for shaping AspenTech's product and solutions strategy for the pharma market and leading our go-to-market efforts. We believe the pharma industry is undergoing the structural changes that make it an increasingly attractive market for current and future AspenTech solutions. During the quarter, we made a small but strategically important acquisition targeted at the pharma market. Camo Analytics has developed highly sophisticated technology that applies analytical science to address process and product quality challenges that enable customers to meet compliance requirements while reducing waste. The addition of Camo will strengthen our analytics capabilities and better enable users to analyze large and complex data sets quickly, easily and accurately. At our upcoming Investor Day on Friday, February 12, we will provide an in-depth update on our v12 release, new product innovation and long-term growth strategy, including our point of view on the tailwind that sustainability and digitalization will play in our future. As companies in our core and GI industries manage their transition to lower emission operations and less plastic waste, we believe we will be uniquely positioned to support them. We are very proud of the investments we have made to increase the value AspenTech can deliver for our customers, and we look forward to explaining them in more detail to the investment community in a few weeks. As we have made meaningful investments in our product portfolio and go-to-market efforts, we also continue to generate high levels of profitability and free cash flow. In the second quarter, we generated $38 million of free cash flow, driven by better-than-expected collections, disciplined expense management and COVID-related savings. From a capital allocation perspective, we did not repurchase any shares during the first half of the fiscal year. It is our intention to meet our original goal for the year and repurchase up to $200 million of stock in the second half of fiscal 2020, given business and market conditions. As a reminder, we allocate our capital based on driving shareholder value. Our strong balance sheet and cash generation are competitive advantages for AspenTech that allows us to invest in the business during periods of uncertainty when many of our competitors cannot. We have demonstrated this through prior economic downturns, and we intend to do so again with investments in the AIoT hub, aspen One v12Bele and expanding our capabilities in pharma that I referenced earlier. Our disciplined capital allocation strategy has a demonstrated track record of producing attractive return for shareholders in multiple ways. Before I turn the call over to Karl, I would like to end by emphasizing the enduring strength of our business in the midst of the most significant economic contraction in our lifetimes. AspenTech remains on pace to deliver mid- to high single-digit annual spend and double-digit free cash flow per share growth in fiscal 2021. We believe this reinforces the unique qualities of AspenTech that we have highlighted to investors for years. The combination of mission critical products, deep and long-term customer relationships and a continued focus on operational excellence. We remain focused on supporting our customers and executing in our strategic priorities. We are incredibly excited about the opportunities ahead for AspenTech, and are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable double-digit growth once economic conditions normalize. Now let me turn the call over to Karl. Karl.\nKarl Johnsen: Thanks, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the second quarter fiscal 2021. As a reminder, these results are being reported under topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings, and more specifically, renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years. And this nonlinearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods. In our view, annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business. And annual free cash flow the most important metric for assessing the overall value our business generates. Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for our term license agreements at the end of each period, was approximately $604 million at the end of the second quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 7% on a year-over-year basis and 1.3% sequentially. Total bookings, which we define as the total value of customer term license contracts signed in the current period, was the value of term license contracts signed in the current period but were the initial licenses are not yet deemed delivered under topic 606, plus term license contracts signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period, was $274.4 million, a 144% increase year-over-year. The growth in bookings was heavily influenced by the timing of renewals, including the large renewal with an energy customer that Antonio referenced earlier. Total revenue was $233.7 million for the second quarter, an 85% increase from the prior year period. The year-over-year increase in revenue was the result of the increase in total bookings discussed above. Turning to profitability, beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $70 million compared to $67.5 million in the year-ago period. Total expenses, including cost of revenue, were $84.3 million, which was up from $83.1 million in the year-ago period. Operating income was $149.5 million and net income for the quarter was $129.2 million or $1.89 per share. Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition-related fees, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter of $162.2 million, representing a 69.4% non-GAAP operating margin compared to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $52.1 million and 41.4%, respectively, in the year-ago period. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period-to-period due to the timing of customer renewals and therefore, license revenue recognized during the quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $139.3 million or $2.04 per share-based on 68.4 million shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $217.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $304 million outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we paid down approximately $119.2 million on the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility. In the second quarter, we generated $37.8 million of cash from operations and $38 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and acquisition-related payments. We are pleased with our cash flow performance in the second quarter and the first half of the year, which has benefited from better-than-expected cash collections and reduced expense levels. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables within our press release, which is also available on our website. I would now like to close with guidance. We now expect bookings in the range of $805 million to $850 million, which includes $519 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2021. This includes $122 million of contracts up for renewal in the third quarter. With respect to annual spend growth, as Antonio mentioned, we are now forecasting 6% to 8% annual spend growth. In terms of timing, we would expect the linearity of the sequential growth to be similar to recent years, and that the fourth quarter will have more growth than the third quarter. We now expect revenue in the range of $731 million to $760 million. We expect license revenue in the range of $513 million to $542 million, and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $191 million and $27 million, respectively. From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $356 million to $361 million. Taken together, we expect GAAP operating income in the range of $375 million to $399 million for fiscal 2021, with GAAP net income of approximately $328 million to $347 million. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $4.80 to $5.08. From a non-GAAP perspective, we expect non-GAAP operating income of $418 million to $442 million, and non-GAAP income per share in the range of $5.29 to $5.58. From a free cash flow perspective, as Antonio mentioned, we are taking up our free cash flow guidance to $265 million to $275 million compared to $260 million to $270 million previously. Our fiscal 2021 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments in the range of $60 million to $70 million. To wrap up, our second quarter performance in the context of a challenging environment demonstrates the resilience and scalability of our business. We remain focused on executing on the things we can control and ensuring we are best positioned to benefit from any improvement in economic conditions. With that, Operator, let's begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rob Oliver with Baird. Your line is now open.\nRobert Oliver: Hi Antonio, hi Karl. Hi guys thank you very much for taking my question and happy New Year. Just one and then a follow-up. On the APM side, I just want to understand if there are particular verticals where you guys are seeing more of that, I think, Antonio, as you put it, seeking to preserve cash rather than proceed with these projects. Because looking broadly at some of your end markets, they appear to be recovering a bit, certainly, chemicals and some of the commodity prices. So just wondering about what the delta is and the change relative to your guidance on APM and where we shake out right now? And then I have one quick follow-up.\nAntonio Pietri: Okay. Well, I mean, look, certainly, the refining industry is very focused on managing their cash flows, considering the macro that they have been facing. Certainly, upstream is another area. Chemicals, while we had a solid quarter, we have also had a little bit of a pullback in chemicals. But at the same time, look, we signed deals outside of our core industries in mining, and a couple of other industries as well, pharmaceuticals actually as well. So we think this is temporary. And in the quarter, while it wasn't a record quarter for a number of pilots, it was the second largest quarter of pilots we have done just behind the Q1 quarter. And we are projecting that Q3 will probably be a record quarter again for a number of pilots. So we remain confident. It is just that we are seeing a conservative approach from some customers with regards to spending.\nRobert Oliver: Okay. Great. That is helpful, thank you. And then just one follow-up. I know you mentioned you had that, I think, one of your largest renewals of over $75 million with that large oil company. And this is obviously a very big renewal year for you guys. I'm just wondering if we can get some more color on that particular renewal. And it sounds like your comments also relative to the rest of the year and churn seem positive. But I just wanted to get a sense for how customers are looking at these renewals and if you have an opportunity to talk APM with your customers at renewal time to show them that product? Thanks guys.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. No, look, first of all, 12 to 18 months, 24 months before any renewal, we are already engaged with that customer, making sure that not only are they using the entitlement that they have, but that we can also drive up entitlement. This is one of the largest oil companies in the world. It is our largest license bookings transaction ever. A lot goes into doing a renewal like that. But we highlighted, just to give you all a sense for the magnitude of the business that we have with our customers, the volume of business that we were renewing in Q2, and certainly, how relevant our technologies continue to be to these companies that are managing through a very difficult macro environment, but also are focusing on energy transition, sustainability and how they can leverage our solutions going forward. So we are very happy with the outcome of that renewal. And actually, in the out years of that contract, it gets even more interesting. So just signaling that despite the macro environment, there are significant business happening for us as well.\nRobert Oliver: Thank you guys.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nJackson Ader: Hey thanks for taking questions guys. How are you doing? The first question, just sticking with APM. I understand APM below plan and kind of lowering the expectations for this year. But even if I compare it to also a pretty tough calendar first half of 2020, the expectations for APM are actually slightly worse than what you guys added last year. So I mean, is the conservative spending really that much worse or is it also that maybe the pipeline just isn't filling up as you expected?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I mean, look, our pipeline of business has remained flat basically through Q1 and Q2. It hasn't gone up, it hasn't gone down. But the volume of that pipeline that is related to in-flight pilots or completed pilots has increased. And the only thing that I would say about Q1 and Q2 FY 2021 is a couple of quarters that are impacted by the pandemic as opposed to Q1 and Q2 2020. Our Q3 and Q4 quarters in 2020 were impacted by the pandemic, but not Q1 and Q2. So I think the comp is a little bit different. And now we have seen the impact of basically the macro in 2020. So that is what I can say about that.\nJackson Ader: Okay. All right. That is helpful. And then, Karl, just a metric question. What were the bookings up for renewal in the second quarter and the December quarter?\nKarl Johnsen: Yes, it was about $170 million.\nJackson Ader: 170. All right. Perfect, thanks guys.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJason Celino: Thanks. One question on the quarter. With the backdrop of this very big renewal quarter, second quarter annual spend increased sequentially by that 1.3 points that you mentioned. That is lower on a sequential basis compared to previous 2Q over the last couple of years. Was this mainly just driven by the APM business or how should we think about it, given it was such a big renewal quarter?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, look, I think what we said, attrition is tracking to our expectation for the first half of the year. Now we have perfect visibility into the dollar amount of renewals in the first half of the year and the size of the Q2 quarter renewals on a dollar basis. So our assumptions for attrition in the first half correlated to that volume of business. Now we have also said that our engineering and MSC business perform according to expectations, and APM is down. And then the last thing I will say, Jason, is that, again, our overall performance in Q1 and Q2 of 2021 has the impact of the pandemic and oil prices and all of that, while Q1 and Q2 2020 were not impacted by the pandemic. So the comp is very different.\nJason Celino: Got you. Okay. And then one more question. I think last quarter, you talked about one customer renewing with a shorter duration. Have you seen any of that in the most recent quarter or has that activity not come up much?\nAntonio Pietri: No, look, we had a - let me make sure I use the right word, a solid quarter of duration in renewal. So we saw no impact whatsoever. Okay. Great.\nJason Celino: Okay great. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau with William Blair. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Pfau: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask on the cautious spending environment and maybe some detail on why that has a larger impact on the APM business versus engineering and MSC?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. I mean, look, again, I think it has to do with the fact that this new technology, Matt, and it is probably seen as discretionary spending. The fact is that these organizations have maintenance processes in place, and they continue to execute to those. Our engineering and MSC solutions have a long history of creating value, and we continue to see the spend in that area. In APM we have come to the end of quarters and customers have pulled back. I do think we were I mean somewhat unlucky in that towards December, we all started to hear a lot about the increasing cases of COVID and lockdowns and perhaps a deteriorating economic environment and perhaps is what happened in the last two weeks of the quarter for us with some of the transactions that did not close. But look, on the other hand, the fact that throughout the quarter, we continue to execute a high level of pilot. We expect to have a record number of pilots completed in the Q3 quarter also signals to us that there is a lot of interest in the technology and what it can do. And so certainly, we have this sort of dichotomy between a number of pilots being executed and business that is closing. And this, in a way, encourages us in that this is probably a temporary issue. And once the macro environment gets back to a more normal environment, we will start to see some of this pent-up demand that we see in our pipeline.\nMatthew Pfau: Got it. And then I wanted to ask on the pharma business. Any other significant investments that you need to make there, whether from a sales perspective or potentially acquiring some more industry-specific functionality? And then I guess what would be next on your list or are there any other verticals that make sense to target more directly like what you are doing with the pharma?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. We are standing up. We have been standing up as sales organization in pharma now for a couple of quarters. That is one of the investments that we targeted at the beginning of the fiscal year. We have also made some decisions running additional investments to incorporate pharma - additional pharma-specific capabilities in some of the products that are relevant for the pharma industry. So those are investments that will start to happen this quarter under the guidance and oversight of David. Camo Analytics is certainly an acquisition that we - brings an installed base, and we are excited about. But ultimately, we have always said that in any industry that we operate in, we want to be number one or number two in the segments, the product segments or solutions segment that we are in. And in the case of pharma, if we find the right acquisition and I won't go into what we mean by that, I have explained that to investors all the time. We would be open to that, but we have our criteria around best-in-class profitability and double-digit growth, and that is the lens that we look at anything through, including in pharma. Look, metals and mining is another industry that we believe it is interesting as well. I think there is an opportunity to create value. We are creating a significant value in already metals and mining for some customers with our APM solution. I think the AIoT Hub and our data historian could play a big role in that industry as well. But there is also a whole software ecosystem in metals and mining that is also attractive. And beyond that, look, you have put and beverage and other industries.\nMatthew Pfau: Great. Thanks guys, I appreciate it.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Gal Munda with Berenberg Capital. Your line is now open.\nGal Munda: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. The first one is just a little bit around one of the largest deals you have signed today. You are talking about the $75 million total contract value. I wanted to kind of just think about - when you think about the last time that deal kind of renewed, can you give us any sort of comparator and what that would be in terms of the ACV are you seeing a significant uplift maybe in terms of what the ACV uplift would have been compared to the previous contract? And where is it coming from? Is it mainly from new modules, like I don't know that you have introduced in the past or is it just higher consumption of tokens in the customer?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, look, what I can say about the historical origins, if you will, of that contract and our relationship with that customer, first of all, it is a relationship that goes back a very long time. This is a customer that this contract has the standard duration that we talk about five to six years. And over that period, when we first signed that renewal, there is been a continuous uptake of technology by that customer and standardization on our solutions across their entire operational ecosystem in refining; in some cases, in upstream; in some cases, in chemicals as well. So the contract has increased significantly since the last renewal. And our expectation is that, that relationship will also continue to grow in the future as they take up some of our new solutions and incorporate hybrid modeling capabilities, the Aspen GDOT product and the new generation of solutions that we are introducing into the market. But very encouraged by that transaction in the midst of everything that is been going on last year.\nGal Munda: Absolutely. That makes a lot of sense. And then just as a follow-up, you were referring to your ambition to return to the double-digit annual spend growth, which is very, very nice to hear. But if I'm thinking about in the context of this year guiding for 6% to 8% increase, thinking what makes you return to that double-digit growth? Is it on one side, higher contribution, better contribution from APM, maybe a couple of percentage points. Or is it also lower attrition or a combination of that in order to get you there?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I mean, I think, Gal, first of all, I invite you all to attend our Investor Day because we will talk about our growth drivers going forward and how we see some of these major trends around sustainability and digitalization supporting our business going forward. So I will say that first. Well, look, in a way, you just have to look at the last five years and the trough in 2017 around sort of low to mid single-digit growth, the level of attrition, how attrition and the glide path of attrition over the following three, four years. You could see that between 2018 and 2019 fiscal, our growth rate jumped from 6.4 to 10.6. So I do believe, and recent history tells us that these periods of macro disruption do hold back spending by our customers. And once the macro normalizes budgets normalize and there is pent-up demand that gets released into better spending on our technologies, so going from 6.4 grow to 10.6. I mean that is a big jump in one year. So I will tell you, Aspen Technology today is not the same company that was five years ago. And I will guarantee you that Aspen Technology will not be the same company in three years and five years than it is today. We have put towards significant investments and including introducing a new generation of capabilities that did not exist up until early October when we released them. And we are going to be releasing a lot more of those capabilities. The AIoT Hub was introduced late at the beginning of Q2 fiscal. Our investments in pharma are new as well. So my expectation and the expectation of everyone in the company is that over the next three to five years, the organization will be transformed again. And furthermore, our technologies, in general, will be very relevant during this energy transition and transition in the chemical industries into a circular economy and plastic waste elimination. So we will talk about all of these during Investor Day, but we are very encouraged by what we are seeing from our customers. The involvement that they expect from AspenTech in this transition that they are planning and are experiencing. And also the role that we have played over 35, 39 years now in reducing emissions through better efficiencies, reducing waste through better optimization. And in general, contributing to what, over the last 35 years, is being considered efficiency to drive profitability. And today is consider efficiencies to drive reductions in emissions, which also equates to better profitability. So I'm very encouraged by our future, and we just have to manage through this rough patch in the macro environment and then come out on the other side with all guns blazing, figurative speech.\nGal Munda: That is very, very clear. I guess it is both double-digit does not mean some percent necessarily, I got it. Thank you very much. I appreciate your color in that.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you. great.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel with Benchmark. Your line is now open.\nMark Schappel: Hi guys, thank you for taking my questions. Antonio, with sustainability becoming an increasing focus with process manufacturers, what are some of the internal initiatives you are doing or what are some of the internal initiatives that are taking place in the company to kind of aligned with your customers' sustainability goals?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, look. So first of all, a lot of what we do today is our technologies can be leveraged to model, well, starting with research new types of compounds and products that are more sustainable, more degradable, better recyclable. And with that, then you have to research and design the process technologies that go into a design and then are built to produce these new compounds at scale. When you think about carbon capture use and sequestration, our technology is already being used to model those processes. When you think about mechanical recycling and chemical recycling, our technologies are being used in those cases as well. When you think about a hydrogen economy, we are being asked by one of our customers that are thinking about building an entire hydrogen supply chain to work with them and what that would mean. Some of these [oil] (Ph) companies that have announced net zero carbon emission targets are asking us to participate in advisory panels, external advisory panels to help them understand what are those technologies that will contribute to, not only continue to produce the amount of energy that will be required to sustain and improve the standard of living of the world population over the next 20, 30 years, but do that in a sustainable manner, producing less emissions and so on. So what are we doing internally? Look, as we have a lot already implied, and based on our history, we actually think that Hybrid models will play an increasing role in sustainability because we will be able to model reactions that are hard to model using first principle, and a lot of that has to do with sustainability. So look, we are building - so having said all that, just like we did with our capabilities around data science and chemo metricians and so on over the last five years, we are now starting to put together teams that will be exclusively focused on sustainability technologies. Because there is certainly a lot more than we can do. And you will hear more from us during the Investor Day about these. Look, we are very encouraged by what we are hearing from our customers in this whole area of sustainability and how it is been accelerated and the role that they expect us to play as well.\nMark Schappel: Great, thank you. That is all from me.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Blake Gendron with Wolf Research. Your line is now open.\nBlake Gendron: Hey thanks for the time this evening. I want to circle back on APM. And not to pile on here, but trying to get an understanding of the customers that are in trial with APM right now, how many are existing MSC customers and some of the larger customers in your core end markets versus potentially new customers and in new markets for you? I guess I'm just trying to understand how much of the cash conservatism are users of MSC that just don't want to maybe spend on APM at this time versus I would imagine some logistical hurdles getting into the facilities with COVID or is there something competitively that we should be aware of? Are you waiting for opportunities to maybe displace a competitor in some of these APM opportunities?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, look historically, we have said that about 10%, 15%, really about 15% of our total pipeline is outside of our core industries, the process industries, into mining, into pharma, into other industries. That is probably gone up a little bit over the last four quarters as we focus more on pharmaceuticals and mining. But I still call it in that 15% range. Look, we had a solid quarter and a solid first half of the year in pharmaceuticals and mining, and really, it is a reflection of our performance with APM in those areas. So we see the difference in decision-making between the industries. And look, it is what leads us to believe that this is something temporary. But we are also - we look at this is now two quarters in a row with this story. We were hoping for a better quarter in December. We thought we were going to have it, didn't materialize at the end. But customers continue to ask to do pilots and prove the value. So I think we are building up a significant pent-up demand that should materialize.\nBlake Gendron: No doubt. Yes, it is a challenging environment for sure. In terms of the free cash flow guide, encouraging on the profitability front. It sounds like in this subdued annual spend growth environment that you are able to streamline cost a little bit and take some cost out. I'm just wondering how we should think about cost add back as sales efforts normalize and you are able to do business travel, should we think about it as cash conversion versus annual spend or as a percentage of annual spend growth with respect to cost add back?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, let me look - certainly, some of the expense benefit that we have seen are, of course, travel and entertainment, sort of in-person marketing events and those are the two main areas. Now fiscal - look, everyone has a point of view about what is going to happen here over the next 11 months now and when people will start traveling and so on. Considering the fact that our fiscal years cross over calendar years, we think that even if we start traveling and we start doing in-person events, that will probably only start impacting fiscal year 2022 and possibly only half of fiscal year 2022. So that add back on expenses will not be as pronounced as perhaps for other companies that operate on a calendar fiscal year. But look, let's just say that are disciplined in this company around expenses and delivering profitability will continue to come through even as we transition back to a normal economy. Let me just say that.\nBlake Gendron: That makes sense. I appreciate the time. thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Antonio Pietri for closing remarks.\nAntonio Pietri: Well, look, I want to thank everyone for joining this evening's call. I look forward to talking to some of you, all of you as the quarter progresses here and hopefully get to start having some in-person meetings in the future. Thank you, everyone. Have a good evening.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Antonio Pietri",
            "content": "Thank you, Karl. And thank you all for joining us today. We hope all of you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. Let's start by looking quickly at our financial results for the second quarter. Revenue was $233.7 million, supported by the largest dollar amount of quarterly renewals in the fiscal year. GAAP EPS was $1.89, and non-GAAP EPS was $2.04. Annual spend was $604 million, up 1.3% in the quarter and 7% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $38 million. AspenTech's performance in the second quarter was solid given the current economic environment, and we remain on track to deliver a good year of growth in fiscal 2021. We continue to be confident in our ability to return to double-digit annual spend growth once economic conditions normalize. In the second quarter, we are particularly pleased with our renewals performance in what was the largest renewals quarter in our history. Our customers continue to make substantial long-term commitments to AspenTech in a clear demonstration of our technologies' strategic importance to their operations. One of the highlights of the quarter was signing one of our biggest ever licensed bookings transaction, a renewal for more than $75 million with one of the largest global oil companies. From a growth perspective, our engineering and MSC Suites delivered growth in line with our expectations, and the APM Suite came in below plan. While our conversations with customers throughout the quarter were positive, we saw certain customers take a more conservative outlook on spending in late December that we believe was due in part to the recent wave of COVID-related restrictions in many parts of the world. Overall, demand activity across our portfolio remains strong. We are engaged in strategic conversations with customers in all our target markets to expand our investments in AspenTech solutions to achieve critical business needs and enable their assets to run safer, greener, longer and faster. In fact, our demand generation and top of sales funnel business activity are performing at levels similar to what we experienced prior to the onset of COVID. We believe this is a positive indication about the opportunity for strong growth in the second half of fiscal 2021 and beyond. Based on our first half performance and current outlook for the second half of the year, we are tightening the range for annual spend growth to6% to 8% compared to our previous range of 6% to 9%. As we laid out at the beginning of the fiscal year, we faced a higher degree of uncertainty in fiscal 2021 and a wider-than-normal range of potential outcomes. The underlying assumptions in our updated guidance include: APM will contribute 1.25 points of growth, down from two points; attrition in the upper half of the 5% to 6% range we provided at the beginning of the year. It is important to note that we have already incurred a significant portion of our expected annual attrition in the first half of the year, given the timing of renewals so we expect attrition will have less impact on annual spend growth in the second half of the year. We expect similar growth expectations for our Engineering and MSC Suites. From a profitability perspective, we are increasing our free cash flow guidance to $265 million to $275 million, supported by strong collections and lower expenses. I would like to spend a few minutes providing an update on trends in each of our core markets. Chemicals continued to show good resilience and was the best performance vertical for AspenTech in the quarter. Overall, we have seen a slow and steady improvement in the chemicals market, with the segments benefiting from the current economic environment more than offsetting the parts of the industry that are facing challenges. As we have discussed in the past, digitalization is a top strategic priority and consistent area of investment for chemical companies. Increasingly, this industry recognizes that it must operate in a more efficient and environmentally sustainable manner in order to remain competitive and viable in the long term. AspenTech solutions are mission-critical in achieving these objectives, which gives us confidence we will continue to generate consistent growth in this market. To that end, we recently joined the Alliance to End Plastic Waste as an enabler company contributing capital, technology and expert resources. The AEPW organization is a global-nonprofit focused on building a more sustainable plastic value chain to achieve its mission of ending plastic waste in the environment. An example of the continued focus by chemical customers on digitalization and sustainability is the transaction signed with a North American chemical customer looking to maximize production and efficiency through optimal asset performance. After working with their digitalization group to evaluate our technologies, they selected Aspen ProMV to deliver more consistent quality, less waste, longer uptime and maintenance spend reduction, generating millions of dollars in annual benefits. The refining business for oil and gas companies and the independent refiners continues to face a challenging business environment related to changes in travel patterns due to COVID. The reduced demand for gasoline and jet fuel has had a pronounced impact on demand, resulting in operating rates below their historical levels. Refining margins have improved recently from the lows experienced in the middle of calendar 2020, but are still below their historical trend. We continue to have positive conversations with our refining customers, which remain committed to investing in digitalization technologies from AspenTech that will enable more efficient, agile and flexible asset operations in the future. We signed a number of transactions in the quarter with refinery operators that expand usage of our products and solutions across the different regions of the world for both our engineering and MSC suites. We are also encouraged by a growing trend we are seeing where MSC products and best practices continue to migrate from refining to the midstream and upstream businesses of our customers. For example, a South American customer that is an important user of our Aspen PIMS-AO solution for refinery planning optimization identified significant benefits from deploying an enterprise-wide planning optimization solution that extends from their refining assets to their upstream and midstream businesses to optimize the production and supply of crude oil in their operations. This enterprise planning optimization solution represents millions of dollars in incremental value capture in their logistics operations. A second example is a Europe-based integrated oil company that is extending the use of Aspen DMC3 and Aspen digital solutions to their upstream facilities. This customer has a decarbonization strategy to reduce CO2 emissions in line with the United Nations 2030 objectives. We worked with the customer in its main European upstream and midstream facilities to demonstrate how advanced process control could help decrease production costs as well as CO2 emissions. The pilot demonstrated a 15% reduction in CO2 emissions. As a result, the customer decided to roll out Aspen DMC3 and Aspen GDOT across the full site. A unique aspect of this pilot project was a remote deployment of our advanced control technology due to COVID restrictions. Turning to the E&C market. Our performance was as expected in the second quarter and first half of the year. Attrition levels have been in line with the range of expectations as these customers right size their agreements to reflect the current CapEx reality. We have a multi-decade history in the E&C market have a very good understanding of its industry dynamics and how demand trends typically play out through economic cycles. We are confident in our ability to manage through the current environment while also being focused on emerging areas like third-party operations and maintenance services for brownfield assets. In the APM area, the suite contributed 0.3 points of growth to annual spend through the first half of the year, which is behind where we expected to be at this point in the year. The Aspen ProMV product in the suite continues to increase its contribution to growth. As mentioned earlier, the challenging market backdrop for our customers and their focus on cash conservation has impacted our ability to close Aspen Mtell transactions and outweighed growing customer interest. We remain confident this is a near-term dynamic based on our customer conversations and pilot completions and a significant value and success existing customers are having with their APM deployments. We continue to have a strong APM pipeline that includes a record number of in-flight or completed Aspen Mtell pilots. These pilots have successfully demonstrated the value of the product to prospective customers and gives us confidence growth will improve as the macro environment normalizes. We have also been cataloging successes from the Aspen installed base that demonstrate the tremendous value we can deliver to customers across a range of reliability improvement use cases. We refer to these as catches, potential failures avoided by alerting from Aspen Mtell. For example, Aspen Mtell alerted with 30 days notice the potential rupture of a pipe in a recovery boiler of a pulp and paper mill that could have led to the complete shutdown of it, avoiding upwards of $10 million in losses. Similarly, Aspen Mtell identified a failure in the cooling oil pipes of the compressor section of a hyper compressor in a polypropylene plant, avoiding $150,000 in costs in that one instance. Two months after the deployment of Mtell, the customers has increased plant availability by 35% and reduced downtime periods by 45%, representing avoidance of a significant number of failures. We now have an extensive library of examples where Aspen Mtell is improving reliability and capturing huge value. For some customers, like an LNG producer in South America, the potential value creation from deploying Aspen Mtell was so compelling, it skipped the pilot altogether and put the technology directly in production. The customer understood the differentiating factors and technical advantages of our solution and how we could meet its needs to improve asset reliability, reduce maintenance costs and increase natural gas production. This customer is targeting a 2% improvement in asset availability, which represents millions of dollars annually in additional production. As we look to the second half of the year and beyond, we are as confident as ever in our ability to generate consistent double-digit annual spend growth over time. This confidence is driven not only by the expected benefits of better future economic conditions, but also the multiple significant product announcements we have made in recent months. As we have discussed on our business update call in November, AspenTech's strategy is to be the industrial AI company, by leveraging the strength of our core capabilities in engineering First principles with artificial intelligence capabilities to dramatically increase the value we can deliver to customers and use the AIoT Hub as the environment to deliver that value. The recently launched AIoT Hub is generating great feedback from customers and is quickly building pipeline. During the quarter, we signed our first wins with this solution in the Energy & Chemicals verticals. As a reminder, the IT hub is our cloud-ready architecture that supports the ability to collect vastly more data than ever before to support our new generation of high-value hybrid applications. It also provides important new visualization capabilities and provides an environment for data scientists to leverage machine learning to build their own AI applications within the IoT hub. We are also very pleased with the early feedback we have received on our recent aspenONE v12 release. In particular, we are seeing great customer interest in hybrid models, which combine data collection from the enterprise with artificial intelligence and AspenTech's 40-years of domain expertise and strength in engineering first principles modeling to create the first and most accurate set of hybrid models for the process industries. With v12 and Aspen Hybrid models, we are able to solve very complex problems faster and more accurately than ever before. One example of customer enthusiasm for B v12 was a renewal with increased annual spend commitments by one of our largest E&C customers based in Europe. This customer quickly realizes the potential value from using the hybrid model in a multi case capabilities now available in the v12 Engineering suite. Another important part of our growth strategy is building upon our success in the global economy industries to further diversify our business in this vertical. We had a solid first half of the year in mining and pharmaceuticals, and see significant opportunities for future growth in this market. We recently hired David Lita to a new role in the company as Senior Vice President and General Manager of our Pharmaceuticals business. David is a 25-year pharma industry veteran, including most recently, 18-years at Thermo Fisher Scientific. Where he led a team that generated consistent double-digit software revenue growth. In this new role, baby David will be responsible for shaping AspenTech's product and solutions strategy for the pharma market and leading our go-to-market efforts. We believe the pharma industry is undergoing the structural changes that make it an increasingly attractive market for current and future AspenTech solutions. During the quarter, we made a small but strategically important acquisition targeted at the pharma market. Camo Analytics has developed highly sophisticated technology that applies analytical science to address process and product quality challenges that enable customers to meet compliance requirements while reducing waste. The addition of Camo will strengthen our analytics capabilities and better enable users to analyze large and complex data sets quickly, easily and accurately. At our upcoming Investor Day on Friday, February 12, we will provide an in-depth update on our v12 release, new product innovation and long-term growth strategy, including our point of view on the tailwind that sustainability and digitalization will play in our future. As companies in our core and GI industries manage their transition to lower emission operations and less plastic waste, we believe we will be uniquely positioned to support them. We are very proud of the investments we have made to increase the value AspenTech can deliver for our customers, and we look forward to explaining them in more detail to the investment community in a few weeks. As we have made meaningful investments in our product portfolio and go-to-market efforts, we also continue to generate high levels of profitability and free cash flow. In the second quarter, we generated $38 million of free cash flow, driven by better-than-expected collections, disciplined expense management and COVID-related savings. From a capital allocation perspective, we did not repurchase any shares during the first half of the fiscal year. It is our intention to meet our original goal for the year and repurchase up to $200 million of stock in the second half of fiscal 2020, given business and market conditions. As a reminder, we allocate our capital based on driving shareholder value. Our strong balance sheet and cash generation are competitive advantages for AspenTech that allows us to invest in the business during periods of uncertainty when many of our competitors cannot. We have demonstrated this through prior economic downturns, and we intend to do so again with investments in the AIoT hub, aspen One v12Bele and expanding our capabilities in pharma that I referenced earlier. Our disciplined capital allocation strategy has a demonstrated track record of producing attractive return for shareholders in multiple ways. Before I turn the call over to Karl, I would like to end by emphasizing the enduring strength of our business in the midst of the most significant economic contraction in our lifetimes. AspenTech remains on pace to deliver mid- to high single-digit annual spend and double-digit free cash flow per share growth in fiscal 2021. We believe this reinforces the unique qualities of AspenTech that we have highlighted to investors for years. The combination of mission critical products, deep and long-term customer relationships and a continued focus on operational excellence. We remain focused on supporting our customers and executing in our strategic priorities. We are incredibly excited about the opportunities ahead for AspenTech, and are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable double-digit growth once economic conditions normalize. Now let me turn the call over to Karl. Karl. Okay. Well, I mean, look, certainly, the refining industry is very focused on managing their cash flows, considering the macro that they have been facing. Certainly, upstream is another area. Chemicals, while we had a solid quarter, we have also had a little bit of a pullback in chemicals. But at the same time, look, we signed deals outside of our core industries in mining, and a couple of other industries as well, pharmaceuticals actually as well. So we think this is temporary. And in the quarter, while it wasn't a record quarter for a number of pilots, it was the second largest quarter of pilots we have done just behind the Q1 quarter. And we are projecting that Q3 will probably be a record quarter again for a number of pilots. So we remain confident. It is just that we are seeing a conservative approach from some customers with regards to spending. Yes. No, look, first of all, 12 to 18 months, 24 months before any renewal, we are already engaged with that customer, making sure that not only are they using the entitlement that they have, but that we can also drive up entitlement. This is one of the largest oil companies in the world. It is our largest license bookings transaction ever. A lot goes into doing a renewal like that. But we highlighted, just to give you all a sense for the magnitude of the business that we have with our customers, the volume of business that we were renewing in Q2, and certainly, how relevant our technologies continue to be to these companies that are managing through a very difficult macro environment, but also are focusing on energy transition, sustainability and how they can leverage our solutions going forward. So we are very happy with the outcome of that renewal. And actually, in the out years of that contract, it gets even more interesting. So just signaling that despite the macro environment, there are significant business happening for us as well. Thank you. Well, I mean, look, our pipeline of business has remained flat basically through Q1 and Q2. It hasn't gone up, it hasn't gone down. But the volume of that pipeline that is related to in-flight pilots or completed pilots has increased. And the only thing that I would say about Q1 and Q2 FY 2021 is a couple of quarters that are impacted by the pandemic as opposed to Q1 and Q2 2020. Our Q3 and Q4 quarters in 2020 were impacted by the pandemic, but not Q1 and Q2. So I think the comp is a little bit different. And now we have seen the impact of basically the macro in 2020. So that is what I can say about that. Thank you. Yes. Well, look, I think what we said, attrition is tracking to our expectation for the first half of the year. Now we have perfect visibility into the dollar amount of renewals in the first half of the year and the size of the Q2 quarter renewals on a dollar basis. So our assumptions for attrition in the first half correlated to that volume of business. Now we have also said that our engineering and MSC business perform according to expectations, and APM is down. And then the last thing I will say, Jason, is that, again, our overall performance in Q1 and Q2 of 2021 has the impact of the pandemic and oil prices and all of that, while Q1 and Q2 2020 were not impacted by the pandemic. So the comp is very different. No, look, we had a - let me make sure I use the right word, a solid quarter of duration in renewal. So we saw no impact whatsoever. Okay. Great. Great. Thanks. Yes. I mean, look, again, I think it has to do with the fact that this new technology, Matt, and it is probably seen as discretionary spending. The fact is that these organizations have maintenance processes in place, and they continue to execute to those. Our engineering and MSC solutions have a long history of creating value, and we continue to see the spend in that area. In APM we have come to the end of quarters and customers have pulled back. I do think we were I mean somewhat unlucky in that towards December, we all started to hear a lot about the increasing cases of COVID and lockdowns and perhaps a deteriorating economic environment and perhaps is what happened in the last two weeks of the quarter for us with some of the transactions that did not close. But look, on the other hand, the fact that throughout the quarter, we continue to execute a high level of pilot. We expect to have a record number of pilots completed in the Q3 quarter also signals to us that there is a lot of interest in the technology and what it can do. And so certainly, we have this sort of dichotomy between a number of pilots being executed and business that is closing. And this, in a way, encourages us in that this is probably a temporary issue. And once the macro environment gets back to a more normal environment, we will start to see some of this pent-up demand that we see in our pipeline. Yes. We are standing up. We have been standing up as sales organization in pharma now for a couple of quarters. That is one of the investments that we targeted at the beginning of the fiscal year. We have also made some decisions running additional investments to incorporate pharma - additional pharma-specific capabilities in some of the products that are relevant for the pharma industry. So those are investments that will start to happen this quarter under the guidance and oversight of David. Camo Analytics is certainly an acquisition that we - brings an installed base, and we are excited about. But ultimately, we have always said that in any industry that we operate in, we want to be number one or number two in the segments, the product segments or solutions segment that we are in. And in the case of pharma, if we find the right acquisition and I won't go into what we mean by that, I have explained that to investors all the time. We would be open to that, but we have our criteria around best-in-class profitability and double-digit growth, and that is the lens that we look at anything through, including in pharma. Look, metals and mining is another industry that we believe it is interesting as well. I think there is an opportunity to create value. We are creating a significant value in already metals and mining for some customers with our APM solution. I think the AIoT Hub and our data historian could play a big role in that industry as well. But there is also a whole software ecosystem in metals and mining that is also attractive. And beyond that, look, you have put and beverage and other industries. Thank you Matt. Yes. Well, look, what I can say about the historical origins, if you will, of that contract and our relationship with that customer, first of all, it is a relationship that goes back a very long time. This is a customer that this contract has the standard duration that we talk about five to six years. And over that period, when we first signed that renewal, there is been a continuous uptake of technology by that customer and standardization on our solutions across their entire operational ecosystem in refining; in some cases, in upstream; in some cases, in chemicals as well. So the contract has increased significantly since the last renewal. And our expectation is that, that relationship will also continue to grow in the future as they take up some of our new solutions and incorporate hybrid modeling capabilities, the Aspen GDOT product and the new generation of solutions that we are introducing into the market. But very encouraged by that transaction in the midst of everything that is been going on last year. Well, I mean, I think, Gal, first of all, I invite you all to attend our Investor Day because we will talk about our growth drivers going forward and how we see some of these major trends around sustainability and digitalization supporting our business going forward. So I will say that first. Well, look, in a way, you just have to look at the last five years and the trough in 2017 around sort of low to mid single-digit growth, the level of attrition, how attrition and the glide path of attrition over the following three, four years. You could see that between 2018 and 2019 fiscal, our growth rate jumped from 6.4 to 10.6. So I do believe, and recent history tells us that these periods of macro disruption do hold back spending by our customers. And once the macro normalizes budgets normalize and there is pent-up demand that gets released into better spending on our technologies, so going from 6.4 grow to 10.6. I mean that is a big jump in one year. So I will tell you, Aspen Technology today is not the same company that was five years ago. And I will guarantee you that Aspen Technology will not be the same company in three years and five years than it is today. We have put towards significant investments and including introducing a new generation of capabilities that did not exist up until early October when we released them. And we are going to be releasing a lot more of those capabilities. The AIoT Hub was introduced late at the beginning of Q2 fiscal. Our investments in pharma are new as well. So my expectation and the expectation of everyone in the company is that over the next three to five years, the organization will be transformed again. And furthermore, our technologies, in general, will be very relevant during this energy transition and transition in the chemical industries into a circular economy and plastic waste elimination. So we will talk about all of these during Investor Day, but we are very encouraged by what we are seeing from our customers. The involvement that they expect from AspenTech in this transition that they are planning and are experiencing. And also the role that we have played over 35, 39 years now in reducing emissions through better efficiencies, reducing waste through better optimization. And in general, contributing to what, over the last 35 years, is being considered efficiency to drive profitability. And today is consider efficiencies to drive reductions in emissions, which also equates to better profitability. So I'm very encouraged by our future, and we just have to manage through this rough patch in the macro environment and then come out on the other side with all guns blazing, figurative speech. Thank you. great. Well, look. So first of all, a lot of what we do today is our technologies can be leveraged to model, well, starting with research new types of compounds and products that are more sustainable, more degradable, better recyclable. And with that, then you have to research and design the process technologies that go into a design and then are built to produce these new compounds at scale. When you think about carbon capture use and sequestration, our technology is already being used to model those processes. When you think about mechanical recycling and chemical recycling, our technologies are being used in those cases as well. When you think about a hydrogen economy, we are being asked by one of our customers that are thinking about building an entire hydrogen supply chain to work with them and what that would mean. Some of these [oil] (Ph) companies that have announced net zero carbon emission targets are asking us to participate in advisory panels, external advisory panels to help them understand what are those technologies that will contribute to, not only continue to produce the amount of energy that will be required to sustain and improve the standard of living of the world population over the next 20, 30 years, but do that in a sustainable manner, producing less emissions and so on. So what are we doing internally? Look, as we have a lot already implied, and based on our history, we actually think that Hybrid models will play an increasing role in sustainability because we will be able to model reactions that are hard to model using first principle, and a lot of that has to do with sustainability. So look, we are building - so having said all that, just like we did with our capabilities around data science and chemo metricians and so on over the last five years, we are now starting to put together teams that will be exclusively focused on sustainability technologies. Because there is certainly a lot more than we can do. And you will hear more from us during the Investor Day about these. Look, we are very encouraged by what we are hearing from our customers in this whole area of sustainability and how it is been accelerated and the role that they expect us to play as well. Thank you. Yes. Well, look historically, we have said that about 10%, 15%, really about 15% of our total pipeline is outside of our core industries, the process industries, into mining, into pharma, into other industries. That is probably gone up a little bit over the last four quarters as we focus more on pharmaceuticals and mining. But I still call it in that 15% range. Look, we had a solid quarter and a solid first half of the year in pharmaceuticals and mining, and really, it is a reflection of our performance with APM in those areas. So we see the difference in decision-making between the industries. And look, it is what leads us to believe that this is something temporary. But we are also - we look at this is now two quarters in a row with this story. We were hoping for a better quarter in December. We thought we were going to have it, didn't materialize at the end. But customers continue to ask to do pilots and prove the value. So I think we are building up a significant pent-up demand that should materialize. Well, let me look - certainly, some of the expense benefit that we have seen are, of course, travel and entertainment, sort of in-person marketing events and those are the two main areas. Now fiscal - look, everyone has a point of view about what is going to happen here over the next 11 months now and when people will start traveling and so on. Considering the fact that our fiscal years cross over calendar years, we think that even if we start traveling and we start doing in-person events, that will probably only start impacting fiscal year 2022 and possibly only half of fiscal year 2022. So that add back on expenses will not be as pronounced as perhaps for other companies that operate on a calendar fiscal year. But look, let's just say that are disciplined in this company around expenses and delivering profitability will continue to come through even as we transition back to a normal economy. Let me just say that. Thank you. Well, look, I want to thank everyone for joining this evening's call. I look forward to talking to some of you, all of you as the quarter progresses here and hopefully get to start having some in-person meetings in the future. Thank you, everyone. Have a good evening."

            "name": "Karl Johnsen",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2021 ending December 31, 2020. I'm Karl Johnsen, CFO of AspenTech, and with me on the call is Antonio Pietri, President and CEO. Before we begin, I will make the safe harbor statement that during the course of this call, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results may differ materially from such projections or statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's call and contained in our most recently filed Form 10-Q. Also, please note that the following information relates to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, January 27, 2021. Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. The structure of today's call will be as follows: Antonio will discuss business highlights from the second quarter, and then I will review our financial results and discuss our updated guidance for fiscal year 2021. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio. Thanks, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the second quarter fiscal 2021. As a reminder, these results are being reported under topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings, and more specifically, renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years. And this nonlinearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods. In our view, annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business. And annual free cash flow the most important metric for assessing the overall value our business generates. Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for our term license agreements at the end of each period, was approximately $604 million at the end of the second quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 7% on a year-over-year basis and 1.3% sequentially. Total bookings, which we define as the total value of customer term license contracts signed in the current period, was the value of term license contracts signed in the current period but were the initial licenses are not yet deemed delivered under topic 606, plus term license contracts signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period, was $274.4 million, a 144% increase year-over-year. The growth in bookings was heavily influenced by the timing of renewals, including the large renewal with an energy customer that Antonio referenced earlier. Total revenue was $233.7 million for the second quarter, an 85% increase from the prior year period. The year-over-year increase in revenue was the result of the increase in total bookings discussed above. Turning to profitability, beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $70 million compared to $67.5 million in the year-ago period. Total expenses, including cost of revenue, were $84.3 million, which was up from $83.1 million in the year-ago period. Operating income was $149.5 million and net income for the quarter was $129.2 million or $1.89 per share. Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition-related fees, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter of $162.2 million, representing a 69.4% non-GAAP operating margin compared to non-GAAP operating income and margin of $52.1 million and 41.4%, respectively, in the year-ago period. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period-to-period due to the timing of customer renewals and therefore, license revenue recognized during the quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $139.3 million or $2.04 per share-based on 68.4 million shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $217.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $304 million outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we paid down approximately $119.2 million on the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility. In the second quarter, we generated $37.8 million of cash from operations and $38 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and acquisition-related payments. We are pleased with our cash flow performance in the second quarter and the first half of the year, which has benefited from better-than-expected cash collections and reduced expense levels. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is provided in the tables within our press release, which is also available on our website. I would now like to close with guidance. We now expect bookings in the range of $805 million to $850 million, which includes $519 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2021. This includes $122 million of contracts up for renewal in the third quarter. With respect to annual spend growth, as Antonio mentioned, we are now forecasting 6% to 8% annual spend growth. In terms of timing, we would expect the linearity of the sequential growth to be similar to recent years, and that the fourth quarter will have more growth than the third quarter. We now expect revenue in the range of $731 million to $760 million. We expect license revenue in the range of $513 million to $542 million, and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $191 million and $27 million, respectively. From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $356 million to $361 million. Taken together, we expect GAAP operating income in the range of $375 million to $399 million for fiscal 2021, with GAAP net income of approximately $328 million to $347 million. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $4.80 to $5.08. From a non-GAAP perspective, we expect non-GAAP operating income of $418 million to $442 million, and non-GAAP income per share in the range of $5.29 to $5.58. From a free cash flow perspective, as Antonio mentioned, we are taking up our free cash flow guidance to $265 million to $275 million compared to $260 million to $270 million previously. Our fiscal 2021 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments in the range of $60 million to $70 million. To wrap up, our second quarter performance in the context of a challenging environment demonstrates the resilience and scalability of our business. We remain focused on executing on the things we can control and ensuring we are best positioned to benefit from any improvement in economic conditions. With that, Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Yes, it was about $170 million."

At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Aspen Technology Chief Officer; Mr. Karl Johnsen. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nKarl Johnsen: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our selected financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 ending September 30, 2020. I'm Karl Johnsen, CFO of Aspen Tech, and with me on the call is Antonio Pietri, President and CEO. Before we begin, I will make the Safe Harbor statement that during the course of this call. We may make projections or other forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from such projections or statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's call and contained in our most recently filed Form 10-Q. Also, please note that the following information relates to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, November 5, 2020. Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. The structure of today's call will be as follows. Antonio will discuss current business trends, and I will provide an update on completing the filing of our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2020 and our 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 as well as certain balance sheet items. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, Karl, and thank you all for joining us today. We hope all of you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. Given the ongoing process to complete our 10-K filing for fiscal 2020, we will also be delayed in completing our quarterly close process for the first quarter. For that reason today, I will only discuss our annual spend performance in the first quarter and provide an overview of current business trends. And our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year, annual spend at the end of the first quarter is expected to be within a range of $596 million to $597 million, which would represent 8.8% year-over-year growth and 0.6% growth sequentially. This was solid in the context of the macro-environment in what is normally our seasonally lowest growth quarter. Even in this difficult macro-environment. Our customers continue to invest in AspenTech solutions to enhance the operations of their assets and enable them to run safer, greener, longer and faster. We know from previous economic downturns that the mission criticality of our products has been made even more evident to customers, and we believe that it's true today as well. Our annual spend performance in the quarter reflected the anticipated attrition amount for the quarter and in line with the higher level of attrition we expect in fiscal 2021. And gross growth that was largely in line with our performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2020. Customer interest in investing in technologies to realize the benefits of digitalization remains high, and we had encouraging wins across all three of our core verticals. Not surprisingly, we did see a number of customers pause over the summer to regroup and recharge after what has been several extraordinarily stressful month in their operations. Customer engagement and the quality of our conversations around transactions has picked up since Labor Day and especially into October, reminiscent of what we saw in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. Amongst our owner-operator customers, we had a solid quarter in chemicals, where we're seeing a slow and steady improvement. As we mentioned last quarter, the recovery in the chemicals' market is uneven. With the various changes in demand patterns due to the current economic environment being a positive catalyst for parts of the industry and a challenge to others. These customers continue to demonstrate a commitment to their digitalization initiative and a focus on making high ROI investments with AspenTech. We have generated consistent growth for many years amongst these customers and expect that trend to continue. In the energy vertical, we saw good customer activity and interest. The pause I referenced earlier was more pronounced among these customers. But we're optimistic for the balance of the fiscal year based on improving conversations around deals, as just mentioned, and a growing pipeline of opportunities. Similar to what we hear in chemicals, energy customers have made clear that the disruption from the pandemic has reinforced and need to operate their assets with greater agility and flexibility in the future. AspenTech has long been a core enabling technology to meet these goals. And as I will explain in a moment, we are poised to take our value creation to the next level. In the E&C market, as you would expect, these customers are adjusting their operations to the new levels of CapEx spending in their end markets. Positively, we went through a number of renewals in this market during Q1 and they were in line with our expectations. In one case, we had a larger renewal that was signed for a shorter than typical duration, even as these customers annual commitment with AspenTech went up. It's too early to tell if this will become more common with these customers, but this particular renewal will have an impact on the relationship between annual spend, with bookings and revenue when we report our final first quarter results. We continue to see and capture emerging opportunities for growth with these customers as they look to diversify their book of business towards operations and maintenance activities in Brownfield assets. In the quarter, we signed a new agreement with an important North American engineering firm that committed to our Aspen Fidelis and Aspen Mtell products in the APM suite as part of its efforts to grow business in this area. One thing that has become clear in the last eight months is that important global trends, including the focus of our customers and their sustainability efforts have accelerated. This means that for the industries we serve, there's this additional impetus to accelerate deployment of digital technologies to achieve their sustainability targets. The move to net-zero carbon emissions and reduction in plastic waste is being driven by treaties such as the Paris Climate Accord and society's demand for a cleaner environment. Traditionally, the return on investment from our digital technologies has been measured in efficiency and operational gains that translate into profitability. Now we're seeing more customers adopt our solutions to also address sustainability goals and justify the investment on this basis. Digitalization has been in progress for decades in the process and other capital-intensive industries and now next-generation industrial AI capabilities will become critical to addressing climate change and plastic waste in the environment. In fact in a recent survey, we conducted with ARC of global chemical and energy companies. 90% of respondents have sustainability initiatives in place and 75% of respondents rated digital transformation as highly important for achieving sustainability goals. In APM, we continue to be pleased with the level of business activity and our number of active pilots which once again set a record in the first quarter. As we discussed on our last call, we're seeing a number of delayed purchasing decisions with this suite as customers look to hold the line on expenses in the near term. We're confident this is a near-term dynamic and as a positive activity we see in multiple verticals with pipeline creation and active pilots will translate to faster growth as the economy normalizes. To highlight a couple of APM wins from the quarter, a new North American mining customer committed to deploy Aspen Mtell after our successful offline pilot, with the objective to improve the reliability of equipment in their mining operations. Similarly, we saw one of the largest Russian oil companies expand the use of Mtell to one of their largest refineries in the country after the successful rollout at their first refinery. This is part of their digitalization strategy to improve reliability across our operations. Looking forward, we remain confident in our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year, while cognizant of the difficult macro environment that our customers are facing. We had a solid first quarter. And as mentioned, the quality of conversations with our customers around quarter transactions is positive and our pipeline of business continues to grow. We are reiterating our full year annual spend growth target of 6% to 9%, which we have known will be weighted to the back half of the year. We continue to expect attrition to be in line with our guidance of 5% to 6%, and we're also confirming our full year free cash flow target of $260 million to $270 million. From a product perspective, we have recently introduced some of the most important product releases in our history as we deliver on our industrial AI product capabilities and our vision of the self-optimizing plan. We released aspenONE v12, which embeds AI across our product portfolio and uses the capabilities in the Aspen AIoT Hub to deliver enterprise-wide analytics and insights. A key advancement in v12 is the introduction of Aspen Hybrid Models, the first hybrid modeling solution ever introduced in the market. Aspen Hybrid Models captures data from assets across the enterprise and applies artificial intelligence, our historically strong capabilities in engineering first principles modeling and our 40 years of domain expertise to build the first and most comprehensive and accurate hybrid models in the market. With Aspen Hybrid Models, customers are now able to address problems that cannot be solved with engineering principles models alone, build better models faster than ever before and sustain these more accurate models in production longer than before. Aspen hybrid models is a significant achievement that has been incredibly well received by customers. In fact, hybrid model set a record with the most customers participating in our innovation club and beta testing phases. Other exciting innovations in aspenONE V12 include Aspen Multi Case, which allows customers to run thousands of concurrent simulations, either on-prem or in the cloud to allow faster and more accurate decisions to optimize operational complexity. Aspen Master an exciting new capability of DMC3 and Mtell that automates model developed by guiding newer users on how to build a model or agent. Aspen MES Collaborative, which connects data from across all assets, including a small sites where data has historically been stranded and aggregated with our enterprise level historian and Aspen Cloud Connect, which provides flexible and high-performance connectivity and security to transfer data from the edge to the cloud. We also announced the Aspen AIoT Hub, which has received terrific industry and customer feedback since its release in August. We now have the ability to enable seamless and flexible data mobility and integration from sensors to the edge and the cloud, while providing important new visualization capabilities. The AIoT Hub is a core element of our strategy as the industrial AI company. It is our cloud-ready architecture that supports the ability to collect vastly more data than ever before to support our new generation of high-value hybrid applications. It also provides an environment for data scientists to develop AI applications leveraging the machine and algorithms in the data science studio environment of the hub. This is increasingly important as customers data science groups look to contribute to the digitalization efforts of their organizations. aspenONE v12 and the AIoT Hub are only the first step in building out our complete strategy for AspenTech as the industrial AI company. Our future releases will more deeply embed AI into our solutions that further improves the speed, accuracy and quality of models built for assets that run on AspenTech products. AspenTech is democratizing the application of AI to where it can deliver the most value. We believe that Self-Optimizing Plant is key to achieving a digital enterprise and with version 12 and the AIoT Hub who are creating the foundation for that reality for our customers. In short, we're on a journey to reinvent how the process and other capital-intensive industries manage their assets and create significantly greater value. To summarize, we got off to a solid start in fiscal '21. More importantly, we have delivered a tremendous amount of new groundbreaking innovation to the market in recent months. For 40 years, AspenTech has enabled the process industries to operate in ways not previously thought possible. We are confident the new innovations in the AIoT Hub, aspenONE v12 and our broader innovation on hybrid modeling and hybrid products represent the biggest advancement in the process industries in a generation. In the near term, our focus is on supporting our customers and executing through the current economic challenges while continuing to deliver on our innovation vision. We are confident we're laying the foundation for sustainable double-digit growth as the economy normalizes. Now let me turn the call over to Karl. Karl?\nKarl Johnsen: Thanks Antonio. I will provide a quick update on our cash and debt balances and the status of our 10-K and 10-Q filings. We ended the first quarter with $317.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $427.2 million of debt outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility. This is an increase in cash of $29.7 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and reflects $2.7 million of cash taxes and $4 million in principal debt payments on our term loan. Cash collections in the quarter were strong overall and benefited from collections that were originally due in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. During the first quarter, we did not repurchase any shares, though we still intend to repurchase $200 million of our stock in fiscal 2021, depending on market conditions. I'd like to end with a quick update on the status of completing the filing of our fiscal 2020 10-K and 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. In short, nothing has fundamentally changed since September 1 in terms of the issues we are working through to complete our process. As we discussed in our filing on Form 12b-25 on September 1, and as updated by our 8-K filing on September 23, we require additional time to complete our procedures to finalize our fiscal 2020 Form 10-K as a result of additional errors identified in the transition adjustment recorded in prior fiscal years related to the adoption of ASC Topic 606. Based on what is known today, we do not expect these errors to be material. As a reminder, the issues we are working through are the same as those we previously identified last year during our initial work completing the adoption of topic 606 and as part of our fiscal 2019 10-K filings. The delay in filing our fiscal 2020 10-K will impact our ability to file our first quarter fiscal 2021 10-Q on time. Once we file our 10-K, we will move on to completing our Form 10-Q filing, which we anticipate will be done within several weeks after we finalize our Form 10-K. We are working as quickly as we can to complete this process and get current with our SEC filing obligations. As we finalize our filings, we remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities and delivering value for our customers. We believe we are well positioned to deliver on our financial objectives. With that, operator, let's begin the Q&A, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird. Your line is now open.\nRob Oliver: Just one and then a quick follow-up for me. I just wanted to touch on the APM activity. You guys are coming off a very strong Q4. And it sounds like you mentioned that record number of pilots this quarter. You also said there was some - maybe some pause in spending around APM. I was wondering if you could just add a bit of color on that, if there were any particular types of customers that were holding off on that spend. And I know that, that's not necessarily new for you guys. I mean going back to January, there were some deals that were already being kind of delayed. And just wondering if - while you're seeing some deals delayed, you're also seeing some of those that were delayed start to hit.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, I mean, look, Rob, you have to take all of that, that you said in the context of Q1, which is sort of our slowest growth quarter in general, areas like Europe or [indiscernible] location even the U.S. these days, it's becoming more and more. So we didn't necessarily see significant deals that pushed out of the quarter. We just saw a lower level of activity in the quarter. Certainly, in the energy sector, both upstream and refining customers had dealt with a significant amount of disruption in the previous months. And we did see a slowdown in business activity in that sector. Chemicals continue to do well for us, and we saw even some traction with EPC. So I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as you referred to as a Q3 FY '20 issue or before. It just more of a general pause in activity that we saw in the quarter.\nRob Oliver: And then I just wanted to just refer back to the comment you made about the E&C customer with the shorter deal duration. I mean I just wanted to ask on that. Was that a customer that previously had been a kind of 5-, 6-year customer, which would be the norm for you guys in terms of contract? And maybe just a little bit of a thought process around the negotiation on that renewal color there would be helpful.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, let me look at it, no. And I won't talk specifically about what was the original length of that contract and where we ended up with. But in that negotiation, the interesting thing is that this is a customer that ends up going into the negotiation wanting a reduction in spend, and we end up with a transaction that - where the customer is spending more money with AspenTech at the end of the day, albeit a shorter duration contract. So certainly, not what we expected in this current environment. But what I would also say is that we have picked up conversations with that customer since that contract signed, and we'll see what happens in the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nMatt Pfau: So assuming we get a change here in the White House any - I guess, how are you guys thinking about any potential regulation on the energy industry as being either a negative or positive for you?\nAntonio Pietri: No, I mean look, regardless of who is on the White House, if anything, regulations because they enforce a stricter standards on efficiency, especially the quality of gasoline, meaning less sulfur or less emissions or other type of stringent operating constraints, that drives actually a better spend for us because our technologies are about driving more efficiencies, and managing processes to tighter specifications and quality and so on. So in an odd way tighter regulations are more of a positive driver for us.\nMatt Pfau: And then on the GEI segment, I think last quarter, you talked about increasing your sales capacity there. Is that still the plan and have you made any - done any hiring there yet?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, yes no, we are - and today, the pharmaceutical industry, life sciences is in that group. So we were standing up our pharmaceutical sales organization at the moment. We'll also be looking at one or two other industries as well to do that. And - but so yes, we're in the process. We see the opportunities and it will be our organic way to move into other industries, but as we've said in the past. When we look at other industries, we also consider M&A in that regard so that. And Matt, the other thing that I would add to your first question in my prepared remarks, I referred to now the greater focus of our customers on sustainability. And in a way, sustainability targets, net-zero carbon emissions, you could think of them as stricter regulations, less plastic waste in the environment. That means customers have to find a way to produce different types of plastics that can be more easily recyclable or find ways to recover that plastic. While those may not fall on the regulations, it certainly drives customers to consider better operating standards, which is part of this theme of, therefore the need for more of our technology.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gal Munda from Berenberg. Your line is now open.\nGal Munda: The first one is just on the APM. And I was just wondering if you could give - a little bit more clarity in terms of the expectations for the year based on how the first quarter was going to planned out? Are you still expecting about a few percentage distribution to grow similar - kind of in line with what we experienced in FY 2020?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, yes within that range of annual spend growth that we reiterated 6% to 9% growth. In that, we assume two points of growth contribution from APM, and we - still believe we can do that.\nGal Munda: And then I have a question - it's a follow-up question just on the GEI. In the past, you guys have said that verticals such as pharma don't really care that much about the efficiencies and it's kind of a limited opportunity in order to get to them direct. What has changed and can you just talk us a little bit what is different this time or - this time around that kind of makes you that market more attractive?\nAntonio Pietri: Are you talking about pharma specifically?\nGal Munda: Pharma specifically.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, yes.\nGal Munda: Because that's why there is revenue, you said you're already hiring for yes, about yes?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, yes - maybe I know look - correct in a way, efficiencies is not a driver for the pharmaceutical industry at least not - it hasn't been, I think it will become more and more. A lot of pharmaceutical processes are starting to be shifted from batch processing to continues. And in that, we've had conversations with some pharma customers about the implementation of advanced process control. Pharma customers have been some of the early adopters of our Aspen Mtell product around reliability in their manufacturing operations. So that's really also about efficiencies. But really, the main driver for the pharma industry with AspenTech has been really manufacture and execution systems and the tracking and recording of the information and the data as these products are manufactured or produced. But more and more, we're seeing from the pharma industry an interest in analytics and AI capabilities in multivariate analytics. So, we also believe that there's an increasing opportunity in different areas of the pharma sort of supply chain. If you will from R&D on to manufacturing and then distribution to apply sophisticated analytics, including tying that to the tracking and recording of all the information associated with the production of these drugs. So we're excited about this opportunity. We've been in pharma for 20, 25 years. This is not necessarily an area that is new to us, but we just haven't been putting the investment into that area, and we will now, and we're optimistic about it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jackson Ader from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJackson Ader: Can we just start with a couple of procedural questions on the K and Q. What is the current expectation where - when the K will be filed, I guess let's just start with that?\nKarl Johnsen: Yes, I mean - as I said, we got to stay kind of within the four corners of our public documents. But we're moving as fast as we can on that. We expect to file it in the near future, but we're still working through it.\nJackson Ader: And as far as the metrics that were provided tonight, the annual customer spend range and then the cash balance. I mean were you limited in terms of - because of some regulatory type of restrictions? Were you limited just to these couple of metrics or is it just simply the amount of work that's going into the 10-K means you literally are having trouble counting up and closing the books from the September quarter?\nKarl Johnsen: No, it is a little bit of - we weren't prohibited from sharing any numbers statutorily. But - it's a little bit serial in nature for the team that's finalizing the 10-K. What they're doing is it's really just proving out the balance on the contract asset. And that work is very detailed, and it takes a long time to get through. We're working with the auditors. Nothing has materially changed from the initial work we did months ago. It's just a matter of getting the auditors through that. Because of that, it's a balance sheet item, it would roll forward. So, we need to make sure that we get that finalized with the auditors then we can finalize our Q1. We are closing the books on a monthly basis, and we continue to close them. But because we're not - we haven't had the auditors come in and review the quarter because they're still working on the K. It would be difficult to go and let the - put out metrics on the Q and then have them change. So, we are closing the books. We've closed Q1. I do have my point of view of where it is. But before we release, we would have to have the auditors get through that.\nJackson Ader: No fun, but at least I just wanted to get those questions asked. Quickly, Antonio, can you remind us, just given all the discussion about the record number of pilots. Can you just remind us what a typical pilot looks like in terms of the use case, length of time? Are you allowing customers as they go in this kind of spending pause to just keep kind of renewing or rolling pilots forward? And then what does the spend on a pilot look like relative to what you would consider a full deployment or a full license?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. I mean look, we've become also much more efficient at doing pilots from 2, 3 years ago. We set up this team in Latin America that is sort of cloud-enabled and are involved in developing the agents and identifying the failure signatures from all these data. So we've gained tremendous efficiencies on sort of loading up tons of data into data lakes that then this team can just crank through so our pilots, originally, it would take us 6 to 8 weeks. We've cut them down to maybe a month. It also depends on how quickly customers get organized and can support us, but it's not a lengthy process. Look, once we got pilots, we're done, we don't sort of linger on with pilots. There's a few instances where customers, as part of their evaluation, do require what we call an online pilot that may go on for months, but that's a very, very small fraction of all the pilots we do, and we have very strict criteria around that type of pilot, especially commitment to a transaction when it is completed because sometimes they go for 6, 9, 12 months. But that's a very small fraction of all pilots. Normally, pilots get done very quickly. The use cases are normally use cases that are identified by customers because they know the equipment that is failing in their plants. And then we go and define the envelope that we want to look at envelope of data, all the instruments. And then we go about and do what we normally do. We've also historically asked customers to make a financial commitment to do a pilot because we didn't want pilots to turn into a science exercises, especially 2, 3 years ago when most customers were just trying to learn about AI and this technology. So we have sort of those gates, and we're pretty rigorous in the process. But we also have to now acknowledge the reality of the market. And these customers are under - some of them under severe financial constraints, and so we continue to work on their pilots. We identify the value, the justification is all there. And we sort of leave the bun in the oven, cooking a little longer until they're ready to pull the trigger. But look, there's a sales engagement in that process. We just don't forget about them. So hopefully, I answered everything you were looking for.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew Obin: So, just the question, a lot of companies with exposure to oil and gas this season. We're really stressing the fact that there's going to be a budget reset next year. And that's what really going to restart a lot of activity in the energy sector. What are your conversations like with the customers about sort of the budgeting process and how it's been different from normal? And are you seeing this big reset in January?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, let me look, normally, we work to make sure that our priorities are included in those budgets. And that's part of the ongoing conversations we have with customers, as we look at our pipeline, part of sort of that growing pipeline of business. When we sort of reconfirm our guidance for the year, then we're taking into account, of course, many information, including what we're hearing for customers - from customers about the availability of budget into next calendar year. So it's sort of a fluid process that, in a way, it's coming to an end already started as early as September, early September for some companies. Look, my expectation is that the most important thing about a budgeting process is certainty whether that is certainty at $50 a barrel or certainty at $35, it is certainty. What we saw in the March quarter was huge uncertainty, and therefore, the natural tendency to pull back. Q4, I mean, in the June quarter was a much more stable quarter from oil prices and the stabilization of the macro environment. And therefore, there was more certainty, and we saw that. So I think as long as there's line of sight into and with more certainty into the environment in calendar '21, I think budgets will support, hopefully, a better spending environment. But we're engaged with our customers and our ability to look at our business for the fiscal year also relies on those conversations.\nAndrew Obin: And my follow-up question, a bit more of an open-end question, but how has this, change in the narrative in the energy industry, has changed your customer focus and a fairly open-ended question, but the two areas more focused perhaps on efficiency, more focused on cost in oil and gas industry. And the second thing, maybe any change in attitude for putting the data in the cloud and maybe accelerating technology shift?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. No, look, so what I would say is digitalization front and center. Back in June, we had our call with our Executive Advisory Board, and they all felt and confirmed that, yes, OpEx and CapEx budgets were being cut, but digitalization budgets were staying. And we saw that in our June quarter. I do think in the last few months, sustainability has become a much bigger theme. If you think July, August, even September, some of the European oil companies came out and announced their commitment to net 0 carbon emissions by, I don't know, you pick the day, 2040, 2050, and that has now made investments on achieving these sustainability targets, also a priority. We absolutely saw decisions being made in Europe around our technologies purely on the basis of contributing to reductions in emissions as a result of greater efficiencies and the justification being okay, this will help us achieve our net 0 carbon emission targets, let's then allocate the budget to it. So we foresee a greater theme and justification for what AspenTech delivers to our customers on the basis of sustainability. So in my opinion, our opinion, both, I think, digitalization and sustainability will be strong drivers of investment on what we do in the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.\nJason Celino: One question for me. The Self-Optimizing Plant opportunity, Antonio, can you walk us through a customer example, maybe in refining what that process looks today and maybe what the Self-Optimizing Change could look like?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Yes, look, and certainly, when we do our Investor Day, you guys will get the full explanation on this, so I'll try to only use a minute or so here. But look, certainly, the Self-Optimizing Plant vision is an ambitious endeavor. The idea that most processes in our - in these very complex and dangerous to operate assets will become autonomous is, in a way, the holy grail of the process industries. We believe that through the breadth and depth of technologies that we have and we have accumulated over the last 20 years, the installed base of those technologies in the market and now the leveraging of this new industry 4.0 capabilities artificial intelligence, cloud, high-performance computing, edge connectivity, all these things make the possibility of delivering autonomous processes and the Self-Optimizing Plant a real reality or possibility, if you will. So we've set ourselves a time line, I'd like to think it's an ambitious time line. And the first step in - the first building block of the Self-Optimizing Plant was released in August when we announced or early September when we announced the release of Aspen Unified, which will be the core capability around an autonomous production optimization component of the Self-Optimizing Plant. The v12 release in early October, is basically a new set of components with this hybrid modeling capabilities where you now see the introduction of machine learning, deep learning capabilities into our products to really drive a highly - much more higher monitoring of these assets on a real-time basis, where we will be able to put hybrid models online to consume data, real-time coming out of these assets and monitor for every possible parameter on this asset, whether it's process parameters, temperatures, pressures, whether it's performance parameters, around quality, density or color of these products emissions, anything. So we also believe that we can - with that capability, we're going to create an autonomous performance engineering process where - where now we can begin to automate the full engineering process around these assets and put a lot of those capabilities online. That will feed into an autonomous production optimization component and then they are an autonomous reliability component and eventually, how the supply chain fits into these assets to drive the operations. So it's an ambitious endeavor, but one that we believe we're uniquely positioned to deliver because of the breadth and depth of our technologies. And really, the growth in our capabilities around industry 4.0 technologies over the last 4 years. It's a very exciting area for us. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the hybrid modeling innovation club and beta testing phase broke all records by a long shot for those type of clubs in the history of the company. Great excitement with our customers about these capabilities. This is the first time ever that you have technology in the market that blends first principles, engineering first principles, modeling capabilities with AI modeling capabilities to create a type of product that not only embed artificial intelligence, but they are safe to deploy in this very complex assets. So, sorry for the long answer, but it's a very exciting area, and there's a lot happening there. The AIoT Hub is basically the delivery vehicle that we put in place to scale the deployment of these hybrid models across an asset and across the enterprise and that's a key component as well. There's a data science studio there with a library of data science algorithms, AI algorithms that this group of data scientists in these companies can now go on to and use to create their own custom applications and use that architecture to deploy their own solutions. So all very exciting stuff, and you'll hear more and more from us in this regard. Because there will be periodic releases of these capabilities over the next many years as we embed more and more of AI capabilities in our existing products. So, we're not having to create new products, we're just enhancing our products with these capabilities. And in that, we'll be able to monetize the higher value that will be created from the deployment of these capabilities and eventually from the delivery of the Self-Optimizing Plant.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Blake Gendron from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nBlake Gendron: Yes thanks. I wanted to follow-up on hybrid models.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi Blake.\nBlake Gendron: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Want to follow-up on hybrid models, really appreciate all the detail that you just gave and understand that we're going to get a lot more detail on the Analyst Day. You did mention that this was one of the bigger developments in some time. So I'm just wondering if there was a way to frame maybe the incremental value-add versus the current offering? Like if you're current offering adds ex amount of value, is there a multiple of that, that these hybrid models would encompass? And then also, how would you maybe go-to-market with this and price this in the case that this technology might result in fewer people or tokens at your customers' facility. I'm just wondering, technological advancement versus maybe cannibalization of number of users?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes well, I mean look, the goal is never to eliminate people and I'll go back to 30, 35 years ago with multivariable process control. The initial fear by operators was that we're going to eliminate their jobs. And the fact is that the jobs of those operators change. They became supervisors of the technology when we closed the loop on the control of these very dangerous processes. So the goal is never to eliminate people. In our opinion, as we deploy these capabilities, the jobs of all these engineers will change. And they'll dedicate themselves to higher level tasks and higher productivity tasks. But look, having said that, it's like everything, you can use a bicycle and go from city A to city B, and it may take you 10 hours. But if you build a car and you have that car well, it will take you maybe only 30 minutes to go from city A to city B. But because now, the car becomes more popular, instead of only one person taking that ride from city A to city B, now you have hundreds or thousands of those people making that trip. So similarly, in this case, as we're able to deploy these capabilities online and automate the capture and processing of this data and the creation of the insights. We believe that more and more of this technology will be deployed 24/7, which will lock-in the consumption of the tokens like APC does or optimization does. And therefore, there will be much greater consumption of token and technology as a result of all of this. The value that it will create will be greater, and this is something that we'll talk to investors during Analyst Day. But that value is certainly the outcome of greater accuracy in the models, greater ability to predict more accurately the outcomes that are expected. And the value will vary from area-to-area and application-to-application. But look, we say we've always been about innovation, but really, we've always been about innovation that creates greater and greater value. And we've demonstrated that over the last five, 10 years and almost 40 years of the company. And this is the next phase of that journey.\nBlake Gendron: And one more, if I could on the fiscal 2021 guidance, so I understand the annual spend growth is back-half weighted. And I understand the APM contribution as you guys laid it out. Between engineering and MSC, I would imagine more pressure on MSC being just because of the CapEx pressure versus OpEx in the end markets and specifically in oil and gas? So as you see it, which aspects of your guide, do you see more risk or the most risk, both the upside and the downside, is it in a specific suite or is it in a specific end market? I'm just wondering what we should be looking at maybe over the next quarter or two to better frame how the back half improvement in annual spend is going to shape up?\nAntonio Pietri: No, well I mean look, in a way - we were and due some unfortunate set of events over the last eight months in the world, as far as fiscal year 2021. We were fortunate that it started to take place in March, and it was fully baked in by the time we rolled into our fiscal 2021 in July. So, we had a good sense for the dynamics around the different areas of our business with E&Cs, with refiners and chemical producers. So look - as I've said in the past, the low end of our range assumes being at the higher end of the attrition range that we gave and less gross growth, meaning customers decide not to spend as much money. The high end of the range means that we'll be at the lower end of the attrition. And customers - we see the same sort of a spending pattern that we saw in our Q4 quarter fiscal year 2020. And then what is that combination? Well it will depend, but we have an internal point of view on that and I keep it - I'll rather keep it to ourselves. But look we said, we need two points of growth contribution from APM and in that, that means that it's anywhere between four to seven points of contribution from MSC and engineering. And then you have to break that down by verticals. But - and that's the one piece we don't give you guys and because it will vary and it will vary by quarter. So, we'd rather get the full year picture and then see how it came out. But look, I think Aspen Unified, which we released in August, is a driver for business this year. These hybrid modeling capabilities that we released in early October will have an impact on our results this year. The GDOT product that we released now year and a half ago had an impact in our Q1 quarter and will have a bigger impact in the rest of the year. So, we also believe that we've been putting in place new capabilities and technology that will start sort of water-falling into fiscal 2021 in a difficult macro-environment, but we're very happy with the traction for example, we're seeing around our GDOT product. And the thing about GDOT is that drives more implementations DMC3 because it's the base technology that it sits on top of. So there are many - let's just say, there's many ways to skin the cat and - we're confident about how we see it coming together.\nOperator: I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to President and Chief Executive Officer, Antonio Pietri.\nAntonio Pietri: Okay, thank you operator, and we want to thank everyone for joining the call and it was a short notice, about 72 hours. But just know and trust that we're working diligently to be able to release our 10-K and eventually, our 10-Q and get back to a more normal cycle with our filings. Thank you everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Antonio Pietri",
            "content": "Thank you, Karl, and thank you all for joining us today. We hope all of you and your families continue to be safe and healthy. Given the ongoing process to complete our 10-K filing for fiscal 2020, we will also be delayed in completing our quarterly close process for the first quarter. For that reason today, I will only discuss our annual spend performance in the first quarter and provide an overview of current business trends. And our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year, annual spend at the end of the first quarter is expected to be within a range of $596 million to $597 million, which would represent 8.8% year-over-year growth and 0.6% growth sequentially. This was solid in the context of the macro-environment in what is normally our seasonally lowest growth quarter. Even in this difficult macro-environment. Our customers continue to invest in AspenTech solutions to enhance the operations of their assets and enable them to run safer, greener, longer and faster. We know from previous economic downturns that the mission criticality of our products has been made even more evident to customers, and we believe that it's true today as well. Our annual spend performance in the quarter reflected the anticipated attrition amount for the quarter and in line with the higher level of attrition we expect in fiscal 2021. And gross growth that was largely in line with our performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2020. Customer interest in investing in technologies to realize the benefits of digitalization remains high, and we had encouraging wins across all three of our core verticals. Not surprisingly, we did see a number of customers pause over the summer to regroup and recharge after what has been several extraordinarily stressful month in their operations. Customer engagement and the quality of our conversations around transactions has picked up since Labor Day and especially into October, reminiscent of what we saw in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. Amongst our owner-operator customers, we had a solid quarter in chemicals, where we're seeing a slow and steady improvement. As we mentioned last quarter, the recovery in the chemicals' market is uneven. With the various changes in demand patterns due to the current economic environment being a positive catalyst for parts of the industry and a challenge to others. These customers continue to demonstrate a commitment to their digitalization initiative and a focus on making high ROI investments with AspenTech. We have generated consistent growth for many years amongst these customers and expect that trend to continue. In the energy vertical, we saw good customer activity and interest. The pause I referenced earlier was more pronounced among these customers. But we're optimistic for the balance of the fiscal year based on improving conversations around deals, as just mentioned, and a growing pipeline of opportunities. Similar to what we hear in chemicals, energy customers have made clear that the disruption from the pandemic has reinforced and need to operate their assets with greater agility and flexibility in the future. AspenTech has long been a core enabling technology to meet these goals. And as I will explain in a moment, we are poised to take our value creation to the next level. In the E&C market, as you would expect, these customers are adjusting their operations to the new levels of CapEx spending in their end markets. Positively, we went through a number of renewals in this market during Q1 and they were in line with our expectations. In one case, we had a larger renewal that was signed for a shorter than typical duration, even as these customers annual commitment with AspenTech went up. It's too early to tell if this will become more common with these customers, but this particular renewal will have an impact on the relationship between annual spend, with bookings and revenue when we report our final first quarter results. We continue to see and capture emerging opportunities for growth with these customers as they look to diversify their book of business towards operations and maintenance activities in Brownfield assets. In the quarter, we signed a new agreement with an important North American engineering firm that committed to our Aspen Fidelis and Aspen Mtell products in the APM suite as part of its efforts to grow business in this area. One thing that has become clear in the last eight months is that important global trends, including the focus of our customers and their sustainability efforts have accelerated. This means that for the industries we serve, there's this additional impetus to accelerate deployment of digital technologies to achieve their sustainability targets. The move to net-zero carbon emissions and reduction in plastic waste is being driven by treaties such as the Paris Climate Accord and society's demand for a cleaner environment. Traditionally, the return on investment from our digital technologies has been measured in efficiency and operational gains that translate into profitability. Now we're seeing more customers adopt our solutions to also address sustainability goals and justify the investment on this basis. Digitalization has been in progress for decades in the process and other capital-intensive industries and now next-generation industrial AI capabilities will become critical to addressing climate change and plastic waste in the environment. In fact in a recent survey, we conducted with ARC of global chemical and energy companies. 90% of respondents have sustainability initiatives in place and 75% of respondents rated digital transformation as highly important for achieving sustainability goals. In APM, we continue to be pleased with the level of business activity and our number of active pilots which once again set a record in the first quarter. As we discussed on our last call, we're seeing a number of delayed purchasing decisions with this suite as customers look to hold the line on expenses in the near term. We're confident this is a near-term dynamic and as a positive activity we see in multiple verticals with pipeline creation and active pilots will translate to faster growth as the economy normalizes. To highlight a couple of APM wins from the quarter, a new North American mining customer committed to deploy Aspen Mtell after our successful offline pilot, with the objective to improve the reliability of equipment in their mining operations. Similarly, we saw one of the largest Russian oil companies expand the use of Mtell to one of their largest refineries in the country after the successful rollout at their first refinery. This is part of their digitalization strategy to improve reliability across our operations. Looking forward, we remain confident in our outlook for the rest of the fiscal year, while cognizant of the difficult macro environment that our customers are facing. We had a solid first quarter. And as mentioned, the quality of conversations with our customers around quarter transactions is positive and our pipeline of business continues to grow. We are reiterating our full year annual spend growth target of 6% to 9%, which we have known will be weighted to the back half of the year. We continue to expect attrition to be in line with our guidance of 5% to 6%, and we're also confirming our full year free cash flow target of $260 million to $270 million. From a product perspective, we have recently introduced some of the most important product releases in our history as we deliver on our industrial AI product capabilities and our vision of the self-optimizing plan. We released aspenONE v12, which embeds AI across our product portfolio and uses the capabilities in the Aspen AIoT Hub to deliver enterprise-wide analytics and insights. A key advancement in v12 is the introduction of Aspen Hybrid Models, the first hybrid modeling solution ever introduced in the market. Aspen Hybrid Models captures data from assets across the enterprise and applies artificial intelligence, our historically strong capabilities in engineering first principles modeling and our 40 years of domain expertise to build the first and most comprehensive and accurate hybrid models in the market. With Aspen Hybrid Models, customers are now able to address problems that cannot be solved with engineering principles models alone, build better models faster than ever before and sustain these more accurate models in production longer than before. Aspen hybrid models is a significant achievement that has been incredibly well received by customers. In fact, hybrid model set a record with the most customers participating in our innovation club and beta testing phases. Other exciting innovations in aspenONE V12 include Aspen Multi Case, which allows customers to run thousands of concurrent simulations, either on-prem or in the cloud to allow faster and more accurate decisions to optimize operational complexity. Aspen Master an exciting new capability of DMC3 and Mtell that automates model developed by guiding newer users on how to build a model or agent. Aspen MES Collaborative, which connects data from across all assets, including a small sites where data has historically been stranded and aggregated with our enterprise level historian and Aspen Cloud Connect, which provides flexible and high-performance connectivity and security to transfer data from the edge to the cloud. We also announced the Aspen AIoT Hub, which has received terrific industry and customer feedback since its release in August. We now have the ability to enable seamless and flexible data mobility and integration from sensors to the edge and the cloud, while providing important new visualization capabilities. The AIoT Hub is a core element of our strategy as the industrial AI company. It is our cloud-ready architecture that supports the ability to collect vastly more data than ever before to support our new generation of high-value hybrid applications. It also provides an environment for data scientists to develop AI applications leveraging the machine and algorithms in the data science studio environment of the hub. This is increasingly important as customers data science groups look to contribute to the digitalization efforts of their organizations. aspenONE v12 and the AIoT Hub are only the first step in building out our complete strategy for AspenTech as the industrial AI company. Our future releases will more deeply embed AI into our solutions that further improves the speed, accuracy and quality of models built for assets that run on AspenTech products. AspenTech is democratizing the application of AI to where it can deliver the most value. We believe that Self-Optimizing Plant is key to achieving a digital enterprise and with version 12 and the AIoT Hub who are creating the foundation for that reality for our customers. In short, we're on a journey to reinvent how the process and other capital-intensive industries manage their assets and create significantly greater value. To summarize, we got off to a solid start in fiscal '21. More importantly, we have delivered a tremendous amount of new groundbreaking innovation to the market in recent months. For 40 years, AspenTech has enabled the process industries to operate in ways not previously thought possible. We are confident the new innovations in the AIoT Hub, aspenONE v12 and our broader innovation on hybrid modeling and hybrid products represent the biggest advancement in the process industries in a generation. In the near term, our focus is on supporting our customers and executing through the current economic challenges while continuing to deliver on our innovation vision. We are confident we're laying the foundation for sustainable double-digit growth as the economy normalizes. Now let me turn the call over to Karl. Karl? Yes. Well, I mean, look, Rob, you have to take all of that, that you said in the context of Q1, which is sort of our slowest growth quarter in general, areas like Europe or [indiscernible] location even the U.S. these days, it's becoming more and more. So we didn't necessarily see significant deals that pushed out of the quarter. We just saw a lower level of activity in the quarter. Certainly, in the energy sector, both upstream and refining customers had dealt with a significant amount of disruption in the previous months. And we did see a slowdown in business activity in that sector. Chemicals continue to do well for us, and we saw even some traction with EPC. So I wouldn't necessarily characterize it as you referred to as a Q3 FY '20 issue or before. It just more of a general pause in activity that we saw in the quarter. Yes. Well, let me look at it, no. And I won't talk specifically about what was the original length of that contract and where we ended up with. But in that negotiation, the interesting thing is that this is a customer that ends up going into the negotiation wanting a reduction in spend, and we end up with a transaction that - where the customer is spending more money with AspenTech at the end of the day, albeit a shorter duration contract. So certainly, not what we expected in this current environment. But what I would also say is that we have picked up conversations with that customer since that contract signed, and we'll see what happens in the future. No, I mean look, regardless of who is on the White House, if anything, regulations because they enforce a stricter standards on efficiency, especially the quality of gasoline, meaning less sulfur or less emissions or other type of stringent operating constraints, that drives actually a better spend for us because our technologies are about driving more efficiencies, and managing processes to tighter specifications and quality and so on. So in an odd way tighter regulations are more of a positive driver for us. Yes, yes no, we are - and today, the pharmaceutical industry, life sciences is in that group. So we were standing up our pharmaceutical sales organization at the moment. We'll also be looking at one or two other industries as well to do that. And - but so yes, we're in the process. We see the opportunities and it will be our organic way to move into other industries, but as we've said in the past. When we look at other industries, we also consider M&A in that regard so that. And Matt, the other thing that I would add to your first question in my prepared remarks, I referred to now the greater focus of our customers on sustainability. And in a way, sustainability targets, net-zero carbon emissions, you could think of them as stricter regulations, less plastic waste in the environment. That means customers have to find a way to produce different types of plastics that can be more easily recyclable or find ways to recover that plastic. While those may not fall on the regulations, it certainly drives customers to consider better operating standards, which is part of this theme of, therefore the need for more of our technology. Yes, yes within that range of annual spend growth that we reiterated 6% to 9% growth. In that, we assume two points of growth contribution from APM, and we - still believe we can do that. Are you talking about pharma specifically? Yes, yes. Yes, yes - maybe I know look - correct in a way, efficiencies is not a driver for the pharmaceutical industry at least not - it hasn't been, I think it will become more and more. A lot of pharmaceutical processes are starting to be shifted from batch processing to continues. And in that, we've had conversations with some pharma customers about the implementation of advanced process control. Pharma customers have been some of the early adopters of our Aspen Mtell product around reliability in their manufacturing operations. So that's really also about efficiencies. But really, the main driver for the pharma industry with AspenTech has been really manufacture and execution systems and the tracking and recording of the information and the data as these products are manufactured or produced. But more and more, we're seeing from the pharma industry an interest in analytics and AI capabilities in multivariate analytics. So, we also believe that there's an increasing opportunity in different areas of the pharma sort of supply chain. If you will from R&D on to manufacturing and then distribution to apply sophisticated analytics, including tying that to the tracking and recording of all the information associated with the production of these drugs. So we're excited about this opportunity. We've been in pharma for 20, 25 years. This is not necessarily an area that is new to us, but we just haven't been putting the investment into that area, and we will now, and we're optimistic about it. Yes. I mean look, we've become also much more efficient at doing pilots from 2, 3 years ago. We set up this team in Latin America that is sort of cloud-enabled and are involved in developing the agents and identifying the failure signatures from all these data. So we've gained tremendous efficiencies on sort of loading up tons of data into data lakes that then this team can just crank through so our pilots, originally, it would take us 6 to 8 weeks. We've cut them down to maybe a month. It also depends on how quickly customers get organized and can support us, but it's not a lengthy process. Look, once we got pilots, we're done, we don't sort of linger on with pilots. There's a few instances where customers, as part of their evaluation, do require what we call an online pilot that may go on for months, but that's a very, very small fraction of all the pilots we do, and we have very strict criteria around that type of pilot, especially commitment to a transaction when it is completed because sometimes they go for 6, 9, 12 months. But that's a very small fraction of all pilots. Normally, pilots get done very quickly. The use cases are normally use cases that are identified by customers because they know the equipment that is failing in their plants. And then we go and define the envelope that we want to look at envelope of data, all the instruments. And then we go about and do what we normally do. We've also historically asked customers to make a financial commitment to do a pilot because we didn't want pilots to turn into a science exercises, especially 2, 3 years ago when most customers were just trying to learn about AI and this technology. So we have sort of those gates, and we're pretty rigorous in the process. But we also have to now acknowledge the reality of the market. And these customers are under - some of them under severe financial constraints, and so we continue to work on their pilots. We identify the value, the justification is all there. And we sort of leave the bun in the oven, cooking a little longer until they're ready to pull the trigger. But look, there's a sales engagement in that process. We just don't forget about them. So hopefully, I answered everything you were looking for. Well, let me look, normally, we work to make sure that our priorities are included in those budgets. And that's part of the ongoing conversations we have with customers, as we look at our pipeline, part of sort of that growing pipeline of business. When we sort of reconfirm our guidance for the year, then we're taking into account, of course, many information, including what we're hearing for customers - from customers about the availability of budget into next calendar year. So it's sort of a fluid process that, in a way, it's coming to an end already started as early as September, early September for some companies. Look, my expectation is that the most important thing about a budgeting process is certainty whether that is certainty at $50 a barrel or certainty at $35, it is certainty. What we saw in the March quarter was huge uncertainty, and therefore, the natural tendency to pull back. Q4, I mean, in the June quarter was a much more stable quarter from oil prices and the stabilization of the macro environment. And therefore, there was more certainty, and we saw that. So I think as long as there's line of sight into and with more certainty into the environment in calendar '21, I think budgets will support, hopefully, a better spending environment. But we're engaged with our customers and our ability to look at our business for the fiscal year also relies on those conversations. Yes. No, look, so what I would say is digitalization front and center. Back in June, we had our call with our Executive Advisory Board, and they all felt and confirmed that, yes, OpEx and CapEx budgets were being cut, but digitalization budgets were staying. And we saw that in our June quarter. I do think in the last few months, sustainability has become a much bigger theme. If you think July, August, even September, some of the European oil companies came out and announced their commitment to net 0 carbon emissions by, I don't know, you pick the day, 2040, 2050, and that has now made investments on achieving these sustainability targets, also a priority. We absolutely saw decisions being made in Europe around our technologies purely on the basis of contributing to reductions in emissions as a result of greater efficiencies and the justification being okay, this will help us achieve our net 0 carbon emission targets, let's then allocate the budget to it. So we foresee a greater theme and justification for what AspenTech delivers to our customers on the basis of sustainability. So in my opinion, our opinion, both, I think, digitalization and sustainability will be strong drivers of investment on what we do in the future. Yes. Yes, look, and certainly, when we do our Investor Day, you guys will get the full explanation on this, so I'll try to only use a minute or so here. But look, certainly, the Self-Optimizing Plant vision is an ambitious endeavor. The idea that most processes in our - in these very complex and dangerous to operate assets will become autonomous is, in a way, the holy grail of the process industries. We believe that through the breadth and depth of technologies that we have and we have accumulated over the last 20 years, the installed base of those technologies in the market and now the leveraging of this new industry 4.0 capabilities artificial intelligence, cloud, high-performance computing, edge connectivity, all these things make the possibility of delivering autonomous processes and the Self-Optimizing Plant a real reality or possibility, if you will. So we've set ourselves a time line, I'd like to think it's an ambitious time line. And the first step in - the first building block of the Self-Optimizing Plant was released in August when we announced or early September when we announced the release of Aspen Unified, which will be the core capability around an autonomous production optimization component of the Self-Optimizing Plant. The v12 release in early October, is basically a new set of components with this hybrid modeling capabilities where you now see the introduction of machine learning, deep learning capabilities into our products to really drive a highly - much more higher monitoring of these assets on a real-time basis, where we will be able to put hybrid models online to consume data, real-time coming out of these assets and monitor for every possible parameter on this asset, whether it's process parameters, temperatures, pressures, whether it's performance parameters, around quality, density or color of these products emissions, anything. So we also believe that we can - with that capability, we're going to create an autonomous performance engineering process where - where now we can begin to automate the full engineering process around these assets and put a lot of those capabilities online. That will feed into an autonomous production optimization component and then they are an autonomous reliability component and eventually, how the supply chain fits into these assets to drive the operations. So it's an ambitious endeavor, but one that we believe we're uniquely positioned to deliver because of the breadth and depth of our technologies. And really, the growth in our capabilities around industry 4.0 technologies over the last 4 years. It's a very exciting area for us. And as I said in my prepared remarks, the hybrid modeling innovation club and beta testing phase broke all records by a long shot for those type of clubs in the history of the company. Great excitement with our customers about these capabilities. This is the first time ever that you have technology in the market that blends first principles, engineering first principles, modeling capabilities with AI modeling capabilities to create a type of product that not only embed artificial intelligence, but they are safe to deploy in this very complex assets. So, sorry for the long answer, but it's a very exciting area, and there's a lot happening there. The AIoT Hub is basically the delivery vehicle that we put in place to scale the deployment of these hybrid models across an asset and across the enterprise and that's a key component as well. There's a data science studio there with a library of data science algorithms, AI algorithms that this group of data scientists in these companies can now go on to and use to create their own custom applications and use that architecture to deploy their own solutions. So all very exciting stuff, and you'll hear more and more from us in this regard. Because there will be periodic releases of these capabilities over the next many years as we embed more and more of AI capabilities in our existing products. So, we're not having to create new products, we're just enhancing our products with these capabilities. And in that, we'll be able to monetize the higher value that will be created from the deployment of these capabilities and eventually from the delivery of the Self-Optimizing Plant. Hi Blake. Yes well, I mean look, the goal is never to eliminate people and I'll go back to 30, 35 years ago with multivariable process control. The initial fear by operators was that we're going to eliminate their jobs. And the fact is that the jobs of those operators change. They became supervisors of the technology when we closed the loop on the control of these very dangerous processes. So the goal is never to eliminate people. In our opinion, as we deploy these capabilities, the jobs of all these engineers will change. And they'll dedicate themselves to higher level tasks and higher productivity tasks. But look, having said that, it's like everything, you can use a bicycle and go from city A to city B, and it may take you 10 hours. But if you build a car and you have that car well, it will take you maybe only 30 minutes to go from city A to city B. But because now, the car becomes more popular, instead of only one person taking that ride from city A to city B, now you have hundreds or thousands of those people making that trip. So similarly, in this case, as we're able to deploy these capabilities online and automate the capture and processing of this data and the creation of the insights. We believe that more and more of this technology will be deployed 24/7, which will lock-in the consumption of the tokens like APC does or optimization does. And therefore, there will be much greater consumption of token and technology as a result of all of this. The value that it will create will be greater, and this is something that we'll talk to investors during Analyst Day. But that value is certainly the outcome of greater accuracy in the models, greater ability to predict more accurately the outcomes that are expected. And the value will vary from area-to-area and application-to-application. But look, we say we've always been about innovation, but really, we've always been about innovation that creates greater and greater value. And we've demonstrated that over the last five, 10 years and almost 40 years of the company. And this is the next phase of that journey. No, well I mean look, in a way - we were and due some unfortunate set of events over the last eight months in the world, as far as fiscal year 2021. We were fortunate that it started to take place in March, and it was fully baked in by the time we rolled into our fiscal 2021 in July. So, we had a good sense for the dynamics around the different areas of our business with E&Cs, with refiners and chemical producers. So look - as I've said in the past, the low end of our range assumes being at the higher end of the attrition range that we gave and less gross growth, meaning customers decide not to spend as much money. The high end of the range means that we'll be at the lower end of the attrition. And customers - we see the same sort of a spending pattern that we saw in our Q4 quarter fiscal year 2020. And then what is that combination? Well it will depend, but we have an internal point of view on that and I keep it - I'll rather keep it to ourselves. But look we said, we need two points of growth contribution from APM and in that, that means that it's anywhere between four to seven points of contribution from MSC and engineering. And then you have to break that down by verticals. But - and that's the one piece we don't give you guys and because it will vary and it will vary by quarter. So, we'd rather get the full year picture and then see how it came out. But look, I think Aspen Unified, which we released in August, is a driver for business this year. These hybrid modeling capabilities that we released in early October will have an impact on our results this year. The GDOT product that we released now year and a half ago had an impact in our Q1 quarter and will have a bigger impact in the rest of the year. So, we also believe that we've been putting in place new capabilities and technology that will start sort of water-falling into fiscal 2021 in a difficult macro-environment, but we're very happy with the traction for example, we're seeing around our GDOT product. And the thing about GDOT is that drives more implementations DMC3 because it's the base technology that it sits on top of. So there are many - let's just say, there's many ways to skin the cat and - we're confident about how we see it coming together. Okay, thank you operator, and we want to thank everyone for joining the call and it was a short notice, about 72 hours. But just know and trust that we're working diligently to be able to release our 10-K and eventually, our 10-Q and get back to a more normal cycle with our filings. Thank you everyone."

            "name": "Karl Johnsen",
            "content": "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our selected financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2021 ending September 30, 2020. I'm Karl Johnsen, CFO of Aspen Tech, and with me on the call is Antonio Pietri, President and CEO. Before we begin, I will make the Safe Harbor statement that during the course of this call. We may make projections or other forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from such projections or statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's call and contained in our most recently filed Form 10-Q. Also, please note that the following information relates to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, November 5, 2020. Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. The structure of today's call will be as follows. Antonio will discuss current business trends, and I will provide an update on completing the filing of our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2020 and our 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 as well as certain balance sheet items. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio? Thanks Antonio. I will provide a quick update on our cash and debt balances and the status of our 10-K and 10-Q filings. We ended the first quarter with $317.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and $427.2 million of debt outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit facility. This is an increase in cash of $29.7 million from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and reflects $2.7 million of cash taxes and $4 million in principal debt payments on our term loan. Cash collections in the quarter were strong overall and benefited from collections that were originally due in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. During the first quarter, we did not repurchase any shares, though we still intend to repurchase $200 million of our stock in fiscal 2021, depending on market conditions. I'd like to end with a quick update on the status of completing the filing of our fiscal 2020 10-K and 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. In short, nothing has fundamentally changed since September 1 in terms of the issues we are working through to complete our process. As we discussed in our filing on Form 12b-25 on September 1, and as updated by our 8-K filing on September 23, we require additional time to complete our procedures to finalize our fiscal 2020 Form 10-K as a result of additional errors identified in the transition adjustment recorded in prior fiscal years related to the adoption of ASC Topic 606. Based on what is known today, we do not expect these errors to be material. As a reminder, the issues we are working through are the same as those we previously identified last year during our initial work completing the adoption of topic 606 and as part of our fiscal 2019 10-K filings. The delay in filing our fiscal 2020 10-K will impact our ability to file our first quarter fiscal 2021 10-Q on time. Once we file our 10-K, we will move on to completing our Form 10-Q filing, which we anticipate will be done within several weeks after we finalize our Form 10-K. We are working as quickly as we can to complete this process and get current with our SEC filing obligations. As we finalize our filings, we remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities and delivering value for our customers. We believe we are well positioned to deliver on our financial objectives. With that, operator, let's begin the Q&A, please. Yes, I mean - as I said, we got to stay kind of within the four corners of our public documents. But we're moving as fast as we can on that. We expect to file it in the near future, but we're still working through it. No, it is a little bit of - we weren't prohibited from sharing any numbers statutorily. But - it's a little bit serial in nature for the team that's finalizing the 10-K. What they're doing is it's really just proving out the balance on the contract asset. And that work is very detailed, and it takes a long time to get through. We're working with the auditors. Nothing has materially changed from the initial work we did months ago. It's just a matter of getting the auditors through that. Because of that, it's a balance sheet item, it would roll forward. So, we need to make sure that we get that finalized with the auditors then we can finalize our Q1. We are closing the books on a monthly basis, and we continue to close them. But because we're not - we haven't had the auditors come in and review the quarter because they're still working on the K. It would be difficult to go and let the - put out metrics on the Q and then have them change. So, we are closing the books. We've closed Q1. I do have my point of view of where it is. But before we release, we would have to have the auditors get through that."

With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks, Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'm excited to welcome you to our first earnings call as a new AspenTech. We're thrilled to have successfully completed our transaction with Emerson during the fourth quarter and to have welcomed the talented teams of OSI and their Digital Grid Management portfolio of products or DGM and the Subsurface Science & Engineering team and their portfolio of products or SSE into AspenTech. This transformative transaction generated significant value for our shareholders and created a leading industrial software company with multiple paths to future long-term value creation for our customers and shareholders. I would like to start by providing an overview of the breadth and scale of our business today before reviewing our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2023. Today, the new AspenTech is one of the world's leading industrial software companies and well-positioned to generate double-digit top and bottom line growth at scale.  We now generate more than $1 billion in annual revenue and nearly $800 million in Annual Contract Value or ACV. The new business growth metric we're introducing this quarter and for which Chantelle will provide more details later in the call. The two businesses contributed by Emerson had leading software solutions that significantly diversified AspenTech's operations and increased our opportunities for growth in new industries and from sustainability investment trends. The [DGM] [ph] portfolio of software solutions and services for the power transmission and distribution or T&D market provides AspenTech a market leading position in a fourth vertical. DGM will benefit from three micro drivers in the T&D market. First, the ongoing upgrading and expansion of the grid as part of global electrification to achieve net zero carbon emissions. Second, the growing complexity of the grid resulting from the introduction of renewable power. And third, the need for improved cybersecurity as the grid is critical infrastructure. These three drivers are catalyst for greater digitalization of the grid to manage larger systems of greater complexity. SSC, formerly known as GSS, is a leading portfolio of software solutions that are highly complementary to our existing upstream business. AspenTech can now provide a set of solutions that add value to the entire lifecycle of an upstream customer's operation by integrating subsurface and above surface modeling and simulation capabilities to unlock additional value in operations. SSC also expands our reach into sustainability areas of the market like carbon capture and sequestration or CCS and geothermal energy. The employees from each company are a strong cultural fit with our heritage business with the same passion for innovation and desire to solve the most complex operational challenges facing our cost customers. The executive leadership team and I have spent significant time with many of the employees of both businesses in recent months and have become even more impressed that we have gotten to know them better. From an integration and transformation perspective, we\u2019re tracking well against our plan. We have detailed integration plans for each functional area and for each of the synergy streams, including the cross-selling initiatives between each of the businesses and those associated with the Emerson commercial agreement. We're also making progress recognizing the DGM and SSC product portfolios and converting the DGM portfolio to a term license structure. As we know from our own experience, the [token term] [ph] licensing model will unlock value for our customers and lead to broader and faster adoption of the products in the suite over time. We're pleased with the progress today and feel very good that we will deliver on our target of $110 million of adjusted EBITDA synergies by fiscal year 2026 driven through a combination of ACV growth and cost synergies over time. The benefits of the Emerson transaction extend beyond the DGM and SSC product portfolios. We also formalized our new commercial agreement with Emerson that will make AspenTech solutions available to sell into markets where we have limited presence today such as pharmaceuticals and pulp and paper. Emerson has created a dedicated sales team focused on accelerating adoption of AspenTech products and solutions across a range of these targeted industries and we have established a corresponding team within AspenTech to support and enable Emerson to ensure we capitalize on this significant opportunity. Over time, we will realize additional benefits as more of our products and solutions are integrated into Emerson's industrial systems and as the two organizations identify opportunities for joint innovation that will begin to transform our solutions are delivered to and adopted by customers. In addition, our increased scale and the support of Emerson have expanded our capacity and ability to pursue M&A opportunities. The recent announcement of our definitive agreement to acquire Micromine is a great example. Micromine has developed a great set of software solutions that help metal and mining companies improve their safety, sustainability, reliability, and efficiency of their operations. The metals and mining industry will play a critical role in the energy transition and it's at the very early stages of investing in the digitalization initiative that will enable them to meet that need. We look forward to completing this transaction in our fiscal second quarter, subject to regulatory approval. Finally, the scale of the new AspenTech and its critical role in the capital intensive industries is attracting talent of quality, expertise, and diversity to the company as proven by the members of our new Board of Directors. This injection of new talent will materially benefit the trajectory of this company over many years to come. In addition, as the company scales, we're enhancing a specific organizational capabilities and systems. For example, in our go to market area, we have created an organization focused on the newly expanded set of key industries to sharpen our strategy messaging and go to market execution in each of these industries. We have also expanded our partners organization with the intent to increase our market relationships at a leverage point for market penetration and adoption of our products and solutions. I could not be more excited about what we have built at AspenTech and the opportunity ahead of us. We have assembled one of the most comprehensive set of solutions in the industrial software market and are well-positioned to help our customers address the dual challenge of beating the increasing global demand for resources in a sustainable manner. The dual challenge is central to the continuation of global prosperity and that is why we have made it our mission, as the global population grows by another 2 billion people by 2050. As more and more people expect a better standard of living, and as society expects companies in capital intensive industries to sustainably produce their resources to meet the future needs of the global population, an investment over the next 20 to 30 years of a magnitude that hasn't been seen before in the history of humanity will be required to achieve the complete transformation of the global economy to meet the dual challenge. This investment will focus not only on climate change, but also on circularity, eliminating plastic waste in the environment, and will drive the innovation and deployment of technologies and digital capabilities to achieve these environmental imperatives. We believe the new AspenTech is uniquely positioned to help companies in capital intensive industries meet the dual challenge. With that backdrop, I would like to turn to our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. Since the Emerson transaction closed in mid-May, and June 30 is our fiscal year-end, I will focus my commentary primarily on the heritage AspenTech business. Annual spend for the full-year for the heritage AspenTech business was $674 million, up 2.8% in the quarter and 8.5% year-over-year, which was above the high-end of our guidance range and free cash flow for the full-year for the heritage AspenTech business was approximately $286 million. Please note that this excludes a discrete tax payment associated with the Emerson transaction that Chantelle will discuss in more detail later. We're pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, which was strong across each of our key verticals and regions. Importantly, we did not see any impact from the worsening economic environment in Q4. The spending environment in our core markets continued to improve as the business and financial performance of our customers has strengthened. After a couple of years of muted investment in their operational excellence and sustainability initiatives, it is clear from transactions closed in the fourth quarter and fiscal year that customers are pursuing more strategic engagements with us and continue the process of standardizing across their operations on our products and solutions to drive greater efficiencies and sustainability gains. Overall, fiscal year 2022 played out much as we hoped it would, which provides us confidence as we enter fiscal year 2023. An important trend that saw acceleration across our business in fiscal year 2022 is how the sustainability imperative is influencing sales activity. Customers across all of our end markets are recognizing the need to step up their focus on sustainability and are putting in place initiatives around emissions reduction, decarbonization, and circularity that will fundamentally change the design, operation, and reliability of their assets in order to meet their sustainability ambitions. Our newly expanded set of solutions will support our customers drive to meet these targets although set by government agencies as a result of the growing regulatory push towards greater environmental disclosure and compliance. As a point of note, a recent webinar held by AspenTech on carbon capture and sequestration garnered a record amount of interest with over 1,900 registrants, a clear indication of the growing focus of our customers on decarbonization and sustainability. Looking at our performance by vertical in the year, Refining had another strong quarter that was the best of the fiscal year. [Crack spreads] [ph] during the fourth quarter were at all-time highs and while they have cooled-off in recent weeks, they remain in the upper quartile of their historical range. We're optimistic about the profitability and demand environment for the refining industry and the growth that it will support for us. Energy security is also leading to a rethink of the medium to long term need for refining capacity in certain parts of the world. Chemicals continues to be a source of strength for our business. Chemical customers recognize that driving greater efficiencies in their operations and mitigating their environmental impact through digitalization is critical to their future business performance. We're also confident about the long-term growth of the industry as global chemical demand is expected to increase 300% by 2050 according to the World Energy Forum placing the industry at the center of meeting the dual challenge as I had previously discussed. The E&C vertical continues on its transformation path as more customers focus on sustainability investments such as renewable power, hydrogen, carbon capture and sequestration and other technologies. This, along with improved medium-term outlook for oil CapEx spend, and an unexpected increase in LNG facilities investments to drive backlog growth for the E&C industry. We're optimistic this vertical will show improvement going forward as it reopens, as it repositions itself towards sustainability and the associated CapEx trends. I would now like to say a few words about the industries in which OSI and SSC operate. Digitalizing the transmission and distribution industry is critical to transforming how this industry operates to support global sustainability, with the DGM portfolio of products perfectly positioned in this regard. It is estimated that energy demand will grow by 50% by 2050 as the global population increases and achieves a better standard of living, which means that to reach net zero carbon emissions in that timeframe, 75% of the increase in energy demand will need to be supplied by electricity and 90% of it will need to come from renewable sources. This means the electrical grid will need to expand significantly and will become more complex, which will require greater and more sophisticated digital capabilities to manage and optimize their operations. This is where OSI and DGM products play a central role. The DGM product portfolio was developed to meet the increasing complexity of the grid, including advanced capabilities such as advanced distribution management systems, ADMS or electricity distribution and distributed energy resource management systems terms, which address a complexity introduced by intermittent sources of electricity into the grid from renewable sources. OSI has also developed capabilities to manage microgrids found in industrial facilities, commercial buildings and other assets or systems that cannot afford the loss of power from public utilities. We also see this application as an important cross-sell opportunity into the heritage AspenTech industrial customer base and furthermore into Micromine's customer base once the transaction closes. Looking ahead, we expect that significant CapEx spend will be dedicated to upgrading and expanding the grid, increasing the demand for DGM solutions for many years to come through all phases of the business cycle. It is important to note that OSI\u2019s business is levered through CapEx projects the highly regulated utility industry and not tied to the traditional CapEx investment drivers in oil and gas and chemicals, behaving more like OpEx investments. We're also very excited about the SSC product portfolio in the oil and gas exploration and production area. The integration of the SSE sub surface capabilities with our engineering suite above surface capabilities will create a unique offering in the market. We're already seeing a strong customer interest in this combined offering and its ability to drive innovation in the space. We believe that CapEx budgets in the upstream sector will grow over the next three to five years in order to maintain and increase supply of oil and gas. This is a trend that we already see. Over time, we will create a new path for growth for this portfolio of products focused on decarbonization capabilities and renewable sources of energy such as CCS and geothermal energy, respectively. In addition, existing SSC product capabilities will complement the Micromine suite of products to further differentiate the performance of that future products suite. Finally, we're now the only company able to provide a comprehensive solution to model the entire petroleum value chain from the rock in the reservoir to the distribution of fuel to the corner gas station and into the chemical supply chain. As we typically do on our year-end earnings call, I would now like to provide you with some additional details about our performance for the full-year 2022, all of which are on an annual spend basis. I will start from a product perspective and focus specifically on the performance of the heritage AspenTech businesses. Engineering business grew annual spend 5.5% for the year, generating 38% of our overall annual spend growth. This was stronger than we initially expected and driven in large part by better performance by owner operators, which resulted in lower attrition and higher gross growth. Our manufacturing and supply chain or MSC business delivered annual spend growth of 12.1%, representing 55% of our total annual spend growth. We saw a significant improvement in MSC performance throughout the year as our owner operator customers, particularly refiners saw business conditions improve as COVID-related disruptions abated. The asset performance management or APM business generated total annual strength growth of 14% or 7% of our total annual spend growth for the year contributing 0.6 points of annual spend growth. The performance of the APM suite was impacted by headwinds from attrition, mainly in two areas. One, we had several E&Cs that purchased APM entitlement in the last couple of years as part of their business initiative to generate revenue growth from operations and maintenance activities in brownfield site. The expected revenue growth from this activity did not materialize as a result of depressed demand, due to COVID, so these agreements were not renewed. And two, select customers in Asia and other regions that lacked their on-site support during COVID lockdowns required for the successful deployment of the product. The APM gross growth in the fourth quarter was one of the strongest in the history of the suite. Total gross growth for the suite in fiscal year 2022 equated to 1.1 points of growth. The outlook for APM attrition in fiscal year 2023 is much improved as a result of most E&C contract renewals have been already [up here] [ph] and more mature customer success process, including remote support and expectation of improved demand for this suite going forward. Customer interest remains very high and we continue have a sizable and growing pipeline of opportunities. Shifting to our verticals. The Energy, Chemicals and Engineering construction verticals contributed 54%, 32%, and 7% of our growth in annual spend during the year, respectively. Global Economy Industries or GEIs contributed 7% of our annual spend growth for the year and grew 9% in the year. For the full-year, the attrition rate for heritage AspenTech was 5%. The acceleration in annual spend growth this year was split between lower attrition and higher gross growth. We generated 13.4% gross growth in fiscal year 2022, which was approximately a 200 basis point improvement from last year. We are pleased with the growth performance during the year and believe it sets a stage for further improvement in the years to come. As you can see, we had a strong fiscal year 2022 and enter fiscal year 2023 with a great deal of momentum.  The trends in each of our end markets are positive and the addition of the DGM and SSC product portfolios provide exposure to new markets that are also [trend favorite] [ph]. At the same time, we\u2019re mindful of the evolving macroenvironment and its potential to weigh on economic activity in the coming quarters, while also remaining vigilant about future COVID developments and geopolitical considerations. So, while we're optimistic about our performance in fiscal year 2023, we think it's prudent to assume a wider range of potential outcomes. Similar to recent years, we expect fiscal year 2023 to be a tailor to halves. We currently have greater visibility and confidence into the first half of the year given the ongoing strength in our end markets and as customers look to utilize their calendar 2022 budget commitment. Conversely, we see several potential scenarios for customers calendar 2023 budgets depending on how the macro environment evolves in the next two quarters. Putting all these together, our current expectation is for ACV growth in fiscal year 2023 to be 10.5% to 13.5% for new AspenTech. There are several assumptions underpinning our guidance. First, DGM and SSC are expected to contribute approximately 4 points of growth in total this year. The DGM product portfolio has had a good start in the fiscal year, especially considering the sale, acquire, divest processes involving the OSI business for the better part of the last two years.  We're also seeing notable market strength from the SCC product portfolio supported by improved CapEx spend, a better position business after the completion of its restructuring under Emerson ownership, and the potential value creation from the integration of their capabilities with their engineering suite of heritage AspenTech. We're bullish about the outlook for these two product portfolios going forward. Second, we currently expect growth in the first half of fiscal 2023 to build up on the momentum in recent quarters. The current operating outlook for our customers in calendar 2022 is very healthy and support the budget and current spend rates in place. Based on today's macro outlook for oil demand and supply and market dynamics, we expect calendar 2023 budgets to support a continuation of the spend experienced this year, but we prefer to take a prudent approach to our ACV growth range. To put a finer point in the range, the high-end of our range assumes that the DGM and SCC product portfolios will perform as projected in our guidance given the respective market dynamics and the heritage AspenTech product suites will see a continuation of improvement in the spend experienced so far in calendar 2022 into calendar 2023. This outcome assumes little or no impact from any economic deceleration. And the low-end of the range assumes the macro outlook gets materially worse, due to economic conditions, COVID developments and/or geopolitical considerations, resulting in reduced customer spend for the heritage AspenTech suites with owner operators, supporting a growth outcome for those suites similar to fiscal year 2022 was the DGM and SSC product portfolios delivered a performance as projected in our guidance. It's important to note that in any of these scenarios, we're confident that we will deliver a year of double-digit growth in ACV. Third, from a suite perspective, we expect [Engineering and Emerson] [ph] suites will contribute 6 to 8 points of growth, DGM will contribute 3 points, SSC 1 point, and APM is expected to contribute approximately 0.5 points to 1.5 points of growth. Lastly, attrition is expected to be approximately 7% to 8% for the year. The heritage AspenTech attrition is expected to show continued improvement to 3% to 4% for the year, the SSE suite attrition is expected to be approximately 4% for the year, which we would expect to improve in the coming years. DGM is not expected to have any material attrition. While the economic outlook is unclear at the moment, what is clear is that AspenTech is performing at a high level and well-positioned for the future. We meaningfully accelerated growth over the cost \u2013 over the course of fiscal year 2022 and have laid the foundation for durable double-digit growth in the future. The OSI and SSC businesses and the pending acquisition of Micromine provide exciting new growth opportunities and meaningfully diversify our end market exposure. Fiscal year 2022 was the most transformative year in the history of the company. We delivered excellent operational and financial results, while signing and executing our transaction with Emerson. This is the most exciting time in the 40-plus year history of AspenTech and we're well-positioned to deliver greater value than ever before for our customers and shareholders. I want to conclude by recognizing the extraordinary work done by the heritage AspenTech team to deliver the exceptional operational and financial results achieved in fiscal year 2022 and also thank the new AspenTech team for their outstanding effort to continue to make our transformation possible. I strongly believe the best is yet to come and that your efforts will result in significant value creation for all stakeholders of the company. With that, let me turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you, Antonio. I have several different topics to cover today, so let's jump right in. Let me start with our reported GAAP financial results for the fourth quarter and the full-year fiscal 2022, which are not comparable to the guidance heritage AspenTech provided on its fiscal third quarter earnings call in April, due to the completion of the Emerson transaction and the associated accounting. As previously reported, Emerson acquired a 55% stake in the new AspenTech on May 16, 2022. As such, the subsidiary Emerson set up as part of the transaction, EmerSubCX, which included the DGM and SSC businesses became the surviving entity once the transaction was completed. Therefore, under accounting rules, the GAAP results you see in our press release today reflect the full quarter's results for DGM and SSE and 45 days of results from Heritage AspenTech, reflecting the period from May 16 to June 30. In addition, as part of Emerson, EmerSubCX was on a September 30 fiscal year-end, which changed to June 30 to align with the Heritage AspenTech's fiscal year-end. As a result, you will see that the year-end results shown in our financial tables are for the nine-month period of October 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022 and includes the nine-month fiscal period of DGM and SSC financials and 45 days of Heritage AspenTech. As a result of these adjustments, our income statement and statement of cash flows this quarter and for the full period are not indicative of the financial performance of either Heritage AspenTech or new AspenTech. However, since the balance sheet is a snapshot in time as of June 30, it provides a useful view for investors of our underlying financial strength.  One item I would like to provide further context for is free cash flow in the quarter. The Emerson transaction and resulting change in control required a short period U.S. federal consolidated tax return for the period May 17, 2022 through June 30, 2022. This period was considered a separate tax year and resulted in the recognition of taxable income associated with our contract asset balance. This resulted in a pull-forward of approximately 65 million of cash tax payments into the month of June. Adjusting for this discrete tax payment, and additional transaction related items, free cash flow for the heritage AspenTech business was approximately $286 million in-line with our prior outlook. Due to these unusual circumstances, which will only apply to the fourth quarter of FY 2022 since that is when the transaction closed, as well as the dynamics of our revenue recognition in our model, which I will discuss next. We believe it is more helpful for investors to focus on the key metrics we provide. Now, on to revenue recognition. Our term license financial results are reported under Topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of revenue recognition for our term license contracts. License revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings and more specifically renewal bookings. We define bookings of the total value of customer term license and perpetual SMS contracts delivered in the current period. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years and this non-linearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods, resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. As is common in the software industry, our bookings are typically back-end weighted towards the end of the quarter and the fourth quarter is typically, but not always our largest bookings quarter. As a result, it is not unusual to see resulting revenue decline sequentially in the first fiscal quarter. For [OSI specifically] [ph], license and professional services revenue when sold together in a customer arrangement is generally recognized over time as one performance obligation using percentage of completion accounting. Revenue recognition ends related to license and professional services revenue when implementation is complete. Maintenance revenues recognized ratably for OSI arrangements over the underlying maintenance term and commencing once implementation is complete. As those who have followed us in the past know, we provide supplemental metrics to help investors get a clear sense of the underlying growth of the business. Starting this quarter, we will be transitioning from annual spend to ACV, annual contract value as our primary growth metric. We have posted a slide deck and video presentation on the Investor Relations section of our website to provide greater detail on this change. Historical ACV results going back to the first quarter of fiscal 2020 can be found in our earnings presentation. I encourage all of you to take a look at both. I will not review all the information in that deck on this call, but here are a few key takeaways. We define ACV as an estimate of the annual value of our portfolio term license and term in perpetual software maintenance and support or SMS. agreements. ACV provides insight into the annual growth and retention of our recurring revenue base, which is a large majority of our overall revenue, as well as recurring cash flow. ACV is how we manage the business internally on a day-to-day basis and is the primary corporate performance goal we used to incentivize and compensate our management and sales teams. ACV is functionally very similar to heritage AspenTech's annual spend metric. The only difference between the two metrics is the inclusion of perpetual SMS into ACV. In the near-term, perpetual SMS will continue to increase due to the completion of existing OSI projects underway and the fact OSI will continue to sell some [indiscernible] licenses. As we transition OSI and SSC's businesses to our term license token model, we would expect perpetual SMS ACV to decline. In addition, the small residual amount of perpetual SMS in the heritage AspenTech business will continue to decline. The projected ACV growth and guidance is inclusive of these dynamics. For DGM products, [ACV act] [ph] currently only captures a fraction of their overall business related to term license and perpetual SMS due to the revenue accounting associated with the selling of bundle licenses and service as previously discussed. It does not capture DGM's perpetual licenses, professional services, or hardware revenue. The proportion of DGM revenue that will be represented in ACV is expected to continue to grow over time as we execute on our strategy. The transition to ACV serves a few purposes. The inclusion of perpetual SMS provides greater visibility into DGM and SSE \u2013 current SSE's current recurring revenue streams. It will also provide insight into the ongoing transformation of BGM and SSE's respective business models to AspenTech's tokenized term license model and ACV is a commonly used metric across the software industry and this transition may provide greater comparability for AspenTech with other companies. With that as a background, I would like to spend a moment reviewing ACV in more detail. All growth rates referenced are a year-over-year basis. ACV, which is a snapshot in time and unaffected by the timing of the Emerson transaction, was $791 million at the end of the fourth quarter, up 7.8% year-over-year, breaking that down further, Engineering ACV was $373 million, up 5.5%, MSC ACV was 275 million, up 11.5%, APM ACV was 30 million, up 14%, SSC ACV was 70 million, down 1% and DGM ACV was 43 million, up 19%. Taken together, heritage AspenTech ACV, which includes engineering, MSC, and APM was $678 million, up 8.2%. The difference between this growth rate and the 8.5% annual spend growth rate is the inclusion of approximately $4 million of remaining perpetual SMS and ACV that is slowly declining as the long tail of customers move away from the very old perpetual licenses. Overall, DGM and SSC demonstrated solid performance despite working through sizable integration activities and the distraction of the pending transaction with AspenTech. They have both entered fiscal year 2023 having [been past] [ph] these challenges. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of the business and the significant improvement in growth generated in fiscal year 2023. As Antonio noted, the underlying trends in our core markets are favorable and we are well-positioned to deliver faster growth over time as we execute on our strategic objectives. I would now like to provide some more detail on the progress we have made on the integration of DGM and SSE and how we are tracking against our synergy targets. To build on Antonio's earlier discussion, I'm pleased with our integration and synergy planning process for fiscal year 2023. We have delivered on the critical success criteria for our day one readiness plan. Our fiscal year 2023 plans incorporate the specific contribution from synergy initiatives from both top line growth and expense productivity. We do not plan on providing quarterly updates on our synergy progress, but we do plan on reporting underperformance at the end of the fiscal year. Before I turn to guidance, I would like to discuss our balance sheet and the pending acquisition of Micromine. We ended the quarter with $449.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $273.6 million of total debt. Our strong balance sheet is a strategic asset for the company and is underpinned by our highly profitable business model with multi-year contracts that are paid annually in advance with yields predictable and sustained cash flow generation. As we highlighted as part of the Emerson transaction, the increased scale and capabilities of the new AspenTech provides a great opportunity to pursue additional acquisitions that broaden our capabilities and market reach. Our recent announcement of our proposed acquisition of Micromine is a great example. Micromine has developed a set of world-class software solutions for the metals and mining industry. Its end-to-end solutions enable miners to digitalize their operations and significantly improve safety sustainability, reliability, and efficiency. Micromine is a great strategic fit for AspenTech and is well aligned with our focus on the dual challenge. The metals and mining industry will be a key strategic enabler of electrification, which will require substantial investments. We are paying [AUD$900 million] [ph] or approximately US$623 million for Micromine, which we expect to close in the second fiscal quarter subject to regulatory approval. We are intending to finance the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and a new $475 million bridge term loan at the time of closing. We are very comfortable operating with that level of debt on our balance sheet and we will still have available capacity to pursue additional M&A opportunities. I would now like to close with guidance for fiscal year 2023. As Antonio mentioned, our outlook reflects both the strong underlying demand trends we see across the business, as well as a wider range of potential outcomes to reflect the growing uncertainty in the economy. To that end, we are targeting 10.5% to 13.5% ACV growth for fiscal 2023. From a suite perspective, we expect the engineering MSC suites will contribute 6 points to 8 points of growth. DGM will contribute 3 points, SSC 1 point, and APM is expected to contribute approximately 0.5 point to 1.5 points of growth. Attrition is expected to be between 7% and 8% for the year. Note that we do continue expected improvement in heritage \u2013 we do expect continued improvement in heritage AspenTech Nutrition trends in fiscal year 2023, and estimate approximately 3 points to 4 points of attrition. We expect an additional 4 points of attrition from SSC during the fiscal year. We expect minimal attrition from DGM in fiscal 2023. We expect total bookings in the range of $1.07 billion to $1.17 billion, which includes $547 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2023. We expect revenue in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.2 billion. From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $1.186 billion to $1.196 billion. Taken together, we expect GAAP operating income in a range of loss of $46 million to positive $6 million with GAAP net income over a range of negative $8 million to positive $24 million. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of a loss of $0.12 to positive $0.36. From a non-GAAP perspective, we expect total non-GAAP expenses of $637 million to $647 million, non-GAAP operating income of $503 million to $555 million, and non-GAAP income per share in the range of $6.40 to $6.89. As a reminder, our non-GAAP results exclude the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions, and acquisition and integration planning related fees. Note that as a result of the Emerson transaction and the estimated purchase price allocation to intangible assets, fiscal year 2023 results will include a significant increase in the expense related to the amortization of intangibles. This will impact our GAAP profitability. From a free cash flow perspective, we expect free cash flow of $347 million to $362 million. Our fiscal 2023 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payment in the range of $94 million to $104 million. To wrap up, our business is performing at a high level and is well-positioned for the future. We are incredibly excited about the new AspenTech and our ability to deliver even more value for our customers as we help them solve the dual challenge. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Pfau. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri : Hi, Matt.\nMatthew Pfau: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate it guys. Wanted to ask the guidance for ACV growth related to the heritage Aspen business, it seems like under the bulk case assumption there, there would only be a slight acceleration from what you saw in fiscal 2022. So, maybe just help us understand why under that bull case where the momentum continues into fiscal 2023, we wouldn't see more of an acceleration in the ACV growth in the heritage Aspen business?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Matt, if you breakdown the guidance that we gave, which is basically at the top of the range is 8.4 heritage AspenTech, or engineering and MSC it is 3 points for DGM 1 point for SSC and 0.5 points to 1.5 points for APM. The growth of heritage AspenTech on an annual spend basis is about 11%. So, the thing is the denominator \u2013 you're looking at a different denominator as well. ACV, we ended the year at $672 million of annual spend.  The ACV base is now 791. So, the numbers are shifting, so it makes it a little harder to estimate, but if you use the same basis for heritage AspenTech, we're projecting our heritage AspenTech business to grow about 11% in fiscal 2023.\nMatthew Pfau: Got it. Really helpful. And then just one follow-up on the Micromine acquisition, maybe you can just talk about your ability to integrate that acquisition while it is still at the same time still working through the Emerson integration? Thanks.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, I'd like to think that one of our core expertise in AspenTech in old heritage Aspen and new Aspen is execution. We have a very detailed plan around integration and transformation activities, including capturing the synergies we\u2019re well into that execution. Micromine is an ongoing business, full blown business with its own organization structure and so on. Once that transaction closes, that business will be able to run on its own with its current management structure, it's our expectation, and will take time to fully integrate it into AspenTech is a business that is accelerating their term licensing business and growth into mining on a global basis. So, while we will work on integrating some of the administrative functions and systems, we'll leave it to run on its own for a period of time.\nMatthew Pfau: Great. Thanks guys.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Andrew.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Hi Andrew.\nAntonio Pietri: Andrew, you might be on mute.\nAndrew Obin: I am on mute. Can you hear me now?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes.\nAndrew Obin: Yes, apologies. Can you just give us more color on Micromine, what was the timeline of the acquisition? What was Emerson team's involvement? And how does Micromine if at all integrates with Emerson's control offering?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, let me look at \u2013 so this is an asset that we've known about for a while. Of course, it's owned by private equity at the moment and it was at that point that the potential, the private equity firm that decided to pick up a process to determine the interest on the asset that we got engaged. It was a fast moving process. Certainly, Emerson\u2019s capabilities and expertise contributed to our ability to execute fast and successfully in this. Emerson was fully involved in determining the adequate value and also consent into the funding for the transaction. And then look as far as \u2013 this is pure software technology, so eventually how it integrates into Emerson systems, we'll have to take a look at that like we are and we will about some of our solutions today in the MSC suite, but Emerson has an existing business in a couple of regions for mining. And we believe that it will be certainly \u2013 there will be synergies both to AspenTech and eventually Emerson as a channel for those \u2013 for that software as well.\nAndrew Obin: Thanks a lot. And since closing the deal, could you just give us color on how the commercial agreement with Emerson is working in real life and for heritage AspenTech, what kind of impact are you seeing from this commercial agreement? Thanks a lot.\nAntonio Pietri: Chantelle, would you like to tackle that first?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yeah. Yeah. I can definitely give some color to Andrew and then Antonio can come with any extra. So, I would say, we're off to a fantastic start. We have the organization in place. We're clear on roles and engagement. We've had [indiscernible] in meetings. We have geographical trips planned. We have account planning underway. So, I think it's off to an amazing start and I think we're clear with [quotas] [ph] and targets on both sides of the relationships. So, quite excited personally by the speed that we've been moving at. I think that \u2013 so now we have all that, Andrew, I think the results will be more of a Q1 conversation as we're just getting started. The thing I can tell you is that the joint account teams are knowing each other. They're very interested in how they can help each other and that relationship, I think, is off to a great start in Q1.\nAndrew Obin: Thanks a lot.\nAntonio Pietri : Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Celino. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Jason. You\u2019re probably on mute as well, Jason.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, Sorry. This is actually [Devon] [ph] on for Jason. Thanks for taking our question. First one I have is on the APM, just curious to hear from some of your recent customer wins and maybe any, sort of updates you can provide on the number of pilots you implemented during the quarter. Just want to, and any sort of color you can provide on what's given you the confidence on that growth range in fiscal 2023?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. I mean, look, so as we stated in the call in the prepared remarks, we saw strong demand for APM in fiscal 2022, about 1.1 points of gross growth. Unfortunately, we did have the set of customers that did not realize the benefit from the use of that software to deliver on projects and then other customers that were under very strict lockdowns over the last 12, 18 months that ended up not successfully deploying the solution. But having said that, we believe that most of that is beyond us. We have a strong pipeline in fiscal 2023 for APM. And in addition, Emerson will be taken to market our APM suite. They have already identified a pipeline of opportunities for APM in different markets and some of them we hope will close this quarter as well. So, overall, we feel good about that suite. Certainly, COVID created different dynamics, but now that we're moving beyond COVID into a more normal environment, we believe that range that we gave for guidance is a comfortable one for that suite.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thanks for the color. And maybe just one more on Micromine, seems like a great fit to new AspenTech, could you maybe provide some color on the competitive landscape there? Who's their main competitors in that business? Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, as we move into new areas, we're taking on a new sets of competitors. While with OSI, it's been more of the traditional industrials in the transmission and distribution business, GE and ABB and Siemens and so on. For Micromine is more pure software players, companies like Bentley, Aveva, Dassault and a couple of other ones. So, we're looking forward to engaging in competitive situations with the software companies. Jason or sorry, you might be on mute again.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's it. Thank you for the color.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, no problem. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hey, Mark.\nMark Schappel: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Antonio, I was wondering if you could just provide some additional color around Micromine, just building off some of the earlier questions. And this would be around things such as how much revenue do they generate annually, what's the revenue growth rate, what does the profitability profile look like?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, Mark, we will come up once the transaction closes with basically a new set of projections for the combined new AspenTech with Micromine, but the revenue will certainly be material. We've always said that anything that we acquire needs to support or be accretive to our double-digit growth ambitions and best-in-class profitability. You can assume that that is the case in this instance that in both metrics that are accretive to our profitability and double-digit growth ambitions.\nMark Schappel: Okay, great. And then question around your customers' sustainability initiatives. I know in the past, I believe a few, if not, a few more customers have set up separate sustainability budgets that I know you were hoping or intended to sell into. I was wondering if you could just comment on what you're seeing with respect to that trend, whether you're seeing more companies or customers set up separate sustainability budgets?\nAntonio Pietri: Look, at the end of the day, and by the way, we have an initiative internally to be able to identify opportunities that were driven specifically for sustainability reasons or profitability reasons or both because sometimes, most times is one and the same. We can make our customers profitable and sustainable at the same time with the same products, but look, what it is absolutely true is that almost every conversation with our customers now involves sustainability areas, whether it is how to reduce emissions, how to track emissions, whether it is chemicals recycling, [indiscernible], hydrogen, carbon capture and sequestration, as I mentioned in the call. I mean, we held a seminar two weeks ago. I've been in this company for 26.5 years and I was blown away to hear that we had 1,900 people registered for that webinar, which is unbelievable. So, look, there's no doubt that the sustainability imperative is real. We now saw how the U.S. Senate approved a big sustainability investment and we believe that this will continue to be a trend. More and more companies involved in decarbonization, air carbon capture, electrical batteries. Today, Google and Facebook are customers of AspenTech, new customers, but they are. They're using our engineering suites to model energy consumption in some of their data farms or server farms. So, there's a lot going on in the space and what we're seeing is a new category of customers that are driven mainly by their technology innovation around sustainability.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. I think the other thing I would add to is, I think there's going to be a convergence between the markets and our customer. So, very true, what Antonio said from a customer perspective, but the other thing I would add is the markets and how their [indiscernible] is changing. If you read some of the recent articles from some of the banks on [Green CapEx] [ph], you know now we're starting to talk about CapEx as Green CapEx and categorizing it into sustainability things such as electrification, emission, [CCF] [ph]. I think those things will start to converge as our customers decide their inner workings in the sense of who owns those and how they configure it to this [indiscernible]. So, I would just offer that additional context.\nMark Schappel : Great. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: [Technical Difficulty] comes from the line of [Patrick Scholes] [ph]. Your line is open. \nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Patrick.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little more about the earlier receptivity you are getting from Emerson customers as they move on to the Aspen token model? And then can you also remind us on what the contract durations look like and how long you think it will take to get the new customers [move forward] [ph] to the token model?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, so I assume you're referring to the SSE and OSI businesses, so there's also the commercial agreement and Emerson going to market on their own, reselling our products and solutions. Eventually, Emerson will find new customers through that commercial agreement that where they'll sign up to the suites of heritage AspenTech and those will be token licensing entitlement. And, well that should happen even this quarter and over the next few quarters and years. Look, it takes a few months to set up tokenized products, meaning set up the license management systems and adapt the products so that they can tap into the license management system that ongoing work for both SSC and OSI.  So, our expectation is that the real impact from tokenization will be felt in fiscal 2024 and beyond, but in the meantime, we were taking those products to market as term products, meaning we're trying to sell them on a term basis product-by-product and eventually we'll also compare those customers to full token customers, but our focus right now is on getting everything ready so that late this year, fiscal year and into fiscal 2024, we're in full mode of selling token licenses and really having a business where we've already de-bundled services and license with OSI and we're now already with a lot of momentum in the transformation of these two businesses.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri : Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Pietri, I'll turn the call back over to you.\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I want to thank everyone again. This my 40th earnings call as CEO of AspenTech, but it is my first call as CEO of the new AspenTech, very glad to have had this call. We're incredibly excited about the future and what lies ahead for new AspenTech and look forward to engaging you all and with Chantelle as well in future investor conferences and roadshows. So, thank you everyone.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chantelle Breithaupt",
            "content": "Thank you, Antonio. I have several different topics to cover today, so let's jump right in. Let me start with our reported GAAP financial results for the fourth quarter and the full-year fiscal 2022, which are not comparable to the guidance heritage AspenTech provided on its fiscal third quarter earnings call in April, due to the completion of the Emerson transaction and the associated accounting. As previously reported, Emerson acquired a 55% stake in the new AspenTech on May 16, 2022. As such, the subsidiary Emerson set up as part of the transaction, EmerSubCX, which included the DGM and SSC businesses became the surviving entity once the transaction was completed. Therefore, under accounting rules, the GAAP results you see in our press release today reflect the full quarter's results for DGM and SSE and 45 days of results from Heritage AspenTech, reflecting the period from May 16 to June 30. In addition, as part of Emerson, EmerSubCX was on a September 30 fiscal year-end, which changed to June 30 to align with the Heritage AspenTech's fiscal year-end. As a result, you will see that the year-end results shown in our financial tables are for the nine-month period of October 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022 and includes the nine-month fiscal period of DGM and SSC financials and 45 days of Heritage AspenTech. As a result of these adjustments, our income statement and statement of cash flows this quarter and for the full period are not indicative of the financial performance of either Heritage AspenTech or new AspenTech. However, since the balance sheet is a snapshot in time as of June 30, it provides a useful view for investors of our underlying financial strength.  One item I would like to provide further context for is free cash flow in the quarter. The Emerson transaction and resulting change in control required a short period U.S. federal consolidated tax return for the period May 17, 2022 through June 30, 2022. This period was considered a separate tax year and resulted in the recognition of taxable income associated with our contract asset balance. This resulted in a pull-forward of approximately 65 million of cash tax payments into the month of June. Adjusting for this discrete tax payment, and additional transaction related items, free cash flow for the heritage AspenTech business was approximately $286 million in-line with our prior outlook. Due to these unusual circumstances, which will only apply to the fourth quarter of FY 2022 since that is when the transaction closed, as well as the dynamics of our revenue recognition in our model, which I will discuss next. We believe it is more helpful for investors to focus on the key metrics we provide. Now, on to revenue recognition. Our term license financial results are reported under Topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of revenue recognition for our term license contracts. License revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings and more specifically renewal bookings. We define bookings of the total value of customer term license and perpetual SMS contracts delivered in the current period. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years and this non-linearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods, resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. As is common in the software industry, our bookings are typically back-end weighted towards the end of the quarter and the fourth quarter is typically, but not always our largest bookings quarter. As a result, it is not unusual to see resulting revenue decline sequentially in the first fiscal quarter. For [OSI specifically] [ph], license and professional services revenue when sold together in a customer arrangement is generally recognized over time as one performance obligation using percentage of completion accounting. Revenue recognition ends related to license and professional services revenue when implementation is complete. Maintenance revenues recognized ratably for OSI arrangements over the underlying maintenance term and commencing once implementation is complete. As those who have followed us in the past know, we provide supplemental metrics to help investors get a clear sense of the underlying growth of the business. Starting this quarter, we will be transitioning from annual spend to ACV, annual contract value as our primary growth metric. We have posted a slide deck and video presentation on the Investor Relations section of our website to provide greater detail on this change. Historical ACV results going back to the first quarter of fiscal 2020 can be found in our earnings presentation. I encourage all of you to take a look at both. I will not review all the information in that deck on this call, but here are a few key takeaways. We define ACV as an estimate of the annual value of our portfolio term license and term in perpetual software maintenance and support or SMS. agreements. ACV provides insight into the annual growth and retention of our recurring revenue base, which is a large majority of our overall revenue, as well as recurring cash flow. ACV is how we manage the business internally on a day-to-day basis and is the primary corporate performance goal we used to incentivize and compensate our management and sales teams. ACV is functionally very similar to heritage AspenTech's annual spend metric. The only difference between the two metrics is the inclusion of perpetual SMS into ACV. In the near-term, perpetual SMS will continue to increase due to the completion of existing OSI projects underway and the fact OSI will continue to sell some [indiscernible] licenses. As we transition OSI and SSC's businesses to our term license token model, we would expect perpetual SMS ACV to decline. In addition, the small residual amount of perpetual SMS in the heritage AspenTech business will continue to decline. The projected ACV growth and guidance is inclusive of these dynamics. For DGM products, [ACV act] [ph] currently only captures a fraction of their overall business related to term license and perpetual SMS due to the revenue accounting associated with the selling of bundle licenses and service as previously discussed. It does not capture DGM's perpetual licenses, professional services, or hardware revenue. The proportion of DGM revenue that will be represented in ACV is expected to continue to grow over time as we execute on our strategy. The transition to ACV serves a few purposes. The inclusion of perpetual SMS provides greater visibility into DGM and SSE \u2013 current SSE's current recurring revenue streams. It will also provide insight into the ongoing transformation of BGM and SSE's respective business models to AspenTech's tokenized term license model and ACV is a commonly used metric across the software industry and this transition may provide greater comparability for AspenTech with other companies. With that as a background, I would like to spend a moment reviewing ACV in more detail. All growth rates referenced are a year-over-year basis. ACV, which is a snapshot in time and unaffected by the timing of the Emerson transaction, was $791 million at the end of the fourth quarter, up 7.8% year-over-year, breaking that down further, Engineering ACV was $373 million, up 5.5%, MSC ACV was 275 million, up 11.5%, APM ACV was 30 million, up 14%, SSC ACV was 70 million, down 1% and DGM ACV was 43 million, up 19%. Taken together, heritage AspenTech ACV, which includes engineering, MSC, and APM was $678 million, up 8.2%. The difference between this growth rate and the 8.5% annual spend growth rate is the inclusion of approximately $4 million of remaining perpetual SMS and ACV that is slowly declining as the long tail of customers move away from the very old perpetual licenses. Overall, DGM and SSC demonstrated solid performance despite working through sizable integration activities and the distraction of the pending transaction with AspenTech. They have both entered fiscal year 2023 having [been past] [ph] these challenges. Overall, we are pleased with the performance of the business and the significant improvement in growth generated in fiscal year 2023. As Antonio noted, the underlying trends in our core markets are favorable and we are well-positioned to deliver faster growth over time as we execute on our strategic objectives. I would now like to provide some more detail on the progress we have made on the integration of DGM and SSE and how we are tracking against our synergy targets. To build on Antonio's earlier discussion, I'm pleased with our integration and synergy planning process for fiscal year 2023. We have delivered on the critical success criteria for our day one readiness plan. Our fiscal year 2023 plans incorporate the specific contribution from synergy initiatives from both top line growth and expense productivity. We do not plan on providing quarterly updates on our synergy progress, but we do plan on reporting underperformance at the end of the fiscal year. Before I turn to guidance, I would like to discuss our balance sheet and the pending acquisition of Micromine. We ended the quarter with $449.7 million of cash and cash equivalents and $273.6 million of total debt. Our strong balance sheet is a strategic asset for the company and is underpinned by our highly profitable business model with multi-year contracts that are paid annually in advance with yields predictable and sustained cash flow generation. As we highlighted as part of the Emerson transaction, the increased scale and capabilities of the new AspenTech provides a great opportunity to pursue additional acquisitions that broaden our capabilities and market reach. Our recent announcement of our proposed acquisition of Micromine is a great example. Micromine has developed a set of world-class software solutions for the metals and mining industry. Its end-to-end solutions enable miners to digitalize their operations and significantly improve safety sustainability, reliability, and efficiency. Micromine is a great strategic fit for AspenTech and is well aligned with our focus on the dual challenge. The metals and mining industry will be a key strategic enabler of electrification, which will require substantial investments. We are paying [AUD$900 million] [ph] or approximately US$623 million for Micromine, which we expect to close in the second fiscal quarter subject to regulatory approval. We are intending to finance the acquisition through a combination of cash on hand and a new $475 million bridge term loan at the time of closing. We are very comfortable operating with that level of debt on our balance sheet and we will still have available capacity to pursue additional M&A opportunities. I would now like to close with guidance for fiscal year 2023. As Antonio mentioned, our outlook reflects both the strong underlying demand trends we see across the business, as well as a wider range of potential outcomes to reflect the growing uncertainty in the economy. To that end, we are targeting 10.5% to 13.5% ACV growth for fiscal 2023. From a suite perspective, we expect the engineering MSC suites will contribute 6 points to 8 points of growth. DGM will contribute 3 points, SSC 1 point, and APM is expected to contribute approximately 0.5 point to 1.5 points of growth. Attrition is expected to be between 7% and 8% for the year. Note that we do continue expected improvement in heritage \u2013 we do expect continued improvement in heritage AspenTech Nutrition trends in fiscal year 2023, and estimate approximately 3 points to 4 points of attrition. We expect an additional 4 points of attrition from SSC during the fiscal year. We expect minimal attrition from DGM in fiscal 2023. We expect total bookings in the range of $1.07 billion to $1.17 billion, which includes $547 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2023. We expect revenue in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.2 billion. From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $1.186 billion to $1.196 billion. Taken together, we expect GAAP operating income in a range of loss of $46 million to positive $6 million with GAAP net income over a range of negative $8 million to positive $24 million. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of a loss of $0.12 to positive $0.36. From a non-GAAP perspective, we expect total non-GAAP expenses of $637 million to $647 million, non-GAAP operating income of $503 million to $555 million, and non-GAAP income per share in the range of $6.40 to $6.89. As a reminder, our non-GAAP results exclude the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions, and acquisition and integration planning related fees. Note that as a result of the Emerson transaction and the estimated purchase price allocation to intangible assets, fiscal year 2023 results will include a significant increase in the expense related to the amortization of intangibles. This will impact our GAAP profitability. From a free cash flow perspective, we expect free cash flow of $347 million to $362 million. Our fiscal 2023 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payment in the range of $94 million to $104 million. To wrap up, our business is performing at a high level and is well-positioned for the future. We are incredibly excited about the new AspenTech and our ability to deliver even more value for our customers as we help them solve the dual challenge. Operator, we are now ready to take questions. Hi Andrew. Yeah. Yeah. I can definitely give some color to Andrew and then Antonio can come with any extra. So, I would say, we're off to a fantastic start. We have the organization in place. We're clear on roles and engagement. We've had [indiscernible] in meetings. We have geographical trips planned. We have account planning underway. So, I think it's off to an amazing start and I think we're clear with [quotas] [ph] and targets on both sides of the relationships. So, quite excited personally by the speed that we've been moving at. I think that \u2013 so now we have all that, Andrew, I think the results will be more of a Q1 conversation as we're just getting started. The thing I can tell you is that the joint account teams are knowing each other. They're very interested in how they can help each other and that relationship, I think, is off to a great start in Q1. Yes. I think the other thing I would add to is, I think there's going to be a convergence between the markets and our customer. So, very true, what Antonio said from a customer perspective, but the other thing I would add is the markets and how their [indiscernible] is changing. If you read some of the recent articles from some of the banks on [Green CapEx] [ph], you know now we're starting to talk about CapEx as Green CapEx and categorizing it into sustainability things such as electrification, emission, [CCF] [ph]. I think those things will start to converge as our customers decide their inner workings in the sense of who owns those and how they configure it to this [indiscernible]. So, I would just offer that additional context. Thank you."

            "name": "Antonio Pietri",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. I'm excited to welcome you to our first earnings call as a new AspenTech. We're thrilled to have successfully completed our transaction with Emerson during the fourth quarter and to have welcomed the talented teams of OSI and their Digital Grid Management portfolio of products or DGM and the Subsurface Science & Engineering team and their portfolio of products or SSE into AspenTech. This transformative transaction generated significant value for our shareholders and created a leading industrial software company with multiple paths to future long-term value creation for our customers and shareholders. I would like to start by providing an overview of the breadth and scale of our business today before reviewing our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 performance and our outlook for fiscal year 2023. Today, the new AspenTech is one of the world's leading industrial software companies and well-positioned to generate double-digit top and bottom line growth at scale.  We now generate more than $1 billion in annual revenue and nearly $800 million in Annual Contract Value or ACV. The new business growth metric we're introducing this quarter and for which Chantelle will provide more details later in the call. The two businesses contributed by Emerson had leading software solutions that significantly diversified AspenTech's operations and increased our opportunities for growth in new industries and from sustainability investment trends. The [DGM] [ph] portfolio of software solutions and services for the power transmission and distribution or T&D market provides AspenTech a market leading position in a fourth vertical. DGM will benefit from three micro drivers in the T&D market. First, the ongoing upgrading and expansion of the grid as part of global electrification to achieve net zero carbon emissions. Second, the growing complexity of the grid resulting from the introduction of renewable power. And third, the need for improved cybersecurity as the grid is critical infrastructure. These three drivers are catalyst for greater digitalization of the grid to manage larger systems of greater complexity. SSC, formerly known as GSS, is a leading portfolio of software solutions that are highly complementary to our existing upstream business. AspenTech can now provide a set of solutions that add value to the entire lifecycle of an upstream customer's operation by integrating subsurface and above surface modeling and simulation capabilities to unlock additional value in operations. SSC also expands our reach into sustainability areas of the market like carbon capture and sequestration or CCS and geothermal energy. The employees from each company are a strong cultural fit with our heritage business with the same passion for innovation and desire to solve the most complex operational challenges facing our cost customers. The executive leadership team and I have spent significant time with many of the employees of both businesses in recent months and have become even more impressed that we have gotten to know them better. From an integration and transformation perspective, we're tracking well against our plan. We have detailed integration plans for each functional area and for each of the synergy streams, including the cross-selling initiatives between each of the businesses and those associated with the Emerson commercial agreement. We're also making progress recognizing the DGM and SSC product portfolios and converting the DGM portfolio to a term license structure. As we know from our own experience, the [token term] [ph] licensing model will unlock value for our customers and lead to broader and faster adoption of the products in the suite over time. We're pleased with the progress today and feel very good that we will deliver on our target of $110 million of adjusted EBITDA synergies by fiscal year 2026 driven through a combination of ACV growth and cost synergies over time. The benefits of the Emerson transaction extend beyond the DGM and SSC product portfolios. We also formalized our new commercial agreement with Emerson that will make AspenTech solutions available to sell into markets where we have limited presence today such as pharmaceuticals and pulp and paper. Emerson has created a dedicated sales team focused on accelerating adoption of AspenTech products and solutions across a range of these targeted industries and we have established a corresponding team within AspenTech to support and enable Emerson to ensure we capitalize on this significant opportunity. Over time, we will realize additional benefits as more of our products and solutions are integrated into Emerson's industrial systems and as the two organizations identify opportunities for joint innovation that will begin to transform our solutions are delivered to and adopted by customers. In addition, our increased scale and the support of Emerson have expanded our capacity and ability to pursue M&A opportunities. The recent announcement of our definitive agreement to acquire Micromine is a great example. Micromine has developed a great set of software solutions that help metal and mining companies improve their safety, sustainability, reliability, and efficiency of their operations. The metals and mining industry will play a critical role in the energy transition and it's at the very early stages of investing in the digitalization initiative that will enable them to meet that need. We look forward to completing this transaction in our fiscal second quarter, subject to regulatory approval. Finally, the scale of the new AspenTech and its critical role in the capital intensive industries is attracting talent of quality, expertise, and diversity to the company as proven by the members of our new Board of Directors. This injection of new talent will materially benefit the trajectory of this company over many years to come. In addition, as the company scales, we're enhancing a specific organizational capabilities and systems. For example, in our go to market area, we have created an organization focused on the newly expanded set of key industries to sharpen our strategy messaging and go to market execution in each of these industries. We have also expanded our partners organization with the intent to increase our market relationships at a leverage point for market penetration and adoption of our products and solutions. I could not be more excited about what we have built at AspenTech and the opportunity ahead of us. We have assembled one of the most comprehensive set of solutions in the industrial software market and are well-positioned to help our customers address the dual challenge of beating the increasing global demand for resources in a sustainable manner. The dual challenge is central to the continuation of global prosperity and that is why we have made it our mission, as the global population grows by another 2 billion people by 2050. As more and more people expect a better standard of living, and as society expects companies in capital intensive industries to sustainably produce their resources to meet the future needs of the global population, an investment over the next 20 to 30 years of a magnitude that hasn't been seen before in the history of humanity will be required to achieve the complete transformation of the global economy to meet the dual challenge. This investment will focus not only on climate change, but also on circularity, eliminating plastic waste in the environment, and will drive the innovation and deployment of technologies and digital capabilities to achieve these environmental imperatives. We believe the new AspenTech is uniquely positioned to help companies in capital intensive industries meet the dual challenge. With that backdrop, I would like to turn to our fourth quarter and fiscal year results. Since the Emerson transaction closed in mid-May, and June 30 is our fiscal year-end, I will focus my commentary primarily on the heritage AspenTech business. Annual spend for the full-year for the heritage AspenTech business was $674 million, up 2.8% in the quarter and 8.5% year-over-year, which was above the high-end of our guidance range and free cash flow for the full-year for the heritage AspenTech business was approximately $286 million. Please note that this excludes a discrete tax payment associated with the Emerson transaction that Chantelle will discuss in more detail later. We're pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter, which was strong across each of our key verticals and regions. Importantly, we did not see any impact from the worsening economic environment in Q4. The spending environment in our core markets continued to improve as the business and financial performance of our customers has strengthened. After a couple of years of muted investment in their operational excellence and sustainability initiatives, it is clear from transactions closed in the fourth quarter and fiscal year that customers are pursuing more strategic engagements with us and continue the process of standardizing across their operations on our products and solutions to drive greater efficiencies and sustainability gains. Overall, fiscal year 2022 played out much as we hoped it would, which provides us confidence as we enter fiscal year 2023. An important trend that saw acceleration across our business in fiscal year 2022 is how the sustainability imperative is influencing sales activity. Customers across all of our end markets are recognizing the need to step up their focus on sustainability and are putting in place initiatives around emissions reduction, decarbonization, and circularity that will fundamentally change the design, operation, and reliability of their assets in order to meet their sustainability ambitions. Our newly expanded set of solutions will support our customers drive to meet these targets although set by government agencies as a result of the growing regulatory push towards greater environmental disclosure and compliance. As a point of note, a recent webinar held by AspenTech on carbon capture and sequestration garnered a record amount of interest with over 1,900 registrants, a clear indication of the growing focus of our customers on decarbonization and sustainability. Looking at our performance by vertical in the year, Refining had another strong quarter that was the best of the fiscal year. [Crack spreads] [ph] during the fourth quarter were at all-time highs and while they have cooled-off in recent weeks, they remain in the upper quartile of their historical range. We're optimistic about the profitability and demand environment for the refining industry and the growth that it will support for us. Energy security is also leading to a rethink of the medium to long term need for refining capacity in certain parts of the world. Chemicals continues to be a source of strength for our business. Chemical customers recognize that driving greater efficiencies in their operations and mitigating their environmental impact through digitalization is critical to their future business performance. We're also confident about the long-term growth of the industry as global chemical demand is expected to increase 300% by 2050 according to the World Energy Forum placing the industry at the center of meeting the dual challenge as I had previously discussed. The E&C vertical continues on its transformation path as more customers focus on sustainability investments such as renewable power, hydrogen, carbon capture and sequestration and other technologies. This, along with improved medium-term outlook for oil CapEx spend, and an unexpected increase in LNG facilities investments to drive backlog growth for the E&C industry. We're optimistic this vertical will show improvement going forward as it reopens, as it repositions itself towards sustainability and the associated CapEx trends. I would now like to say a few words about the industries in which OSI and SSC operate. Digitalizing the transmission and distribution industry is critical to transforming how this industry operates to support global sustainability, with the DGM portfolio of products perfectly positioned in this regard. It is estimated that energy demand will grow by 50% by 2050 as the global population increases and achieves a better standard of living, which means that to reach net zero carbon emissions in that timeframe, 75% of the increase in energy demand will need to be supplied by electricity and 90% of it will need to come from renewable sources. This means the electrical grid will need to expand significantly and will become more complex, which will require greater and more sophisticated digital capabilities to manage and optimize their operations. This is where OSI and DGM products play a central role. The DGM product portfolio was developed to meet the increasing complexity of the grid, including advanced capabilities such as advanced distribution management systems, ADMS or electricity distribution and distributed energy resource management systems terms, which address a complexity introduced by intermittent sources of electricity into the grid from renewable sources. OSI has also developed capabilities to manage microgrids found in industrial facilities, commercial buildings and other assets or systems that cannot afford the loss of power from public utilities. We also see this application as an important cross-sell opportunity into the heritage AspenTech industrial customer base and furthermore into Micromine's customer base once the transaction closes. Looking ahead, we expect that significant CapEx spend will be dedicated to upgrading and expanding the grid, increasing the demand for DGM solutions for many years to come through all phases of the business cycle. It is important to note that OSI's business is levered through CapEx projects the highly regulated utility industry and not tied to the traditional CapEx investment drivers in oil and gas and chemicals, behaving more like OpEx investments. We're also very excited about the SSC product portfolio in the oil and gas exploration and production area. The integration of the SSE sub surface capabilities with our engineering suite above surface capabilities will create a unique offering in the market. We're already seeing a strong customer interest in this combined offering and its ability to drive innovation in the space. We believe that CapEx budgets in the upstream sector will grow over the next three to five years in order to maintain and increase supply of oil and gas. This is a trend that we already see. Over time, we will create a new path for growth for this portfolio of products focused on decarbonization capabilities and renewable sources of energy such as CCS and geothermal energy, respectively. In addition, existing SSC product capabilities will complement the Micromine suite of products to further differentiate the performance of that future products suite. Finally, we're now the only company able to provide a comprehensive solution to model the entire petroleum value chain from the rock in the reservoir to the distribution of fuel to the corner gas station and into the chemical supply chain. As we typically do on our year-end earnings call, I would now like to provide you with some additional details about our performance for the full-year 2022, all of which are on an annual spend basis. I will start from a product perspective and focus specifically on the performance of the heritage AspenTech businesses. Engineering business grew annual spend 5.5% for the year, generating 38% of our overall annual spend growth. This was stronger than we initially expected and driven in large part by better performance by owner operators, which resulted in lower attrition and higher gross growth. Our manufacturing and supply chain or MSC business delivered annual spend growth of 12.1%, representing 55% of our total annual spend growth. We saw a significant improvement in MSC performance throughout the year as our owner operator customers, particularly refiners saw business conditions improve as COVID-related disruptions abated. The asset performance management or APM business generated total annual strength growth of 14% or 7% of our total annual spend growth for the year contributing 0.6 points of annual spend growth. The performance of the APM suite was impacted by headwinds from attrition, mainly in two areas. One, we had several E&Cs that purchased APM entitlement in the last couple of years as part of their business initiative to generate revenue growth from operations and maintenance activities in brownfield site. The expected revenue growth from this activity did not materialize as a result of depressed demand, due to COVID, so these agreements were not renewed. And two, select customers in Asia and other regions that lacked their on-site support during COVID lockdowns required for the successful deployment of the product. The APM gross growth in the fourth quarter was one of the strongest in the history of the suite. Total gross growth for the suite in fiscal year 2022 equated to 1.1 points of growth. The outlook for APM attrition in fiscal year 2023 is much improved as a result of most E&C contract renewals have been already [up here] [ph] and more mature customer success process, including remote support and expectation of improved demand for this suite going forward. Customer interest remains very high and we continue have a sizable and growing pipeline of opportunities. Shifting to our verticals. The Energy, Chemicals and Engineering construction verticals contributed 54%, 32%, and 7% of our growth in annual spend during the year, respectively. Global Economy Industries or GEIs contributed 7% of our annual spend growth for the year and grew 9% in the year. For the full-year, the attrition rate for heritage AspenTech was 5%. The acceleration in annual spend growth this year was split between lower attrition and higher gross growth. We generated 13.4% gross growth in fiscal year 2022, which was approximately a 200 basis point improvement from last year. We are pleased with the growth performance during the year and believe it sets a stage for further improvement in the years to come. As you can see, we had a strong fiscal year 2022 and enter fiscal year 2023 with a great deal of momentum.  The trends in each of our end markets are positive and the addition of the DGM and SSC product portfolios provide exposure to new markets that are also [trend favorite] [ph]. At the same time, we're mindful of the evolving macroenvironment and its potential to weigh on economic activity in the coming quarters, while also remaining vigilant about future COVID developments and geopolitical considerations. So, while we're optimistic about our performance in fiscal year 2023, we think it's prudent to assume a wider range of potential outcomes. Similar to recent years, we expect fiscal year 2023 to be a tailor to halves. We currently have greater visibility and confidence into the first half of the year given the ongoing strength in our end markets and as customers look to utilize their calendar 2022 budget commitment. Conversely, we see several potential scenarios for customers calendar 2023 budgets depending on how the macro environment evolves in the next two quarters. Putting all these together, our current expectation is for ACV growth in fiscal year 2023 to be 10.5% to 13.5% for new AspenTech. There are several assumptions underpinning our guidance. First, DGM and SSC are expected to contribute approximately 4 points of growth in total this year. The DGM product portfolio has had a good start in the fiscal year, especially considering the sale, acquire, divest processes involving the OSI business for the better part of the last two years.  We're also seeing notable market strength from the SCC product portfolio supported by improved CapEx spend, a better position business after the completion of its restructuring under Emerson ownership, and the potential value creation from the integration of their capabilities with their engineering suite of heritage AspenTech. We're bullish about the outlook for these two product portfolios going forward. Second, we currently expect growth in the first half of fiscal 2023 to build up on the momentum in recent quarters. The current operating outlook for our customers in calendar 2022 is very healthy and support the budget and current spend rates in place. Based on today's macro outlook for oil demand and supply and market dynamics, we expect calendar 2023 budgets to support a continuation of the spend experienced this year, but we prefer to take a prudent approach to our ACV growth range. To put a finer point in the range, the high-end of our range assumes that the DGM and SCC product portfolios will perform as projected in our guidance given the respective market dynamics and the heritage AspenTech product suites will see a continuation of improvement in the spend experienced so far in calendar 2022 into calendar 2023. This outcome assumes little or no impact from any economic deceleration. And the low-end of the range assumes the macro outlook gets materially worse, due to economic conditions, COVID developments and/or geopolitical considerations, resulting in reduced customer spend for the heritage AspenTech suites with owner operators, supporting a growth outcome for those suites similar to fiscal year 2022 was the DGM and SSC product portfolios delivered a performance as projected in our guidance. It's important to note that in any of these scenarios, we're confident that we will deliver a year of double-digit growth in ACV. Third, from a suite perspective, we expect [Engineering and Emerson] [ph] suites will contribute 6 to 8 points of growth, DGM will contribute 3 points, SSC 1 point, and APM is expected to contribute approximately 0.5 points to 1.5 points of growth. Lastly, attrition is expected to be approximately 7% to 8% for the year. The heritage AspenTech attrition is expected to show continued improvement to 3% to 4% for the year, the SSE suite attrition is expected to be approximately 4% for the year, which we would expect to improve in the coming years. DGM is not expected to have any material attrition. While the economic outlook is unclear at the moment, what is clear is that AspenTech is performing at a high level and well-positioned for the future. We meaningfully accelerated growth over the cost \u2013 over the course of fiscal year 2022 and have laid the foundation for durable double-digit growth in the future. The OSI and SSC businesses and the pending acquisition of Micromine provide exciting new growth opportunities and meaningfully diversify our end market exposure. Fiscal year 2022 was the most transformative year in the history of the company. We delivered excellent operational and financial results, while signing and executing our transaction with Emerson. This is the most exciting time in the 40-plus year history of AspenTech and we're well-positioned to deliver greater value than ever before for our customers and shareholders. I want to conclude by recognizing the extraordinary work done by the heritage AspenTech team to deliver the exceptional operational and financial results achieved in fiscal year 2022 and also thank the new AspenTech team for their outstanding effort to continue to make our transformation possible. I strongly believe the best is yet to come and that your efforts will result in significant value creation for all stakeholders of the company. With that, let me turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle? Hi, Matt. Yes. Matt, if you breakdown the guidance that we gave, which is basically at the top of the range is 8.4 heritage AspenTech, or engineering and MSC it is 3 points for DGM 1 point for SSC and 0.5 points to 1.5 points for APM. The growth of heritage AspenTech on an annual spend basis is about 11%. So, the thing is the denominator \u2013 you're looking at a different denominator as well. ACV, we ended the year at $672 million of annual spend.  The ACV base is now 791. So, the numbers are shifting, so it makes it a little harder to estimate, but if you use the same basis for heritage AspenTech, we're projecting our heritage AspenTech business to grow about 11% in fiscal 2023. Yes. Look, I'd like to think that one of our core expertise in AspenTech in old heritage Aspen and new Aspen is execution. We have a very detailed plan around integration and transformation activities, including capturing the synergies we're well into that execution. Micromine is an ongoing business, full blown business with its own organization structure and so on. Once that transaction closes, that business will be able to run on its own with its current management structure, it's our expectation, and will take time to fully integrate it into AspenTech is a business that is accelerating their term licensing business and growth into mining on a global basis. So, while we will work on integrating some of the administrative functions and systems, we'll leave it to run on its own for a period of time. Thank you. Hi, Andrew. Andrew, you might be on mute. Yes. Well, let me look at \u2013 so this is an asset that we've known about for a while. Of course, it's owned by private equity at the moment and it was at that point that the potential, the private equity firm that decided to pick up a process to determine the interest on the asset that we got engaged. It was a fast moving process. Certainly, Emerson's capabilities and expertise contributed to our ability to execute fast and successfully in this. Emerson was fully involved in determining the adequate value and also consent into the funding for the transaction. And then look as far as \u2013 this is pure software technology, so eventually how it integrates into Emerson systems, we'll have to take a look at that like we are and we will about some of our solutions today in the MSC suite, but Emerson has an existing business in a couple of regions for mining. And we believe that it will be certainly \u2013 there will be synergies both to AspenTech and eventually Emerson as a channel for those \u2013 for that software as well. Chantelle, would you like to tackle that first? Great. Thank you. Hi, Jason. You're probably on mute as well, Jason. Yes. I mean, look, so as we stated in the call in the prepared remarks, we saw strong demand for APM in fiscal 2022, about 1.1 points of gross growth. Unfortunately, we did have the set of customers that did not realize the benefit from the use of that software to deliver on projects and then other customers that were under very strict lockdowns over the last 12, 18 months that ended up not successfully deploying the solution. But having said that, we believe that most of that is beyond us. We have a strong pipeline in fiscal 2023 for APM. And in addition, Emerson will be taken to market our APM suite. They have already identified a pipeline of opportunities for APM in different markets and some of them we hope will close this quarter as well. So, overall, we feel good about that suite. Certainly, COVID created different dynamics, but now that we're moving beyond COVID into a more normal environment, we believe that range that we gave for guidance is a comfortable one for that suite. Yes. Look, as we move into new areas, we're taking on a new sets of competitors. While with OSI, it's been more of the traditional industrials in the transmission and distribution business, GE and ABB and Siemens and so on. For Micromine is more pure software players, companies like Bentley, Aveva, Dassault and a couple of other ones. So, we're looking forward to engaging in competitive situations with the software companies. Jason or sorry, you might be on mute again. Yes, no problem. Thank you. Hey, Mark. Yes. Look, Mark, we will come up once the transaction closes with basically a new set of projections for the combined new AspenTech with Micromine, but the revenue will certainly be material. We've always said that anything that we acquire needs to support or be accretive to our double-digit growth ambitions and best-in-class profitability. You can assume that that is the case in this instance that in both metrics that are accretive to our profitability and double-digit growth ambitions. Look, at the end of the day, and by the way, we have an initiative internally to be able to identify opportunities that were driven specifically for sustainability reasons or profitability reasons or both because sometimes, most times is one and the same. We can make our customers profitable and sustainable at the same time with the same products, but look, what it is absolutely true is that almost every conversation with our customers now involves sustainability areas, whether it is how to reduce emissions, how to track emissions, whether it is chemicals recycling, [indiscernible], hydrogen, carbon capture and sequestration, as I mentioned in the call. I mean, we held a seminar two weeks ago. I've been in this company for 26.5 years and I was blown away to hear that we had 1,900 people registered for that webinar, which is unbelievable. So, look, there's no doubt that the sustainability imperative is real. We now saw how the U.S. Senate approved a big sustainability investment and we believe that this will continue to be a trend. More and more companies involved in decarbonization, air carbon capture, electrical batteries. Today, Google and Facebook are customers of AspenTech, new customers, but they are. They're using our engineering suites to model energy consumption in some of their data farms or server farms. So, there's a lot going on in the space and what we're seeing is a new category of customers that are driven mainly by their technology innovation around sustainability. Thank you, Mark. Hi, Patrick. Well, so I assume you're referring to the SSE and OSI businesses, so there's also the commercial agreement and Emerson going to market on their own, reselling our products and solutions. Eventually, Emerson will find new customers through that commercial agreement that where they'll sign up to the suites of heritage AspenTech and those will be token licensing entitlement. And, well that should happen even this quarter and over the next few quarters and years. Look, it takes a few months to set up tokenized products, meaning set up the license management systems and adapt the products so that they can tap into the license management system that ongoing work for both SSC and OSI.  So, our expectation is that the real impact from tokenization will be felt in fiscal 2024 and beyond, but in the meantime, we were taking those products to market as term products, meaning we're trying to sell them on a term basis product-by-product and eventually we'll also compare those customers to full token customers, but our focus right now is on getting everything ready so that late this year, fiscal year and into fiscal 2024, we're in full mode of selling token licenses and really having a business where we've already de-bundled services and license with OSI and we're now already with a lot of momentum in the transformation of these two businesses. Thank you. Well, I want to thank everyone again. This my 40th earnings call as CEO of AspenTech, but it is my first call as CEO of the new AspenTech, very glad to have had this call. We're incredibly excited about the future and what lies ahead for new AspenTech and look forward to engaging you all and with Chantelle as well in future investor conferences and roadshows. So, thank you everyone."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Brian Denyeau. You may begin.\nBrian Denyeau: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 ending March 31, 2022. With me on the call today are Antonio Pietri, AspenTech's President and CEO; and Chantelle Breithaupt, the CFO of AspenTech. Before we begin, I will make the safe harbor statement that during the course of this call, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the Company that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company's actual results may differ materially from such projections or statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's call and contained in our most recently filed Form 10-Q. Also, please note that the following information relates to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, April 27, 2022. Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. The structure of today's call will be as follows. Antonio will discuss business highlights from the third quarter and our pending transaction with Emerson and then Chantelle will review our financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal year 2022. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks, Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. AspenTech's strong third quarter results were driven by further improvement in our key end market and continued strong execution by our sales team with the support of the rest of the organization. As we have mentioned previously, we expected the new budget year for our customers to lead to a better spending environment for AspenTech, considering the positive macro indicators coming into the year. I am pleased to say that this is what occurred during the third quarter. We also remain optimistic about our ability to drive further improvement in annual spend growth over time, considering the continued positive macro environment and growing strategic importance of operational efficiency and sustainability to our customers. We are also excited to be approaching the completion of our proposed transaction with Emerson. The registration statement on Form S-4 has been declared effective by the SEC and we have filed our proxy statement and set a May 16 date for the special meeting of the stockholders to approve the transaction. We believe the combination of our current solutions with innovation and expertise of OSI and Geological Simulation Software will position the new AspenTech to create greater value for our customers, as we help and solve the dual challenge of meeting the increasing global demand for resources in a sustainable manner. We believe our customers can operate sustainably and profitably at the same time. There doesn't need to be a trade-off when you use the right technology. Looking quickly at our financial results in the third quarter, revenue was $187.8 million, GAAP EPS was $1.12 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.38. Annual spend was $655 million, up 2.4% in the quarter and 7.4% year-over-year and free cash flow was $89.2 million. Looking at our third quarter results in more detail. We experienced a strength across each of our key verticals and regions. As I mentioned, the biggest change in the quarter was a notable improvement in customer spending. Our customers\u2019 calendar 2022 budget are much improved, reflecting our expectations after the uncertainty and challenging conditions of the prior two years. We have already seen a positive impact to our sales cycles as a consequence of the ability of customers to engage in more strategic conversations with us and execute on them. We are optimistic this will have a positive impact across all areas of our business as the year progresses. Looking at our performance by vertical. Refining had a particularly strong quarter and its best performance since the pandemic began. Refineries margins improved throughout the quarter and were at the high end of their historical range. As expected, a normalization of the transportation market drove up the demand for fuels and pushed refinery operating rates to historical high levels. The performance in refining over the last two quarters has returned us to the double-digit annual spend growth in the aspenONE MSC suite that we generated consistently for many years pre-COVID. Chemicals continued to generate solid growth and it's an exciting market for us. The industry is increasingly embracing sustainability as an impetus to improve its operational performance while also substantially reducing its environmental footprint. In our conversations with customers, it has become clear that forward thinking companies have recognized greater investment in digitalization can increase their competitive advantage, drive better financial performance and move closer to their sustainability goals. The strong performance of chemicals during the pandemic and the multiple tailwinds benefiting this market gives us confidence in the durability of growth from these customers. The E&C vertical continued to show improvement and delivered positive growth for the second consecutive quarter. The tight supply demand balance for oil resulting in high oil prices along with increased commitment to emissions reductions in the last few years has started to have a positive impact on global energy and sustainability CapEx budgets, respectively. The improved macro outlook for this industry is benefiting AspenTech through improvement in attrition rates, which we now expect to come in modestly better than our previously revised range of 5% to 5.5%. Longer-term, there are three factors that we believe can have a positive impact on our E&C business. The first is expected upcycle in upstream CapEx budgets over the next three to five years necessary to increase oil supply to address future expected growth in demand. The second is the expected acceleration of sustainability CapEx investments and the pivot that many E&C firms are making towards executing projects in low carbon energy areas like hydrogen, carbon capture and sequestration or CCS, biofuels, wind, solar and other areas. We are beginning to see more activity in these areas amongst E&Cs and believe it will become an increasingly significant part of their overall businesses in the coming years. And the third is the growing importance of energy security rooted in oil and gas specifically in the short to medium-term. Recent event have caused a broader reexamination of where energy is being sourced, is being sourced from and the need for diversification of suppliers. We expect this to be a significant catalyst for the global LNG industry in the coming years and a key source of incremental CapEx spend. The improved budget in refining and chemicals and positive trajectory for E&C is resulting in a performance above expectations for the year for our aspenONE Engineering suite. We also remain optimistic about the outlook for our APM business because of the quality and quantity of our pipeline especially as we focus on closing the year. Following our references to a few of the customer transactions closed in the quarter. First, a global chemical company and long-term customer of AspenTech renewed its agreement for all three suites of our products and solutions. This new agreement increased their annual spend by 15% for a total booking value in excess of $70 million making it one of our largest customers. The customer further standardized on additional products, such as Aspen Capital Cost Estimation for the design of new facilities. This company uses AspenTech Solutions to run their operations safer, greener, longer and faster, including for their required reporting on emissions to regulatory authorities. Second, a leading independent player in the European energy and refining industry signed a new agreement to expand its use of our MSC and APM applications. This customer, which operates one of the largest refineries in Europe and the most advanced in terms of plant complexity, decided to increase it's usage after a study by AspenTech personnel, identify tens of millions of dollars in incremental profitability, through operational performance improvements and energy savings and the related reduction in emissions. The deployment of the AspenTech control and optimization solutions in the refinery, including a CO2 emissions dashboard, coupled with expansion of Aspen Mtell to a second \u2013 recently acquired wind farm will be key solutions to help this customer meet its sustainability and profitability objectives. And third and final, a North American electrical vehicles company that manufactures fleet commercial vehicles and SUVs increased its use of the aspenONE Engineering suite to drive collaboration and standardization across production lines in the modeling and manufacturer of electrical cell batteries by the chemical engineers in these teams. The collaboration capabilities of the suite will drive alignment and knowledge sharing across the teams in the multiple production lines as they ramp up vehicle output. In addition to the examples I've reviewed for this quarter, our latest ESG report released in Q3 and available on our website cover several more longer-term examples of our customers are implementing our solutions for sustainability, highlighting the role that digitalization plays in helping companies across diverse industries, reduce waste and energy use and meet their emission targets. Stepping back and looking at our business more broadly. Our recent results reflect the positive impact from an increased customer focus on operational efficiency and sustainability. As we have discussed in the past, the drive towards the automation and digitalization of assets to run them more efficiently and sustainably is still in the relatively early stages and it\u2019s a top investment priority for our customers. In a world of growing demand, rising inflationary pressures and greater scrutiny of the environmental impact of their operations, our customers recognize that being able to do more with less strategic imperative. This was evident in the customer and industry conversations I've had while attending CERAWeek recently. CERAWeek is which is run by IHS Markit and now part of S&P Global is the world's premier energy conference. I've been attending this conference for years and this year, the focus on the need to increase the use of technology to drive efficiency and sustainability was greater than I've ever seen. This is particularly true as it relates to sustainability. Conversations with customers about sustainability are heating an inflection point and it is now part of nearly every meeting we have. In particular, the increased activity by regulatory agencies most notably in Europe, but more recently by the SEC here in the United States about sustainability reporting requirements is driving customers to take a comprehensive view at their strategy in this area. AspenTech is in a great position to benefit from this trend in two ways, driving material amounts of emissions out of customers operations while also making it possible to track their progress in a holistic way. While we are pleased about our performance year-to-date and see the conviction from customers globally about transacting in the current quarter, we also recognized that a degree of uncertainty exists in certain markets for AspenTech, such as Russia and related sanctions and China and the spread of COVID-related lockdowns, which could dampen the growth in the quarter.  The main concern being this customer's ability to get existing business done before the end of the quarter. This leads us to maintain our current annual spend guidance for fiscal 2022 at 7% to 8%. In addition, we are adjusting our fiscal year guidance for attrition to 4.5% to 5% compared to 5% to 5.5% previously. We are also adjusting the guidance for our APM business to 0.75 to 1 point of growth compared to approximately 1 point of growth previously. And finally, we expect to deliver the best-in-class profitability outcome that we guided to for the year and their investors have come to expect from AspenTech. The growing market focus on sustainability especially exciting and we look ahead to the opportunities for the new AspenTech and the capabilities that the OSI and Geological Simulation Software businesses that are being contributed by Emerson will bring. These industry leading solutions are incredibly well positioned to benefit from the expected increase in capital investment in electrification and CCS around the world. We believe our expanded product portfolio will give new AspenTech a unique ability to benefit from the coming decarbonization transition by enabling existing energy and chemical suppliers to operate with higher levels of efficiency and lower emissions than they ever have before to meet current energy and chemical demand, while also capturing the emissions they produce in CCS systems to further decarbonize their production. In addition, we will enable the design of hydrogen production facilities and will optimize their operation once built as countries around the world ramp-up on the utilization of hydrogen as a clean energy source over the coming years and decades. And finally, we will enable the transition to global electrification from clean energy sources by supporting the dramatic increase in power transmission and distribution capacity that is required to meet many of the ambitious sustainability targets that countries and companies have committed themselves to over the next 10 to 30 years. It is important to know that the sustainability imperative is kicking off a massive CapEx investment cycle that will need to continue and increase for the next 30 to 40 years. For example, according to S&P Global, the total CapEx spending in the global energy sector supply side in 2021 was $1.5 trillion. About 30% or $450 billion is spent on low carbon power, which includes hydrogen, CCS, wind, solar and other forms of renewables. 23% of that figure or $104 billion is in transmission and distribution infrastructure. 22% or $99 billion is spent in each of the upstream and on hydro renewable sectors and 33% or approximately $150 billion on solar or photovoltaic power systems. Furthermore, carbon capture and sequestration is estimated to be a $4 trillion market by 2050 according to ExxonMobil as compared to the $6.5 trillion market for oil and gas today that they estimate. What all this says is that going forward, AspenTech will benefit from a major CapEx investment cycle where the products of the new AspenTech will be uniquely positioned to enable our customers to design, operate and maintain these new facilities. We are excited about the future for AspenTech. The plans to integrate the OSI and Geological Simulation Software into the new AspenTech and the commercial agreement that will deepen our partnership with Emerson have grown our conviction for an exciting future. We remain confident in new AspenTech\u2019s ability to be a consistent mid-teens grower with high recurring revenue, best-in-class margin and substantial free cash flow. We are looking forward to completing the transaction as soon as possible and getting to work executing on our strategic plan. Before turning it over to Chantelle, I would like to formally welcome Manish Chawla, who recently joined AspenTech in the newly created position of Chief Revenue Officer, where he will lead all revenue generating functions of the company. Manish joins AspenTech after spending the past 14 years at IBM where he was most recently the Global General Manager of the industrial sector. He's led IBM's effort around energy transition, sustainability and Industry 4.0 and has extensive experiences scaling large global organizations. I am thrilled to welcome Manish to AspenTech's senior leadership team and look forward to his contributions to our success. Manish will be assuming the leadership of our operations team from John Hague, who has decided to retire after 27 years with AspenTech. John will remain in AspenTech until October 1, supported the integration efforts of OSI and GSS and leading the commercial team that will support the Emerson\u2019s sales team taking AspenTech solutions into a number of their key markets. John has been an important and value leader at AspenTech in a number of roles over the years, most recently as EVP of Operations. On behalf of everybody at AspenTech, I want to thank John for all he has done for the company and wish him all the best in his future retirement. I would like to finish by just reiterating how pleased we are with our performance so far in fiscal 2022. We are delivering better than expected growth, high profitability and free cash flow and have made significant progress preparing for the completion of our transaction with Emerson. We believe market trends are clearly in our favor and provide a favorable setup for us to deliver on our long-term financial targets and generate significant value for our shareholders. Now let me turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the third quarter fiscal 2022. As a reminder, these results are being reported under Topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of revenue recognition for our term license contract. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings and more specifically renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years and this nonlinearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods. In our view, annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business and annual free cash flow the most important metric for assessing the overall value our business generates. Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for our term license agreements at the end of each period, was $655 million at the end of the third quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 7.4% on a year-over-year basis and 2.4%, sequentially. Total bookings, which are defined as the total value of customer term license contracts where the associated term licenses were deemed delivered in the quarter under Topic 606, was $207 million, an 18% increase year-over-year. Total revenue was $187.8 million for the third quarter. Turning to profitability beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $93.4 million compared to $77.8 million in the year ago period. The year-over-year increase in GAAP operating expenses were primarily driven by acquisition and integration planning-related expenses associated with our pending transaction with Emerson. Total expenses, including cost of revenue, were $107 million, which was up from $93.8 million in the year ago period. Operating income was $80.8 million and net income for the quarter was $75.1 million or $1.12 per share. Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and integration, planning-related fees, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the third quarter of $102.5 million, representing a 54.6% non-GAAP operating margin compared to a non-GAAP operating income margin of $80.9 million and 49.7%, respectively, in the year ago period. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period to period due to the timing of customer renewals and therefore, license revenue recognized during the quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $92.3 million or $1.38 per share based on 67 million shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with approximately $285 million of cash and cash equivalents and $279 million outstanding under our credit facility. In the third quarter, we generated $81.1 million of cash from operations and $89.2 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software, acquisition and integration planning-related payments. Before turning to guidance, I would like to provide an update on our preparation for the closing of the Emerson transaction and the integration of both OSI and Geological Simulation Software. We have made significant progress in recent months, developing a comprehensive integration plan with detailed timelines and action plans to realize our targeted synergies. We are confident in our ability to deliver on the 110 million of synergies we announced at the time of the transaction. I would now like to close with guidance. Our updated outlook reflects the strong performance year-to-date and improving demand trends we see in many areas of our business. We believe the importance of asset optimization and sustainability are durable growth drivers that will benefit our business for years to come. With respect to annual spend, as Antonio mentioned, we are maintaining our outlook for the year at 7% to 8% growth. We are maintaining our bookings guidance range to $814 million to $840 million, which includes $486 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2022. This includes approximately $191 million of contracts up for renewal in the fourth quarter. Our expected revenue range is now $737 million to $754 million. We now expect license revenue in the range of $513 million to $530 million and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $196 million and $28 million, respectively. From an expense perspective, we now expect total GAAP expenses of $410 million to $415 million. This outlook continues to incorporate our ongoing investments in our go-to-market organization, product development and business units, including APM, AIoT and pharmaceuticals. We expect GAAP operating income in a range of $327 million to $339 million for fiscal 2022, with GAAP net income of approximately $299 million to $310 million. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $4.43 to $4.59. From a non-GAAP perspective, we now expect non-GAAP operating income of $404 million to $416 million and now expect non-GAAP income per share in the range of $5.33 to $5.50. From a free cash flow perspective, we are now targeting free cash flow of at least $285 million. Our updated fiscal 2022 free cash flow guidance still assumes cash tax payments in the range of $60 million to $66 million. Our free cash flow outlook is equivalent to between 42% and 43% of annual spend and highlights our predictable and sustained cash generation. To wrap up, AspenTech delivered strong third quarter results. We are performing well and capitalizing on the market opportunities to generate faster consistent growth. We look forward to completing our transaction with Emerson later this quarter, which we believe will expand our capabilities to create even greater value for our customers and shareholders. Operator, we would now like to begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Good afternoon, Jason.\nJason Celino: Hey, Antonio. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a quick clarification on the guidance because I think you're leaving the full-year annual spend range the same, but I think attrition is a little bit better, but it sounds like APM is \u2013 maybe nominally a little lower. Can you just walk us through kind of the moving pieces there?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I mean, look, certainly, we've captured some of the benefit from the improvement in attrition through the Q3 quarter. Attrition in Q4 will be in line with expectations. Fundamentally, the combination, we still believe that the high end of the range is very achievable and possibly north of that. And that is through the combination of our ongoing performance, MSC, engineering and APM being at the high end of that range. At the same time, like we enumerated in the prepared remarks, while our \u2013 we closed some business in Russia in Q3, there's increasing difficulty from the implementation of sanctions and that could provide a little bit of downside in the quarter. And it's not that the business isn't there, it's just that would take longer to close. And then we're monitoring the lockdowns, the roll out of lockdowns in China, not that the business would disappear, but as we experienced over the last two years, when people are not able to come out of their homes, they're not able to then work on the contracting of these transactions. And they've been already very bureaucratic as it is. So we're just taking a cautious approach here with regards to changing the range, meaning we're not changing and we're living it at 7% to 8%. But at the same time, the same trends that we saw in Q3, we're still seeing in Q4. And for that reason, we decided to maintain our guidance at 7% to 8%.\nJason Celino: Okay. Perfect. That seems fair. And then maybe one last, just housekeeping question. Just so we all have it, but is the vote in May, is that the last kind of hurdle before the deal closes or is there anything else [indiscernible]? Thanks.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Hey, Jason. It\u2019s Chantelle. Nice to hear from you. What I would say in response to, Jason is it's one of the steps required and we'll go through all the steps required before we close.\nJason Celino: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nChantelle Breithaupt: You're welcome.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Oliver of Baird. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Rob.\nRobert Oliver: Great. Hi, Antonio. Hi, Chantelle. Just a couple for me. First Antonio, you mentioned that sales cycles are shortening a bit, and I just wanted to probe for a little bit more color on that. I know you listed some of the drivers for the strong annual spend, but is it emerging from the pandemic? We're seeing more activity levels. Is it people just reacting more briskly to some of the geopolitical and/or price issues and better budgets? And then how do those sales cycles compare to what you've seen historically? And then I had a quick follow-up.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, and that's exactly the point, Rob. The sales cycles are going back to their historical cycle pre-pandemic. They elongated during the pandemic and now there's one, they're going back to their historical level or length, but also they're more predictable. And to us, that's the fundamental difference is a predictability and our ability to close business when we believe it can be closed. And that's been a significant difference in the Q2 and Q3 quarters here. So I do think the spending environment has completely changed. I also think there's been a little bit of pent-up demand, of course, in Q3 after two years of suppressed spending. And we also saw a little bit of business from Q4 move into Q3, which certainly deliver a very strong Q3 quarter for us, but overall much easier environment to be doing business in.\nRobert Oliver: Got it. That's great. And the follow-up for me, and you mentioned, Russia and how that along with China contributed to your thinking relative to maintaining the annual spend guide in Q4 even with the better attrition. So I just wanted to ask on that. So I mean, we've seen \u2013 you guys have a longstanding presence in Russia with a lot of strong relationships, how does this play out? I mean, we're seeing companies like SAP that are abandoning Russia altogether. They're also mission critical for a lot of the companies that they serve. I know you guys are as well. How should we think about, the ultimate risk relative to Russia for you guys? I know you said you even closed the deal there in Q3, but just help us contextualize that if you can? Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I mean, we start with, look, at less than 5% of our annual spend is in Russia and these are five, six year contract. So that 5% is spread over the next five years. Look the \u2013 while our technology is not sanctioned today and we're still doing business there, the environment to do that business has become increasingly more difficult as a result of sanctions in banks that our customers have used for business, banks that our own employees have been using to, for us to pay the \u2013 refund their business expenses. In some cases, a little bit of issue around collections and that's why you see also our free cash flow projection for the year at the midpoint being cautious about potential collection issues in Russia. But having said all that, way in Q3, we did what we thought we could do in the quarter, and we're just being cautious about it. We don't want to get ahead of our skis with respect to Russia or China. Beijing is starting to get into lockdowns. In China, most of the headquarters of the companies we deal with in China are in Beijing. And if these employees are not able to leave their homes, then they're not going to be able to press the button on the SAP system, so to get those agreements done. So just being cautious about it, we haven't really seen any change yet in those markets, but just being cautious.\nRobert Oliver: Great. Thanks very much.\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi.\nAndrew Obin: Yes. Hi, Antonio. Hi, Chantelle. Congratulations. So one of the questions we got a lot today, sort of how do should we think about your cost inflation and what's the dialogue with your customers on pricing beyond your regular business model, if you could just comment on that, and clearly if you're looking at the results, your margins seem to be okay.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, correct. Our margins are very healthy. Let me take the last point. And look, as you are well aware, Andrew, our contracts on average have 2% to 3%, price escalation that historically we talked to customers as being tied to CPI. Over a five or six-year contract, our prices move up 15% to 18% for those customers. So in a way every year, we are increasing prices on our customers, and that allows us to maintain in that regard, the gross margins and profitability for our software business. With regards to personnel inflation, if you will cost inflation of salaries. Look its something that, of course, we're keeping a very close eye on. And we believe our financial discipline, which is also tied to the different levers that we use in the company to compensate and create an attractive rewards program for our employees, will allow us to manage through this. We've hired hundreds of people over the last 12 months into the company. And we continue to bring them in at the price points, the salary points that are in line with the profitability that we will deliver in the future. So overall, we're very confident about our ability to manage through this inflationary period at the moment.\nAndrew Obin: And thank you. And just to follow-up, as you are having \u2013 you're sort of in this unique position. a) You do report, you have a midyear year, but as you're thinking about conversations with your customers for a remainder of calendar 2022, can you just tell us, give us more color as to \u2013 right, because they are on a calendar year budget and you're in your fiscal year budget. How does it look to things accelerate into the calendar year and more importantly, does the nature of your conversation with your customers changing, right, because of going forward, you're going to be closely aligned with Emerson and do these sort of hard way capabilities change, how you interact with your customers and the kind of conversations you're starting to have. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Well, let me look, first of all, since our customers\u2019 fiscal year is the calendar year and the budget is for the calendar fiscal year, the outlook for the rest of the calendar year supported by these strong budgets that they put in place for this calendar year. So we would expect that Q4, Q1 and Q2, meaning the June, September and December quarters are still going to reflect the strength in spending that we saw in this March quarter. And depending on the macro situation towards the end of this calendar year, new budgets for calendar 2023 will dictate the spending environment then. Look, our conversations. Let me just first say the following: we're absolutely convinced that the focus on sustainability and investments in that area are changing the conversations with our customers in a material manner. Now it\u2019s not only we need AspenTech Solutions for profitability purposes, we need AspenTech Solutions for profitability and sustainability reasons. And this is a significant shift by our customers. We started to see it in Europe a year and a half ago is now showing up in the United States and in Asia as well. And we're very bullish about this. With respect to Emerson, absolutely, you see customers that are both users of Emerson and AspenTech and they themselves are thinking about the possibilities from combined solutions between Emerson and AspenTech, how the synergies from the two relationships into that customer and other areas of collaboration, so including co-innovation between customer Emerson and AspenTech to help them address sustainability or operational excellence issues. So we're all very excited about this and that's what we also put it in the prepared remarks. I think it's a very exciting time for AspenTech and the new AspenTech going forward.\nAndrew Obin: Antonio, Chantelle, thanks so much for fitting me in.\nAntonio Pietri: All right. Thank you.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you, Andrew.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt Pfau of William Blair. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Matt.\nMatthew Pfau: Hey. Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Yes. Antonio, it seems like the Engineering and MSC suites are certainly performing ahead of your expectations, but APM maybe a bit below what you\u2019re expecting. Why is APM not seeing the same sort of increase or improvement in traction that MSC and Engineering are?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, I mean, look, first of all, I'm particularly very excited about the quality and quantity of our APM pipeline, frankly. I don't think we've had a better quality pipeline since the beginning of that business. So \u2013 and the quantity it's all there. And probably more \u2013 not probably, certainly more than what we need to deliver on the guidance that we gave you. So having said that, look, I said that there's a little bit \u2013 in my opinion, there was a little bit of pent-up demand in the March quarter because of lack of spending over the last two years. And the easiest thing to do when you want to spend and you really haven't \u2013 you've fallen behind on your automation and digitalization plans is to go with what you know, and the low hanging fruit, which is advanced process control optimization plan in scheduling history and so on. And then you start to focus on new technologies, new areas of technology spending and I think that's APM. So we have a pipeline in Q4 that we're very excited about and we're working to close it. At the same time, look, some of that pipeline is in a couple of the places that we refer to on the call, Russia and China. So we're just being cautious about it as well.\nMatthew Pfau: Makes sense. And then you sort of called out one positive trend going forward could be as people look to diversify their energy suppliers. How do we think about that mechanically in terms of how that impacts Aspen? Is that something that's fairly long-term? And are there any specific areas within your product suite that that benefits more than others?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Matt, in 2019, really towards the end of 2019, beginning of 2020, I was talking to you guys and investors about this wave of CapEx spending in LNG around gas. And that CapEx wave, which was estimated to be about $125 billion over five years sort of dissipated with the pandemic in 2020 and a lot of that investment was put on hold. We believe that certainly the geopolitical situation in Europe around Ukraine is refocusing countries and customers on LNG as an alternative fuel both low carbon, but also a diversification of supplies. And we expect to see that CapEx spend around LNG to get started again and provide lift for our E&C customers initially because these plants and terminals have to be designed first. So that would be the main driver initially, of course, oil will continue \u2013 CapEx in oil will probably continue to increase low to mid single-digit as a result of the need for more oil supply over the next three to five years and that will also be a benefit. But more importantly, LNG CapEx, which in 2019, we were talking about $125 billion over a five-year period.\nMatthew Pfau: Great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Mark Schappel of Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Mark.\nMark Schappel: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. With respect to your prepared remarks Antonio, around customers in China, I was wondering if you just remind us how much of your annual spend comes out of China?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Similarly to Russia, just about 5%.\nMark Schappel: About 5%. Great. Okay. And then switching gears a little bit here, with respect to the pharma business, it's been about a year now since a new General Manager was hired or appointed to that business. Just wondering if you just give us an update, what you're seeing there?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. I mean, look, pharma certainly it's an opportunity for us and a lot of the work that was put in place when he first joined, but this time last year was an investment in R&D that will start to bear fruit later this year in our next release of software in November. And then our go-to-market activities sort of organically around that, we continue to execute. Again, pharma, materially to our overall results is not there yet. But we're still optimistic. But we've also said that we would like to make a sort of an acquisition to have an anchor tenant in pharma as well. And that's something that we haven't been able to execute on, but we continue to see what opportunities are in the market. But yes, pharma continues in its trajectory and it\u2019s something that we're still focused on, so\u2026\nMark Schappel: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Again, ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back over to CEO, Antonio Pietri, for closing remarks.\nAntonio Pietri: All right. Well, thank you, operator, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to actually attending a few of the investor conferences in person this quarter and meeting with some of you as well in person and the call backs that we will have. Thank you to everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

With respect to annual spend, as Antonio mentioned, we are maintaining our outlook for the year at 7% to 8% growth. We are maintaining our bookings guidance range to $814 million to $840 million, which includes $486 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2022. This includes approximately $191 million of contracts up for renewal in the fourth quarter. Our expected revenue range is now $737 million to $754 million. We now expect license revenue in the range of $513 million to $530 million and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $196 million and $28 million, respectively. From an expense perspective, we now expect total GAAP expenses of $410 million to $415 million. This outlook continues to incorporate our ongoing investments in our go-to-market organization, product development and business units, including APM, AIoT and pharmaceuticals. We expect GAAP operating income in a range of $327 million to $339 million for fiscal 2022, with GAAP net income of approximately $299 million to $310 million. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $4.43 to $4.59. From a non-GAAP perspective, we now expect non-GAAP operating income of $404 million to $416 million and now expect non-GAAP income per share in the range of $5.33 to $5.50. From a free cash flow perspective, we are now targeting free cash flow of at least $285 million. Our updated fiscal 2022 free cash flow guidance still assumes cash tax payments in the range of $60 million to $66 million. Our free cash flow outlook is equivalent to between 42% and 43% of annual spend and highlights our predictable and sustained cash generation. To wrap up, AspenTech delivered strong third quarter results. We are performing well and capitalizing on the market opportunities to generate faster consistent growth. We look forward to completing our transaction with Emerson later this quarter, which we believe will expand our capabilities to create even greater value for our customers and shareholders. Operator, we would now like to begin the Q&A. Hey, Jason. It's Chantelle. Nice to hear from you. What I would say in response to, Jason is it's one of the steps required and we'll go through all the steps required before we close. You're welcome. Thank you, Andrew."

            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. AspenTech's strong third quarter results were driven by further improvement in our key end market and continued strong execution by our sales team with the support of the rest of the organization. As we have mentioned previously, we expected the new budget year for our customers to lead to a better spending environment for AspenTech, considering the positive macro indicators coming into the year. I am pleased to say that this is what occurred during the third quarter. We also remain optimistic about our ability to drive further improvement in annual spend growth over time, considering the continued positive macro environment and growing strategic importance of operational efficiency and sustainability to our customers. We are also excited to be approaching the completion of our proposed transaction with Emerson. The registration statement on Form S-4 has been declared effective by the SEC and we have filed our proxy statement and set a May 16 date for the special meeting of the stockholders to approve the transaction. We believe the combination of our current solutions with innovation and expertise of OSI and Geological Simulation Software will position the new AspenTech to create greater value for our customers, as we help and solve the dual challenge of meeting the increasing global demand for resources in a sustainable manner. We believe our customers can operate sustainably and profitably at the same time. There doesn't need to be a trade-off when you use the right technology. Looking quickly at our financial results in the third quarter, revenue was $187.8 million, GAAP EPS was $1.12 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.38. Annual spend was $655 million, up 2.4% in the quarter and 7.4% year-over-year and free cash flow was $89.2 million. Looking at our third quarter results in more detail. We experienced a strength across each of our key verticals and regions. As I mentioned, the biggest change in the quarter was a notable improvement in customer spending. Our customers' calendar 2022 budget are much improved, reflecting our expectations after the uncertainty and challenging conditions of the prior two years. We have already seen a positive impact to our sales cycles as a consequence of the ability of customers to engage in more strategic conversations with us and execute on them. We are optimistic this will have a positive impact across all areas of our business as the year progresses. Looking at our performance by vertical. Refining had a particularly strong quarter and its best performance since the pandemic began. Refineries margins improved throughout the quarter and were at the high end of their historical range. As expected, a normalization of the transportation market drove up the demand for fuels and pushed refinery operating rates to historical high levels. The performance in refining over the last two quarters has returned us to the double-digit annual spend growth in the aspenONE MSC suite that we generated consistently for many years pre-COVID. Chemicals continued to generate solid growth and it's an exciting market for us. The industry is increasingly embracing sustainability as an impetus to improve its operational performance while also substantially reducing its environmental footprint. In our conversations with customers, it has become clear that forward thinking companies have recognized greater investment in digitalization can increase their competitive advantage, drive better financial performance and move closer to their sustainability goals. The strong performance of chemicals during the pandemic and the multiple tailwinds benefiting this market gives us confidence in the durability of growth from these customers. The E&C vertical continued to show improvement and delivered positive growth for the second consecutive quarter. The tight supply demand balance for oil resulting in high oil prices along with increased commitment to emissions reductions in the last few years has started to have a positive impact on global energy and sustainability CapEx budgets, respectively. The improved macro outlook for this industry is benefiting AspenTech through improvement in attrition rates, which we now expect to come in modestly better than our previously revised range of 5% to 5.5%. Longer-term, there are three factors that we believe can have a positive impact on our E&C business. The first is expected upcycle in upstream CapEx budgets over the next three to five years necessary to increase oil supply to address future expected growth in demand. The second is the expected acceleration of sustainability CapEx investments and the pivot that many E&C firms are making towards executing projects in low carbon energy areas like hydrogen, carbon capture and sequestration or CCS, biofuels, wind, solar and other areas. We are beginning to see more activity in these areas amongst E&Cs and believe it will become an increasingly significant part of their overall businesses in the coming years. And the third is the growing importance of energy security rooted in oil and gas specifically in the short to medium-term. Recent event have caused a broader reexamination of where energy is being sourced, is being sourced from and the need for diversification of suppliers. We expect this to be a significant catalyst for the global LNG industry in the coming years and a key source of incremental CapEx spend. The improved budget in refining and chemicals and positive trajectory for E&C is resulting in a performance above expectations for the year for our aspenONE Engineering suite. We also remain optimistic about the outlook for our APM business because of the quality and quantity of our pipeline especially as we focus on closing the year. Following our references to a few of the customer transactions closed in the quarter. First, a global chemical company and long-term customer of AspenTech renewed its agreement for all three suites of our products and solutions. This new agreement increased their annual spend by 15% for a total booking value in excess of $70 million making it one of our largest customers. The customer further standardized on additional products, such as Aspen Capital Cost Estimation for the design of new facilities. This company uses AspenTech Solutions to run their operations safer, greener, longer and faster, including for their required reporting on emissions to regulatory authorities. Second, a leading independent player in the European energy and refining industry signed a new agreement to expand its use of our MSC and APM applications. This customer, which operates one of the largest refineries in Europe and the most advanced in terms of plant complexity, decided to increase it's usage after a study by AspenTech personnel, identify tens of millions of dollars in incremental profitability, through operational performance improvements and energy savings and the related reduction in emissions. The deployment of the AspenTech control and optimization solutions in the refinery, including a CO2 emissions dashboard, coupled with expansion of Aspen Mtell to a second \u2013 recently acquired wind farm will be key solutions to help this customer meet its sustainability and profitability objectives. And third and final, a North American electrical vehicles company that manufactures fleet commercial vehicles and SUVs increased its use of the aspenONE Engineering suite to drive collaboration and standardization across production lines in the modeling and manufacturer of electrical cell batteries by the chemical engineers in these teams. The collaboration capabilities of the suite will drive alignment and knowledge sharing across the teams in the multiple production lines as they ramp up vehicle output. In addition to the examples I've reviewed for this quarter, our latest ESG report released in Q3 and available on our website cover several more longer-term examples of our customers are implementing our solutions for sustainability, highlighting the role that digitalization plays in helping companies across diverse industries, reduce waste and energy use and meet their emission targets. Stepping back and looking at our business more broadly. Our recent results reflect the positive impact from an increased customer focus on operational efficiency and sustainability. As we have discussed in the past, the drive towards the automation and digitalization of assets to run them more efficiently and sustainably is still in the relatively early stages and it's a top investment priority for our customers. In a world of growing demand, rising inflationary pressures and greater scrutiny of the environmental impact of their operations, our customers recognize that being able to do more with less strategic imperative. This was evident in the customer and industry conversations I've had while attending CERAWeek recently. CERAWeek is which is run by IHS Markit and now part of S&P Global is the world's premier energy conference. I've been attending this conference for years and this year, the focus on the need to increase the use of technology to drive efficiency and sustainability was greater than I've ever seen. This is particularly true as it relates to sustainability. Conversations with customers about sustainability are heating an inflection point and it is now part of nearly every meeting we have. In particular, the increased activity by regulatory agencies most notably in Europe, but more recently by the SEC here in the United States about sustainability reporting requirements is driving customers to take a comprehensive view at their strategy in this area. AspenTech is in a great position to benefit from this trend in two ways, driving material amounts of emissions out of customers operations while also making it possible to track their progress in a holistic way. While we are pleased about our performance year-to-date and see the conviction from customers globally about transacting in the current quarter, we also recognized that a degree of uncertainty exists in certain markets for AspenTech, such as Russia and related sanctions and China and the spread of COVID-related lockdowns, which could dampen the growth in the quarter.  The main concern being this customer's ability to get existing business done before the end of the quarter. This leads us to maintain our current annual spend guidance for fiscal 2022 at 7% to 8%. In addition, we are adjusting our fiscal year guidance for attrition to 4.5% to 5% compared to 5% to 5.5% previously. We are also adjusting the guidance for our APM business to 0.75 to 1 point of growth compared to approximately 1 point of growth previously. And finally, we expect to deliver the best-in-class profitability outcome that we guided to for the year and their investors have come to expect from AspenTech. The growing market focus on sustainability especially exciting and we look ahead to the opportunities for the new AspenTech and the capabilities that the OSI and Geological Simulation Software businesses that are being contributed by Emerson will bring. These industry leading solutions are incredibly well positioned to benefit from the expected increase in capital investment in electrification and CCS around the world. We believe our expanded product portfolio will give new AspenTech a unique ability to benefit from the coming decarbonization transition by enabling existing energy and chemical suppliers to operate with higher levels of efficiency and lower emissions than they ever have before to meet current energy and chemical demand, while also capturing the emissions they produce in CCS systems to further decarbonize their production. In addition, we will enable the design of hydrogen production facilities and will optimize their operation once built as countries around the world ramp-up on the utilization of hydrogen as a clean energy source over the coming years and decades. And finally, we will enable the transition to global electrification from clean energy sources by supporting the dramatic increase in power transmission and distribution capacity that is required to meet many of the ambitious sustainability targets that countries and companies have committed themselves to over the next 10 to 30 years. It is important to know that the sustainability imperative is kicking off a massive CapEx investment cycle that will need to continue and increase for the next 30 to 40 years. For example, according to S&P Global, the total CapEx spending in the global energy sector supply side in 2021 was $1.5 trillion. About 30% or $450 billion is spent on low carbon power, which includes hydrogen, CCS, wind, solar and other forms of renewables. 23% of that figure or $104 billion is in transmission and distribution infrastructure. 22% or $99 billion is spent in each of the upstream and on hydro renewable sectors and 33% or approximately $150 billion on solar or photovoltaic power systems. Furthermore, carbon capture and sequestration is estimated to be a $4 trillion market by 2050 according to ExxonMobil as compared to the $6.5 trillion market for oil and gas today that they estimate. What all this says is that going forward, AspenTech will benefit from a major CapEx investment cycle where the products of the new AspenTech will be uniquely positioned to enable our customers to design, operate and maintain these new facilities. We are excited about the future for AspenTech. The plans to integrate the OSI and Geological Simulation Software into the new AspenTech and the commercial agreement that will deepen our partnership with Emerson have grown our conviction for an exciting future. We remain confident in new AspenTech's ability to be a consistent mid-teens grower with high recurring revenue, best-in-class margin and substantial free cash flow. We are looking forward to completing the transaction as soon as possible and getting to work executing on our strategic plan. Before turning it over to Chantelle, I would like to formally welcome Manish Chawla, who recently joined AspenTech in the newly created position of Chief Revenue Officer, where he will lead all revenue generating functions of the company. Manish joins AspenTech after spending the past 14 years at IBM where he was most recently the Global General Manager of the industrial sector. He's led IBM's effort around energy transition, sustainability and Industry 4.0 and has extensive experiences scaling large global organizations. I am thrilled to welcome Manish to AspenTech's senior leadership team and look forward to his contributions to our success. Manish will be assuming the leadership of our operations team from John Hague, who has decided to retire after 27 years with AspenTech. John will remain in AspenTech until October 1, supported the integration efforts of OSI and GSS and leading the commercial team that will support the Emerson's sales team taking AspenTech solutions into a number of their key markets. John has been an important and value leader at AspenTech in a number of roles over the years, most recently as EVP of Operations. On behalf of everybody at AspenTech, I want to thank John for all he has done for the company and wish him all the best in his future retirement. I would like to finish by just reiterating how pleased we are with our performance so far in fiscal 2022. We are delivering better than expected growth, high profitability and free cash flow and have made significant progress preparing for the completion of our transaction with Emerson. We believe market trends are clearly in our favor and provide a favorable setup for us to deliver on our long-term financial targets and generate significant value for our shareholders. Now let me turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle? Good afternoon, Jason. Well, I mean, look, certainly, we've captured some of the benefit from the improvement in attrition through the Q3 quarter. Attrition in Q4 will be in line with expectations. Fundamentally, the combination, we still believe that the high end of the range is very achievable and possibly north of that. And that is through the combination of our ongoing performance, MSC, engineering and APM being at the high end of that range. At the same time, like we enumerated in the prepared remarks, while our \u2013 we closed some business in Russia in Q3, there's increasing difficulty from the implementation of sanctions and that could provide a little bit of downside in the quarter. And it's not that the business isn't there, it's just that would take longer to close. And then we're monitoring the lockdowns, the roll out of lockdowns in China, not that the business would disappear, but as we experienced over the last two years, when people are not able to come out of their homes, they're not able to then work on the contracting of these transactions. And they've been already very bureaucratic as it is. So we're just taking a cautious approach here with regards to changing the range, meaning we're not changing and we're living it at 7% to 8%. But at the same time, the same trends that we saw in Q3, we're still seeing in Q4. And for that reason, we decided to maintain our guidance at 7% to 8%. Thank you. Hi, Rob. Yes. Well, and that's exactly the point, Rob. The sales cycles are going back to their historical cycle pre-pandemic. They elongated during the pandemic and now there's one, they're going back to their historical level or length, but also they're more predictable. And to us, that's the fundamental difference is a predictability and our ability to close business when we believe it can be closed. And that's been a significant difference in the Q2 and Q3 quarters here. So I do think the spending environment has completely changed. I also think there's been a little bit of pent-up demand, of course, in Q3 after two years of suppressed spending. And we also saw a little bit of business from Q4 move into Q3, which certainly deliver a very strong Q3 quarter for us, but overall much easier environment to be doing business in. Well, I mean, we start with, look, at less than 5% of our annual spend is in Russia and these are five, six year contract. So that 5% is spread over the next five years. Look the \u2013 while our technology is not sanctioned today and we're still doing business there, the environment to do that business has become increasingly more difficult as a result of sanctions in banks that our customers have used for business, banks that our own employees have been using to, for us to pay the \u2013 refund their business expenses. In some cases, a little bit of issue around collections and that's why you see also our free cash flow projection for the year at the midpoint being cautious about potential collection issues in Russia. But having said all that, way in Q3, we did what we thought we could do in the quarter, and we're just being cautious about it. We don't want to get ahead of our skis with respect to Russia or China. Beijing is starting to get into lockdowns. In China, most of the headquarters of the companies we deal with in China are in Beijing. And if these employees are not able to leave their homes, then they're not going to be able to press the button on the SAP system, so to get those agreements done. So just being cautious about it, we haven't really seen any change yet in those markets, but just being cautious. Thanks. Hi. Yes, correct. Our margins are very healthy. Let me take the last point. And look, as you are well aware, Andrew, our contracts on average have 2% to 3%, price escalation that historically we talked to customers as being tied to CPI. Over a five or six-year contract, our prices move up 15% to 18% for those customers. So in a way every year, we are increasing prices on our customers, and that allows us to maintain in that regard, the gross margins and profitability for our software business. With regards to personnel inflation, if you will cost inflation of salaries. Look its something that, of course, we're keeping a very close eye on. And we believe our financial discipline, which is also tied to the different levers that we use in the company to compensate and create an attractive rewards program for our employees, will allow us to manage through this. We've hired hundreds of people over the last 12 months into the company. And we continue to bring them in at the price points, the salary points that are in line with the profitability that we will deliver in the future. So overall, we're very confident about our ability to manage through this inflationary period at the moment. Well, let me look, first of all, since our customers' fiscal year is the calendar year and the budget is for the calendar fiscal year, the outlook for the rest of the calendar year supported by these strong budgets that they put in place for this calendar year. So we would expect that Q4, Q1 and Q2, meaning the June, September and December quarters are still going to reflect the strength in spending that we saw in this March quarter. And depending on the macro situation towards the end of this calendar year, new budgets for calendar 2023 will dictate the spending environment then. Look, our conversations. Let me just first say the following: we're absolutely convinced that the focus on sustainability and investments in that area are changing the conversations with our customers in a material manner. Now it's not only we need AspenTech Solutions for profitability purposes, we need AspenTech Solutions for profitability and sustainability reasons. And this is a significant shift by our customers. We started to see it in Europe a year and a half ago is now showing up in the United States and in Asia as well. And we're very bullish about this. With respect to Emerson, absolutely, you see customers that are both users of Emerson and AspenTech and they themselves are thinking about the possibilities from combined solutions between Emerson and AspenTech, how the synergies from the two relationships into that customer and other areas of collaboration, so including co-innovation between customer Emerson and AspenTech to help them address sustainability or operational excellence issues. So we're all very excited about this and that's what we also put it in the prepared remarks. I think it's a very exciting time for AspenTech and the new AspenTech going forward. All right. Thank you. Hi, Matt. Yes. Well, I mean, look, first of all, I'm particularly very excited about the quality and quantity of our APM pipeline, frankly. I don't think we've had a better quality pipeline since the beginning of that business. So \u2013 and the quantity it's all there. And probably more \u2013 not probably, certainly more than what we need to deliver on the guidance that we gave you. So having said that, look, I said that there's a little bit \u2013 in my opinion, there was a little bit of pent-up demand in the March quarter because of lack of spending over the last two years. And the easiest thing to do when you want to spend and you really haven't \u2013 you've fallen behind on your automation and digitalization plans is to go with what you know, and the low hanging fruit, which is advanced process control optimization plan in scheduling history and so on. And then you start to focus on new technologies, new areas of technology spending and I think that's APM. So we have a pipeline in Q4 that we're very excited about and we're working to close it. At the same time, look, some of that pipeline is in a couple of the places that we refer to on the call, Russia and China. So we're just being cautious about it as well. Yes. Matt, in 2019, really towards the end of 2019, beginning of 2020, I was talking to you guys and investors about this wave of CapEx spending in LNG around gas. And that CapEx wave, which was estimated to be about $125 billion over five years sort of dissipated with the pandemic in 2020 and a lot of that investment was put on hold. We believe that certainly the geopolitical situation in Europe around Ukraine is refocusing countries and customers on LNG as an alternative fuel both low carbon, but also a diversification of supplies. And we expect to see that CapEx spend around LNG to get started again and provide lift for our E&C customers initially because these plants and terminals have to be designed first. So that would be the main driver initially, of course, oil will continue \u2013 CapEx in oil will probably continue to increase low to mid single-digit as a result of the need for more oil supply over the next three to five years and that will also be a benefit. But more importantly, LNG CapEx, which in 2019, we were talking about $125 billion over a five-year period. Thank you. Hi, Mark. Yes. Similarly to Russia, just about 5%. Yes. I mean, look, pharma certainly it's an opportunity for us and a lot of the work that was put in place when he first joined, but this time last year was an investment in R&D that will start to bear fruit later this year in our next release of software in November. And then our go-to-market activities sort of organically around that, we continue to execute. Again, pharma, materially to our overall results is not there yet. But we're still optimistic. But we've also said that we would like to make a sort of an acquisition to have an anchor tenant in pharma as well. And that's something that we haven't been able to execute on, but we continue to see what opportunities are in the market. But yes, pharma continues in its trajectory and it's something that we're still focused on, so... All right. Well, thank you, operator, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. We look forward to actually attending a few of the investor conferences in person this quarter and meeting with some of you as well in person and the call backs that we will have. Thank you to everyone."

Welcome to the Aspen Technology\u2019s Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now like to hand the conference over to Brian Denyeau from ICR. Please go ahead.\nBrian Denyeau: 00:41 Thank you. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 ending December 31, 2021. With me on the call today are Antonio Pietri, Aspen Tech's President and CEO; and Chantelle Breithaupt, CFO of Aspen Tech. 00:59 Before we begin, I will make the Safe Harbor statement that during the course of this call, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from such projections or statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed in today's call and contained in our most recently filed Form 10-Q. 01:24 Also, please note that the following information relates to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, January 26, 2022. Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. The structure of today's call will be as follows; Antonio will discuss business highlights from the second quarter and our pending agreement with Emerson, and then Chantelle will review our financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal year 2022. 01:51 With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: 01:56 Thanks, Brian. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We delivered strong second quarter results that reflect continued improvement in the spending environment and good execution by our team. Our second quarter performance reinforces our belief in the strategic importance to customers of enhancing the operational efficiency and sustainability of their assets. 02:24 We\u2019re now seeing this customer trend materialize in better growth as market conditions have normalized. While not all the way to back to pre-COVID levels, market conditions are moving concretely in the right direction for Aspen Tech. We\u2019re confident this will continue to support improved annual spend growth across our business over time. 02:49 We\u2019ve also made significant progress towards completing the proposed transaction with Emerson, which remains on track to close during our fourth fiscal quarter. As we\u2019ve gotten to know the Emerson businesses better, we\u2019re continually impressed by the team and their culture. 03:09 Since the announcement, we've also received more and more positive feedback from customers in a number of industries about their enthusiasm for the transaction. Given all of this, we're even more excited about the transformational opportunity the new Aspen Tech has in current and new verticals, as well as in sustainability, allowing for increased value creation opportunities for both our customers and shareholders. 03:38 Looking quickly at our financial results in the second quarter, revenue was $171.4 million, GAAP EPS was $0.92, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.20. Annual spend was $640 million, up 1.7% in the quarter and 6% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $51.9 million. 04:09 Looking at the second quarter in more detail, one of the key areas of improvement was the normalization of transaction closing cycles, which are now back to pre-pandemic cycle times. I'm pleased at how our sales organization has navigated these changes in recent quarters. 04:27 In terms of vertical performance, expanding by our refining customers saw notable improvement for the second consecutive quarter. As we have discussed in the past, refining has been a consistent source of a strength for Aspen Tech as our solutions are critical to delivering on the short-term and long-term operational and sustainability priorities of our customers. 04:52 During the second half of calendar 2021, refining margins improved meaningfully and trended back to their historical range ending up on a strong note in December. We're also encouraged by the fact that the Omicron variant has not reduced fuel demand for transportation, despite causing record numbers of COVID cases, with low inventories for diesel and jet fuel now being reported. 05:21 The performance of our refining customers in the first half of the fiscal year gives us confidence that this vertical will support the MSC business returning to consistent double-digit annual spend growth, assuming a stronger budget and spending in calendar 2022. 05:40 Chemicals, once again had a solid quarter and has been the most consistent vertical over the past two years. Within chemicals, there continue to be some areas that face supply chain constraints, but overall, we've had consistently good conversations with customers under future investment priorities. 06:00 We believe there are exciting opportunities for growth in this market and that Aspen Tech will continue to be an important partner to our customers as they drive operational excellence and transition to a more sustainable future, which for them means lower emissions, as well as circularity. 06:21 The positive results from our refining and chemicals customers drove better than expected performance for our engineering and MSC suites, which are ahead of plan for the first half of the fiscal year. 06:34 The EMC industry performed better than expected delivering a slightly positive growth quarter. The market dynamics affecting this industry have largely stabilized and backlog trends have shown modest positive improvements in the first half of the year. 06:50 Importantly, attrition amongst these customers has been tracking marginally better than expectations and we're optimistic about our ability to forecast this metric. This is a critical first step towards improved demand and a return to a stronger positive annual spend growth. 07:08 While we do not expect the E&C sector to be a primary growth driver for our business short-term, we're encouraged by deceleration in final investment decisions, FIDs, for LNG projects and in the oil and gas sector in the Middle East region, as well as expected increase in global oil and gas CapEx in calendar 2022. 07:32 In addition, the shift in their focus towards sustainability investments will help accelerate their recovery as increasingly CapEx spend will be driven by hydrogen projects carbon capture and sequestration, biofuels, wind, solar, and other projects. We believe this will drive E&C customers to be greater contributors to our long term growth target than they are today. 07:58 Finally, I would like to provide an update on our APM suite. We're beginning to see some improvement in demand conversion in this area of the business as customers increase OpEx spend on maintenance and reliability in facilities where a lot of this work was postponed throughout the pandemic. 08:17 As we have discussed during the same period of the pandemic, interest and demand for our APM solutions have been strong with consistent growth in customer engagement pipeline and pilots. Through the first half of the year, APM contributed 0.28 points of annual spend growth, just under our first half year plan. 08:41 We believe the suite is well-positioned to benefit from increased spending and contribute approximately 1 point of annual spend growth in fiscal 2022. We're also confident that our pandemic tested APM business will be better positioned for growth longer-term. 09:00 Following are references to a few of the customer transactions closed in the quarter: First, our U.S. Headquarter engineering firm, a customer for close to 15 years increased its spend with Aspen Tech now that its business outlook is improving after having reviews, its software license entitlement at renewal at the beginning of the pandemic. After conducting a thorough analysis of the market, including competitive offerings, the customer increased its commitment to the suite. 09:32 The availability in the suite of Aspen Tech\u2019s ACCE product for Capital Cost Estimation was fundamental in the decision because the customer is in the process of reconstituting its capital cost estimation team that has been dismantled at the beginning of the pandemic and its functionality is not available in the market from other competitors. 09:55 Second, a European energy and petrochemical company and long-term user of our multivariable control technology in refining and chemicals decided to standardize all operating assets on our Aspen DMC3 multivariable control technology through an enterprise license agreement. 10:16 Two main reasons supported their decision: The operational improvement on value created by the technology; and the customers\u2019 focus on energy efficiency and emissions reduction as part of our commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. 10:34 Third, a refining customer [in Asia] [ph] conducted an extensive evaluation of asset predictive maintenance solutions, including Aspen Anto. The customer selected Aspen Anto on the basis of its technical capabilities and ease of implementation. 10:54 The acquisition of an APM solution support the planned digitalization of the customer's maintenance functional area. It is expected that Aspen Anto will be rolled out to multiple units and equipment in the refinery and in-time expanded to other refineries. 11:34 Operator, are you able to listen to us? Okay. Operator, are we back?\nOperator: 11:40 Yes, you are live, sir.\nAntonio Pietri: 11:43 Okay. Thank you. We lost our network connection here in the office. So, let me get back to the \u2013 is audience able to hear me?\nOperator: 11:54 Yes, sir.\nAntonio Pietri: 11:56 Okay, great. Let me get back to our customer references. Third, a refining customer [in Asia] [ph] conducted an extensive evaluation of asset predictive maintenance solutions, including Aspen Anto. The customer selected Aspen Anto on the basis of its technical capabilities and ease of implementation. The acquisition of an APM solution supports the planned digitalization of the customer's maintenance functional area. 12:25 It is expected that Aspen Anto will be rolled out to multiple units and equipment in the refinery and in time expanded to other refiners. Fourth and final, a Northern Europe independent refiner, recently formed from the acquisition of assets divested by one of the major oil companies sought to upgrade the optimization technologies in the refinery to increase profitability and reduce emissions as part of the customers and host countries commitment to net zero carbon emissions. 13:00 After a detailed analysis of the value capture opportunity, which was determined to be greater than $75 million per year and the estimation of the expected reduction in emissions, the customer committed to a site license for the Aspen DMC3 multivariable control technology and the Aspen GDOT multi-unit optimization technology in the MSC suite. This agreement was signed in a three month sales cycle. 13:31 I point out that in two of the highlighted transactions, the customers requested enterprise license agreements to deploy certain solutions across the entire asset base. We're encouraged by these examples of customers preparing comprehensive agreements to deploy solutions that are critical to their sustainability initiatives. It's important to note that these agreements are still a structure as part of our token based licensing model. 14:02 As we look to the second half of the fiscal year and calendar 2022, we're encouraged by the recent trends in key macro indicators for our business. Oil demand, while not yet at pre-pandemic levels has exceeded growth expectations. Oil prices in the range of $75 to $85 per barrel and an equally strong or stronger outlook for calendar 2022. 14:33 Refining margins back in the historical range with the industry expectations for acceleration in fuels consumption and is strengthening margins in 2022. Chemical demand and margins expected to remain strong in calendar 2022. 14:51 CapEx spending in oil and gas and chemicals is expected to increase by double-digits with CapEx spend in hydrogen carbon capture and sequestration and biofuels projects experiencing significant increases as sustainability investments accelerate. And software spend in our customer base projected to increase 10% to 15% based on customer surveys we conducted late last year. 15:20 All of these leads to our expectation of solid increases in customer budget and spending in calendar 2022, while we also remain vigilant about the evolution of the COVID pandemic and geopolitical events. Together with our year-to-date performance, we're adjusting our annual spend guidance for the fiscal year to 7% to 8% up from 5% to 7% previously. 15:48 In addition, in support of our growth guidance we\u2019re adjusting our fiscal year guidance for attrition to 5% to 5.5%, compared to approximately 6% previously. While we're pleased with our performance in the first half of the year, and the market trends we're seeing, we\u2019ll remind you of the potential uncertainties that still exist in the market that could change the outlook for our business. 16:18 Our other primary focus in the second half of the fiscal year is completing our transaction with Emerson. Detailed information concerning the transaction can be found in the registration statement on Form S4, recently filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relation page of our website. Based on current information, we continue to expect we will close a transaction during our fourth fiscal quarter. 16:49 As I previewed earlier, we have been incredibly impressed with the OSI and Geological Simulation Software businesses and their employees. Like Aspen Tech, the teams at these two businesses are passionate about their customers and creating value for them. They're also passionate about the industries they serve. It is clear that both businesses have very talented workforce, lead with product innovation in modeling simulation and optimization, and have developed impressive product portfolios that are truly best-in-class. 17:28 The more we learn, the more excited we are for the long-term opportunities we will have as the new Aspen Tech and our unique position to drive profitability and sustainability for customers. We continue to be confident in the new Aspen Tech\u2019s ability to be a consistent mid-teens grower with high recurring revenue, best-in-class margins and substantial free cash flow. 17:56 Underpinning our confidence in the growth opportunity for new Aspen Tech is the increasing importance of sustainability among operators in capital intensive industries. While sustainability has long been part of the value proposition of Aspen Tech in recent years, we have seen it become a critical lens through which many customers make purchasing decisions. 18:21 With this goal in mind, we focused our November software release on introducing over [50] [ph] new sustainability models that accelerate digitalization efforts for customers in support of their initiatives. 18:36 Our customers are taking a truly comprehensive view of how their businesses need to adapt both in the near and the long-term to meet the sustainability targets they have set for themselves. The combined product portfolio of the new Aspen Tech, which will include new electrification and carbon capture capabilities, as well as increasingly leverage AI to enhance the sustainability benefits of many existing Aspen Tech Solutions will make us a key strategic partner for all asset incentive businesses. We\u2019re confident sustainability will support significant investment cycles in this industries over the coming decades. 19:21 Before I turn the call over to Chantelle, I would like to reiterate the key takeaways from the second quarter. Demand trends and growth continued to improve throughout the first half of fiscal 2022, which coupled with greater confidence at Calendar 2022 budgets will lead to increased spending, support our decision to raise the guidance for the full-year. 19:46 While spending is not all the way back to pre-COVID levels, we're increasingly confident that it will continue to trend positively and support our long-term growth targets. The improvement amongst owner operators, particularly refiners is an important trend that is now firmly in place. These customers have been the primary growth drivers for the business for a number of years. And we feel good that they will once again deliver consistent double-digit growth for our MSC suite. 20:20 Our strong year-to-date free cash flow performance demonstrates the scalability and efficiency of our business and our ability to generate high margins while investing in our growth initiatives. 20:35 Finally, we're on track to close with Emerson and create the new Aspen Tech in the coming months. Taken together, we have made great progress on each of our key priorities for fiscal 2022. 20:48 We believe that the combination of the transaction with Emerson and the factors discussed on this call will provide increased confidence in our ability to generate mid-teens growth and exceed $1.5 billion in annual spend in fiscal year 2026. We believe that the steps we have taken this year to create compelling opportunities to generate significant value for our customers and shareholders over the long-term. 21:18 Now, let me turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle?\nChantelle Breithaupt: 21:24 Thank you, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the second quarter fiscal 2022. As a reminder, these results are being reported under topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of revenue recognition for our term license contracts. 21:39 Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings, and more specifically renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. 21:56 The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years, and this non-linearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods. 22:13 In our view, annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business; and annual free cash flow, the most important metric for assessing the overall value our business generates. 22:23 Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for our term license agreements at the end of each period with $640 million at the end of the second quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 6% on a year-over-year basis and 1.7% sequentially. 22:41 Total bookings, which are defined as total value of customer license \u2013 term license contracts where the associated term licenses were deemed delivered in the quarter under topic 606 was $182 million, a 34% decrease year-over-year. The year-over-year decline reflects a particularly strong bookings quarter in the year ago period, which included our largest ever renewal. Total revenue was 171.4 million for the second quarter. 23:08 Turning to profitability, beginning on a GAAP basis, operating expenses for the quarter were $88 million, compared to $70 million in the year ago period. The year-over-year increase in GAAP operating expenses was primarily driven by acquisition and integration planning related expenses associated with our pending transaction with Emerson. 23:29 Total expenses including cost of revenue were $102.9 million, which was up from $84.3 million of the year ago period. Operating income was $68.5 million and net income for the quarter was $61.9 million or $0.92 per share. 23:47 Turning to non-GAAP results, excluding the impact of stock based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and integration planning related fees, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter of $92.2 million, representing a 53.8% non-GAAP operating margin, compared to a non-GAAP operating income margin of $162.2 million, and 69.4% respectively in the year ago period. 24:17 As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period-to-period, due to the timing of customer renewals and therefore licensed revenue recognized during the quarter. In particular, the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was an exceptionally strong license quarter due to the timing of some very large renewals. Non-GAAP net income was $80.6 million or $1.20 per share based on 67.2 million shares outstanding. 24:44 Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with approximately $211 million of cash and cash equivalents and $285 million outstanding under our credit facility. In the second quarter, we generated $41.3 million of cash from operations and $51.9 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software, acquisition, and integration planning related payments. 25:12 From a capital allocation perspective, we repurchased approximately 439,000 shares for 65 million during the second quarter. The final settlement of shares associated with the ASR executing Q2 will occur in Q3. We do not currently anticipate repurchasing additional shares in fiscal 2022. 25:33 I would now like to close with guidance. Our updated outlook reflects the strong performance in the first half of the year, and the improving demand trends we see in many areas of our business. We believe the importance of asset optimization and sustainability are durable growth driver that give us confidence to raise our guidance for the year. 25:52 With respect to annual spend, as Antonio mentioned, we are increasing our outlook for the year to 7% to 8% growth. We\u2019re increasing our bookings guidance range from $814 million to $840 million, which includes $486 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2022. This includes approximately $136 million contracts, up for renewal in the third quarter. 26:18 Our expected revenue range is now $737 million to $754 million. We now expect license revenue in the range of $513 million to $530 million, and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $196 million and $28 million, respectively. 26:37 From an expense perspective, we now expect total GAAP expenses of $413 million to $418 million. This outlook continues to incorporate our ongoing investments in our go to market organization, product development, and business units, including APM, AIoT, and pharmaceuticals. 26:56 We expect GAAP operating income in the range of $324 million to $336 million for fiscal 2022 with GAAP net income of approximately $295 million to $306 million. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $4.37 to $4.53. 27:16 From a non-GAAP perspective, we now expect non-GAAP operating income of $397 million to $409 million and now expect non-GAAP income per share in the range of $5.23 to $5.39. 27:29 From a free cash flow perspective, we are now targeting free cash flow of $280 million to $290 million. Our updated fiscal 2022 free cash flow guidance still assumes cash tax payments in the range of $60 million to $66 million. Our free cash flow outlook is equivalent to between 42% and 43% of annual spend, and highlights our predictable and sustained cash generation. 27:54 To wrap up, Aspen Tech delivered strong second quarter results. We are pleased with the improvements we've seen across the business and the strong execution from our team. Our updated outlook for the year reflects our increased confidence that we are now firmly on the path of faster growth towards our long-term targets. 28:11 We are looking forward to the completion of our transaction with Emerson and the significant opportunities that new Aspen Tech will have to create value for our shareholders. 28:20 And with that operator, we would now like to begin the Q&A.\nOperator: 28:24 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew Obin: 28:43 Yes, guys. Good afternoon.\nAntonio Pietri: 28:46 Yeah, hi. Good afternoon, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: 28:48 Yes. Congratulations. Seems like we're at the bottom or past the bottom. So, the question is, annual spend guidance raised by 1.5 points in the midpoint to 7.5 points from 6. So can you just unpack a little bit how much is upside versus your plan in the first half of FY 2022? How much is it around better market conditions, and how much is more, sort of execution specific like lower E&C attrition and APM wins? Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: 29:19 Okay. Well, Andrew, it's a combination of a number of factors. I'd like to think that our execution in the last few quarters has improved significantly and that's a contributor. Two, no doubt that our customers are now spending more money. 29:50 Clearly, the sales cycles are back to pre-pandemic levels. Deals are now being escalated to the C-suite for final approval and that gives us also the better predictability. And then there's a, sort of improvement in the macro, which is driving gross growth and supported by the spending, but also, I think as the macro has improved attrition, we're getting better insights into how we can reduce attrition. 30:29 And the raise in the guidance is a combination of expectation that will drive some increase in new growth, gross growth, but also that reduction of 0.5 to 1 point of attrition and that supports, sort of from the mid-point, the 1.5 point of increase in the guidance.\nAndrew Obin: 30:56 Alright. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: 30:59 Thank you.\nOperator: 31:00 Our next question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird. Your line is open.\nRob Oliver: 31:06 Great. Thank you very much. Good evening, guys. Appreciate you taking my questions. I had two, one, Antonio, just to start, so nice commentary about the core refining customers really coming back strong. You know, you\u2019ve said it even particular that nice Aspen Mtell [win] [ph] and I think you mentioned that the sales cycles are shortening. I'm just curious, it seems like there might be a bit of pent up demand there for some of those APM related projects and general projects. So, just wanted to kind of maybe get a sense for how much do you think, how much of this issue think is pent-up demand from stuff that was shelved during the pandemic and how much of it represents, sort of ongoing opportunity? And then I had a quick follow-up.\nAntonio Pietri: 31:59 Yes. Yeah. Well, look specifically around APM, the fact is, the majority of the growth that we deliver in the first half of the year for APM came in Q2. Q1 was a challenging quarter for APM. So, the real pickup in the demand for APM in the first half of the year was in the Q2 quarter. 32:29 And I do think like we saw in Q1 with our engineering and MSC suite and then also in Q2, they are somewhat of that pent-up demand. I mean, our Q3 and Q4 quarters, fiscal 2021 were quite constrained from an Aspen standpoint by customers. Customers have remained very interested in our technologies. 32:50 The demand has been there, the engagement, the conversations, and then in Q1 we saw that sort of release as a macro improved, especially oil prices in engineer on MSC. We saw some of that now with APM and look, all the key indicators that we track are open to the ride, they are green. 33:18 We believe that through commentary from our customers through analysis of an analyst in the market, budgets will be better. Our own research through the survey that we conducted last year, which in a way gives us the confidence to raise the guidance and believe in that, you know both APM and our engineering and MSC Suites will have stronger demand. We're a month into our Q3 quarter. We have good visibility in the quarter and Q4 normally is our strongest quarter of the fiscal year. So, we've raised our guidance with a lot of insight and visibility into our pipeline.\nRob Oliver: 34:03 That\u2019s great.\nChantelle Breithaupt: 34:03 Yes. The other thing I was going to add \u2013 sorry Rob, the thing I was going to add to that point is, yes, the one hypothesis, which I assume is in your question, but as a team we are considering to make sure the great growth in the first half wasn't [pull-in] [ph], like it's not a \u2013 we just got the quarter, kind of profile or portfolio run. But given to Antonio\u2019s point, we don't see it as a pull-in, we see it as actually the pent-up demand and quality in hygiene in our second half pipeline. So, that was one of the signs you\u2019re looking for to your question.\nRob Oliver: 34:34 That's great. No, thanks Chantelle. Thanks Antonio. And then, I just had one follow-up and it could be for either of you guys, just on, Antonio, you called out in the deals that you guys are always generous with the color around the deals in the quarter. And a bunch of that you referenced were ELAs and I think you guys had done a little bit of that with your APM business in the past, but I can't say, I recall you stressing ELA so much, having felt you guys for so many years, just was curious, if you could talk a little bit about what the ELA structure means and how if at all it differs and in our durations in these contracts similar to what we're used to with Aspen any color there would be helpful? Thanks again guys.\nAntonio Pietri: 35:15 Yeah, thank you. So, let me start. So certainly, with APM, we've seen multi-site agreements and even a couple of enterprise agreements that cover a lot of sites. Especially in MSC, when it comes to technologies like APC and optimization, we're now seeing and this is a third of those agreements in about a year, a year's time actually going back to Q4 of last year, were customers with very clear intentions to capture emissions are focusing on a total rollout of our APC advanced control technologies to capture the emissions and the value. 36:18 Normally, we would see one of those not very often, but now within a year, we\u2019ve seen three and it will \u2013 in my sense is that it will be a more common occurrence as our customers focus on accelerating the capture of the mission commitments, reduction in emission commitments that they've made, and therefore are willing to negotiate these agreements. 36:50 Look the agreements are still based on the tuck-in licensing model. We just give them enough tokens to do a complete rollout of the technology, but it's all part of the MSC suite and the token licensing system.\nRob Oliver: 37:10 Thanks again.\nAntonio Pietri: 37:12 Hope that answers your question, Rob?\nRob Oliver: 37:14 It did. Thanks again, Antonio.\nAntonio Pietri: 37:16 Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: 37:18 Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Pfau with William Blair. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: 37:24 Hi Matt.\nMatt Pfau: 37:26 Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just wanted to ask on the Russia Ukraine situation, does that have any impact on your business at all?\nAntonio Pietri : 37:37 Well, let me look at \u2013 we do, do business in Russia and we've talked about the performance of our Russian business in the past, but it is not that material to our overall business. Having said that, we have a great team in Russia that is working all the time to close business, but should something were to happen, we're confident that our guidance will hold and then we'll have to determine what it means fiscal year 2023 and going forward, but it is not that material to our overall business.\nMatt Pfau: 38:29 Got it. And then just wanted to ask about your acquisition strategy and if you look at the document that was filed related to the transaction and the timeline, how that went down last year? There were a few acquisition possibilities mentioned in there, not by name, but obviously that you were looking to acquire some businesses and it seemed like they could potentially be larger ones than maybe you\u2019ve done historically. So, any sort of update you can provide in terms of how you're thinking about your acquisition strategy would be helpful?\nAntonio Pietri: 39:06 Yes. Let me look at \u2013 when we announced a transaction back on October 11, we did say that part of the reasons for the transaction that we announcing with Emerson was to create a platform for us to become more acquisitive in the future. That's what we will say for now, we're working on closing the transaction. Once we close it, well then we\u2019ll lift our head and see what's ahead, but the goal it's always been and we said so in October, that we want to be more acquisitive going forward once the transaction closes.\nChantelle Breithaupt: 39:47 Yeah. And the other thing too that has not changed, but just to reinforce for the question is our framework of potential acquisitions of any size, support our double-digit growth strategy, brand spend and our annual spend operating margin framework of 47% to 50%. So, all of those things will be incorporated into any futures considerations.\nMatt Pfau: 40:11 Got it. Thanks a lot guys. Appreciate it.\nAntonio Pietri: 40:14 Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: 40:16 Thank you. Our next question comes from Gal Munda with Berenberg. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: 40:23 Hi, Gal.\nGal Munda: 40:26 Hey, thank you for taking\u2026 Hi, Antonio, hi Chantelle. So, the first question I had was just, expanding a little bit on the ELAs that you mentioned, so you said that the third one in about a year that you talked about, which is interesting, is there a way to think about your, especially MSC customers and thinking about those priorities that they have and how many of those ELA deals could come? And I don't know if you can give us just some, sort of idea of what\u2019s the uplift that those ELA\u2019s come compared to the previous contracts that they had signs in terms of the ACV or annual spend or the way we look at it?\nAntonio Pietri: 41:05 Yes. Well, let me look at it, Gal. My sense is that, but we all know that sustainability is an imperative, but achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 is a tall order. And therefore, my sense is that customers see themselves in a lot of urgency to start reducing their emissions. The low hanging fruit is through efficiencies through energy optimization reductions in energy consumption in their operations and so on. And this is what we do. We've been doing this for 40 years. And now it is \u2013 the spotlight is on it. 41:55 The focus was still on profitability. It has become equal or stronger on sustainability, which is what also excites us very much because you can deliver both profitability and sustainability using our technology. So, what we are seeing is, is this customer that already have a significant penetration in the use of our technology, multi-variable control and optimization in their assets. And normally in the past, they've been increasing the use or the deployment one unit at a time, one drink at a time. 42:38 And this imperative around sustainability is now driving them to say, no, we need to blanket all of our process unit and refineries or chemical plans, as quickly as possible with this technology so that we can account for those reduction and emissions. So, they are coming to the table and saying, look, we know we already have this entitlement, why would it take to do an enterprise agreement? 43:05 And then that's a negotiation and depending on how much penetration that customer has of the technology, well they are believed can be from a six figure number to seven figure number. So, my sense is that, we will see some of those with greater occurrence or frequency in the future.\nGal Munda: 43:33 That's really helpful. Thank you. And then the other comment you made, which was interesting was how the customers have responded to your pending transaction with Emerson software side. When you said there's a positive feedback coming, does that imply some sort of revenue synergies that you think you can then extract because of the \u2013 because of the tie-up, is it either in go-to-markets or just join products together. Maybe if you can just note the excitement from the customers, what were they saying that they like in the tie-up itself? Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: 44:12 Yes. I think from a customer standpoint is not necessarily about revenue synergies. From our standpoint is certainly about revenue synergies. Look, I think customers are seeing two great engineering technology companies coming together that are \u2013 they both \u2013 both companies are key strategic suppliers to them. 44:39 They rely on both companies for different technologies in different areas, but they also see the opportunity to bring together our solutions and create packaged solutions around sustainability emissions tracking. For example, greater productivity improvements and so on. 45:00 So, what they see \u2013 what they\u2019d say is, a lot of logic around the transaction, the culture of the companies, the focus on innovation and technology, the common customer base and so on. And then, okay, they believe that there\u2019s significant technical synergies between the two companies and they're looking forward to seeing those. 45:26 Of course, from our side is, it's something that I felt and we felt was part of the thesis for doing this with Emerson, and it's part of the revenue synergies that we talked about when we announced the transaction.\nChantelle Breithaupt: 45:39 Yeah. And I think just in addition, the one thing I would add, Antonio is, the other thing that I've heard that I got very excited about is just the joint go to market capabilities between the sales teams, the partner channels, etcetera. So, I think that's also a very powerful thing that they're looking at. Just one more thing to add.\nGal Munda: 45:58 Thank you so much for answering the questions. I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: 46:04 Thank you, Gal.\nOperator: 46:07 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Jackson Ader with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: 46:20 Hi, Jack.\nJackson Ader: 46:22 Hi. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Antonio, you mentioned the budgets improving and the filing for [2022] [ph], I think, you know the outlook for 2022, I'm just curious how they compare to like the budget levels of say 2019? Are we back to those levels yet?\nAntonio Pietri: 46:46 No, let me \u2013 and Jackson, time will tell. I don't necessarily think that we\u2019re there yet. Look, if you read the analysis of the refining market in the calendar fourth quarter, meaning the December quarter, refining margins even exceeded some of the most recent margins and were somewhere back to 2010 levels. Sort of the golden years of refining margins, that sort of December. But we said in the October call that refining margins were back into the historical range, but at the low end of the range. 47:33 My sense is that refiners certainly see, and we\u2019ve also heard CEOs from some of the refining companies talk about much better outlook for 2022. So, my sense is that their budgets for 2022 will be much better. When they were setting them, they were still somewhere towards the low end of the range, but nonetheless there'll be much better and we\u2019re in 2021 and 2020. 48:10 So, are they going to be back to 2019? Time will tell. But I do see based on what we saw in Q4 in our, sorry, our Q2 quarter, the December quarter that these customers are now ready to spend and that's what our guidance reflects.\nJackson Ader: 48:36 Okay. Alright, great. And then a follow-up on the APM suite. It seems like the business broadly is seeing a lot of tailwinds. And I'm just curious, is there anything about the specific to APM that is easily explainable as to why that was kind of the only portion of the business that came in below what you're expecting in the first half?\nAntonio Pietri: 49:02 Yes. I mean, just below our plan. The fact is that our plan was conservative, very conservative for APM in the first half of the year. We always felt that we needed new budgets in this calendar year for APM to really start seeing a lift-up. We saw that \u2013 we started to see that in Q2. Q1, I would call the trough for APM being Q1. 49:31 So, look, I think it's all about priorities in our customers organizations. If you read about the industry in that October, November period, it was a lot of material region about these companies starting to focus back on maintenance and reliability, which I think is what we saw in the quarter and I'm sure it will be reflected in the budgets for this calendar year. So, we're optimistic about it, but also cautious. So\u2026\nJackson Ader: 50:10 Okay. Alright, great. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: 50:12 Thank you, Jackson.\nOperator: 50:14 Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Schappel with Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nMark Schappel: 50:21 Hi, thank you for taking my question. Antonio, pharma and metals and mining were two areas of your business that we're receiving increased investment this year. I was wondering if you could just give us an update on the progress you're making on those fronts? And also, how did those businesses fair this quarter?\nAntonio Pietri : 50:38 Yes. Well look we're going to give guidance on pharma or metals and mining because the fact to the matter is that business flows through our engineering MSC and APM suite, so a lot of what you hear about our engineer MSC and APM suite is also reflection of the contribution from those two industries. But what I'll give you, sort of at a high level around pharma is look, we now have a sales team that has been engaged with our customers in those industries is starting to gain traction and build pipeline, and we expect the contribution from the business to really start showing up here in the second half. 51:26 And the metals and mining has been an ongoing activity to our focus with APM on that sector. We saw business out of customers in the Q2 quarter and a little bit in the Q1 quarter as well. And really the step-up in investments in metals and mining will come in the second half of this year. And then certainly for fiscal year 2023. But look, part of the excitement around the Emerson transaction is also Emerson\u2019s market position in Pharmaceuticals. In the space that they're in, in pharmaceutical software, they have an important market share. So, certainly, the Emerson will be an important channel to market for us in pharmaceuticals. 52:25 And then they have some capabilities in metals and mining, nothing like they have in pharma and we'll also try to leverage those, but pharmaceuticals, we hope to benefit from their presence in that industry.\nMark Schappel: 52:41 Great. That's helpful. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: 52:43 Yeah. Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: 52:45 Thank you. And this ends our Q&A session. I will turn the call back to Antonio Pietri for his final remarks.\nAntonio Pietri: 52:54 Thank you, [Carmen] [ph], and thank you everyone for joining us today for this call. Look forward to participating in the different investor conferences and calls with you and investors over the coming months. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: 53:11 Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "21:24 Thank you, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the second quarter fiscal 2022. As a reminder, these results are being reported under topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of revenue recognition for our term license contracts. 21:39 Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings, and more specifically renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. 21:56 The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years, and this non-linearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods. 22:13 In our view, annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business; and annual free cash flow, the most important metric for assessing the overall value our business generates. 22:23 Annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for our term license agreements at the end of each period with $640 million at the end of the second quarter. This represented an increase of approximately 6% on a year-over-year basis and 1.7% sequentially. 22:41 Total bookings, which are defined as total value of customer license \u2013 term license contracts where the associated term licenses were deemed delivered in the quarter under topic 606 was $182 million, a 34% decrease year-over-year. The year-over-year decline reflects a particularly strong bookings quarter in the year ago period, which included our largest ever renewal. Total revenue was 171.4 million for the second quarter. 23:08 Turning to profitability, beginning on a GAAP basis, operating expenses for the quarter were $88 million, compared to $70 million in the year ago period. The year-over-year increase in GAAP operating expenses was primarily driven by acquisition and integration planning related expenses associated with our pending transaction with Emerson. 23:29 Total expenses including cost of revenue were $102.9 million, which was up from $84.3 million of the year ago period. Operating income was $68.5 million and net income for the quarter was $61.9 million or $0.92 per share. 23:47 Turning to non-GAAP results, excluding the impact of stock based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and integration planning related fees, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter of $92.2 million, representing a 53.8% non-GAAP operating margin, compared to a non-GAAP operating income margin of $162.2 million, and 69.4% respectively in the year ago period. 24:17 As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period-to-period, due to the timing of customer renewals and therefore licensed revenue recognized during the quarter. In particular, the second quarter of fiscal 2021 was an exceptionally strong license quarter due to the timing of some very large renewals. Non-GAAP net income was $80.6 million or $1.20 per share based on 67.2 million shares outstanding. 24:44 Turning now to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with approximately $211 million of cash and cash equivalents and $285 million outstanding under our credit facility. In the second quarter, we generated $41.3 million of cash from operations and $51.9 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software, acquisition, and integration planning related payments. 25:12 From a capital allocation perspective, we repurchased approximately 439,000 shares for 65 million during the second quarter. The final settlement of shares associated with the ASR executing Q2 will occur in Q3. We do not currently anticipate repurchasing additional shares in fiscal 2022. 25:33 I would now like to close with guidance. Our updated outlook reflects the strong performance in the first half of the year, and the improving demand trends we see in many areas of our business. We believe the importance of asset optimization and sustainability are durable growth driver that give us confidence to raise our guidance for the year. 25:52 With respect to annual spend, as Antonio mentioned, we are increasing our outlook for the year to 7% to 8% growth. We're increasing our bookings guidance range from $814 million to $840 million, which includes $486 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2022. This includes approximately $136 million contracts, up for renewal in the third quarter. 26:18 Our expected revenue range is now $737 million to $754 million. We now expect license revenue in the range of $513 million to $530 million, and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $196 million and $28 million, respectively. 26:37 From an expense perspective, we now expect total GAAP expenses of $413 million to $418 million. This outlook continues to incorporate our ongoing investments in our go to market organization, product development, and business units, including APM, AIoT, and pharmaceuticals. 26:56 We expect GAAP operating income in the range of $324 million to $336 million for fiscal 2022 with GAAP net income of approximately $295 million to $306 million. We expect GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $4.37 to $4.53. 27:16 From a non-GAAP perspective, we now expect non-GAAP operating income of $397 million to $409 million and now expect non-GAAP income per share in the range of $5.23 to $5.39. 27:29 From a free cash flow perspective, we are now targeting free cash flow of $280 million to $290 million. Our updated fiscal 2022 free cash flow guidance still assumes cash tax payments in the range of $60 million to $66 million. Our free cash flow outlook is equivalent to between 42% and 43% of annual spend, and highlights our predictable and sustained cash generation. 27:54 To wrap up, Aspen Tech delivered strong second quarter results. We are pleased with the improvements we've seen across the business and the strong execution from our team. Our updated outlook for the year reflects our increased confidence that we are now firmly on the path of faster growth towards our long-term targets. 28:11 We are looking forward to the completion of our transaction with Emerson and the significant opportunities that new Aspen Tech will have to create value for our shareholders. 28:20 And with that operator, we would now like to begin the Q&A. 34:03 Yes. The other thing I was going to add \u2013 sorry Rob, the thing I was going to add to that point is, yes, the one hypothesis, which I assume is in your question, but as a team we are considering to make sure the great growth in the first half wasn't [pull-in] [ph], like it's not a \u2013 we just got the quarter, kind of profile or portfolio run. But given to Antonio's point, we don't see it as a pull-in, we see it as actually the pent-up demand and quality in hygiene in our second half pipeline. So, that was one of the signs you're looking for to your question. 39:47 Yeah. And the other thing too that has not changed, but just to reinforce for the question is our framework of potential acquisitions of any size, support our double-digit growth strategy, brand spend and our annual spend operating margin framework of 47% to 50%. So, all of those things will be incorporated into any futures considerations. 45:39 Yeah. And I think just in addition, the one thing I would add, Antonio is, the other thing that I've heard that I got very excited about is just the joint go to market capabilities between the sales teams, the partner channels, etcetera. So, I think that's also a very powerful thing that they're looking at. Just one more thing to add."

            "name": "Antonio Pietri",
            "content": "01:56 Thanks, Brian. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We delivered strong second quarter results that reflect continued improvement in the spending environment and good execution by our team. Our second quarter performance reinforces our belief in the strategic importance to customers of enhancing the operational efficiency and sustainability of their assets. 02:24 We're now seeing this customer trend materialize in better growth as market conditions have normalized. While not all the way to back to pre-COVID levels, market conditions are moving concretely in the right direction for Aspen Tech. We're confident this will continue to support improved annual spend growth across our business over time. 02:49 We've also made significant progress towards completing the proposed transaction with Emerson, which remains on track to close during our fourth fiscal quarter. As we've gotten to know the Emerson businesses better, we're continually impressed by the team and their culture. 03:09 Since the announcement, we've also received more and more positive feedback from customers in a number of industries about their enthusiasm for the transaction. Given all of this, we're even more excited about the transformational opportunity the new Aspen Tech has in current and new verticals, as well as in sustainability, allowing for increased value creation opportunities for both our customers and shareholders. 03:38 Looking quickly at our financial results in the second quarter, revenue was $171.4 million, GAAP EPS was $0.92, and non-GAAP EPS was $1.20. Annual spend was $640 million, up 1.7% in the quarter and 6% year-over-year. And free cash flow was $51.9 million. 04:09 Looking at the second quarter in more detail, one of the key areas of improvement was the normalization of transaction closing cycles, which are now back to pre-pandemic cycle times. I'm pleased at how our sales organization has navigated these changes in recent quarters. 04:27 In terms of vertical performance, expanding by our refining customers saw notable improvement for the second consecutive quarter. As we have discussed in the past, refining has been a consistent source of a strength for Aspen Tech as our solutions are critical to delivering on the short-term and long-term operational and sustainability priorities of our customers. 04:52 During the second half of calendar 2021, refining margins improved meaningfully and trended back to their historical range ending up on a strong note in December. We're also encouraged by the fact that the Omicron variant has not reduced fuel demand for transportation, despite causing record numbers of COVID cases, with low inventories for diesel and jet fuel now being reported. 05:21 The performance of our refining customers in the first half of the fiscal year gives us confidence that this vertical will support the MSC business returning to consistent double-digit annual spend growth, assuming a stronger budget and spending in calendar 2022. 05:40 Chemicals, once again had a solid quarter and has been the most consistent vertical over the past two years. Within chemicals, there continue to be some areas that face supply chain constraints, but overall, we've had consistently good conversations with customers under future investment priorities. 06:00 We believe there are exciting opportunities for growth in this market and that Aspen Tech will continue to be an important partner to our customers as they drive operational excellence and transition to a more sustainable future, which for them means lower emissions, as well as circularity. 06:21 The positive results from our refining and chemicals customers drove better than expected performance for our engineering and MSC suites, which are ahead of plan for the first half of the fiscal year. 06:34 The EMC industry performed better than expected delivering a slightly positive growth quarter. The market dynamics affecting this industry have largely stabilized and backlog trends have shown modest positive improvements in the first half of the year. 06:50 Importantly, attrition amongst these customers has been tracking marginally better than expectations and we're optimistic about our ability to forecast this metric. This is a critical first step towards improved demand and a return to a stronger positive annual spend growth. 07:08 While we do not expect the E&C sector to be a primary growth driver for our business short-term, we're encouraged by deceleration in final investment decisions, FIDs, for LNG projects and in the oil and gas sector in the Middle East region, as well as expected increase in global oil and gas CapEx in calendar 2022. 07:32 In addition, the shift in their focus towards sustainability investments will help accelerate their recovery as increasingly CapEx spend will be driven by hydrogen projects carbon capture and sequestration, biofuels, wind, solar, and other projects. We believe this will drive E&C customers to be greater contributors to our long term growth target than they are today. 07:58 Finally, I would like to provide an update on our APM suite. We're beginning to see some improvement in demand conversion in this area of the business as customers increase OpEx spend on maintenance and reliability in facilities where a lot of this work was postponed throughout the pandemic. 08:17 As we have discussed during the same period of the pandemic, interest and demand for our APM solutions have been strong with consistent growth in customer engagement pipeline and pilots. Through the first half of the year, APM contributed 0.28 points of annual spend growth, just under our first half year plan. 08:41 We believe the suite is well-positioned to benefit from increased spending and contribute approximately 1 point of annual spend growth in fiscal 2022. We're also confident that our pandemic tested APM business will be better positioned for growth longer-term. 09:00 Following are references to a few of the customer transactions closed in the quarter: First, our U.S. Headquarter engineering firm, a customer for close to 15 years increased its spend with Aspen Tech now that its business outlook is improving after having reviews, its software license entitlement at renewal at the beginning of the pandemic. After conducting a thorough analysis of the market, including competitive offerings, the customer increased its commitment to the suite. 09:32 The availability in the suite of Aspen Tech's ACCE product for Capital Cost Estimation was fundamental in the decision because the customer is in the process of reconstituting its capital cost estimation team that has been dismantled at the beginning of the pandemic and its functionality is not available in the market from other competitors. 09:55 Second, a European energy and petrochemical company and long-term user of our multivariable control technology in refining and chemicals decided to standardize all operating assets on our Aspen DMC3 multivariable control technology through an enterprise license agreement. 10:16 Two main reasons supported their decision: The operational improvement on value created by the technology; and the customers' focus on energy efficiency and emissions reduction as part of our commitment to net zero carbon emissions by 2050. 10:34 Third, a refining customer [in Asia] [ph] conducted an extensive evaluation of asset predictive maintenance solutions, including Aspen Anto. The customer selected Aspen Anto on the basis of its technical capabilities and ease of implementation. 10:54 The acquisition of an APM solution support the planned digitalization of the customer's maintenance functional area. It is expected that Aspen Anto will be rolled out to multiple units and equipment in the refinery and in-time expanded to other refineries. 11:34 Operator, are you able to listen to us? Okay. Operator, are we back? 11:43 Okay. Thank you. We lost our network connection here in the office. So, let me get back to the \u2013 is audience able to hear me? 11:56 Okay, great. Let me get back to our customer references. Third, a refining customer [in Asia] [ph] conducted an extensive evaluation of asset predictive maintenance solutions, including Aspen Anto. The customer selected Aspen Anto on the basis of its technical capabilities and ease of implementation. The acquisition of an APM solution supports the planned digitalization of the customer's maintenance functional area. 12:25 It is expected that Aspen Anto will be rolled out to multiple units and equipment in the refinery and in time expanded to other refiners. Fourth and final, a Northern Europe independent refiner, recently formed from the acquisition of assets divested by one of the major oil companies sought to upgrade the optimization technologies in the refinery to increase profitability and reduce emissions as part of the customers and host countries commitment to net zero carbon emissions. 13:00 After a detailed analysis of the value capture opportunity, which was determined to be greater than $75 million per year and the estimation of the expected reduction in emissions, the customer committed to a site license for the Aspen DMC3 multivariable control technology and the Aspen GDOT multi-unit optimization technology in the MSC suite. This agreement was signed in a three month sales cycle. 13:31 I point out that in two of the highlighted transactions, the customers requested enterprise license agreements to deploy certain solutions across the entire asset base. We're encouraged by these examples of customers preparing comprehensive agreements to deploy solutions that are critical to their sustainability initiatives. It's important to note that these agreements are still a structure as part of our token based licensing model. 14:02 As we look to the second half of the fiscal year and calendar 2022, we're encouraged by the recent trends in key macro indicators for our business. Oil demand, while not yet at pre-pandemic levels has exceeded growth expectations. Oil prices in the range of $75 to $85 per barrel and an equally strong or stronger outlook for calendar 2022. 14:33 Refining margins back in the historical range with the industry expectations for acceleration in fuels consumption and is strengthening margins in 2022. Chemical demand and margins expected to remain strong in calendar 2022. 14:51 CapEx spending in oil and gas and chemicals is expected to increase by double-digits with CapEx spend in hydrogen carbon capture and sequestration and biofuels projects experiencing significant increases as sustainability investments accelerate. And software spend in our customer base projected to increase 10% to 15% based on customer surveys we conducted late last year. 15:20 All of these leads to our expectation of solid increases in customer budget and spending in calendar 2022, while we also remain vigilant about the evolution of the COVID pandemic and geopolitical events. Together with our year-to-date performance, we're adjusting our annual spend guidance for the fiscal year to 7% to 8% up from 5% to 7% previously. 15:48 In addition, in support of our growth guidance we're adjusting our fiscal year guidance for attrition to 5% to 5.5%, compared to approximately 6% previously. While we're pleased with our performance in the first half of the year, and the market trends we're seeing, we'll remind you of the potential uncertainties that still exist in the market that could change the outlook for our business. 16:18 Our other primary focus in the second half of the fiscal year is completing our transaction with Emerson. Detailed information concerning the transaction can be found in the registration statement on Form S4, recently filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relation page of our website. Based on current information, we continue to expect we will close a transaction during our fourth fiscal quarter. 16:49 As I previewed earlier, we have been incredibly impressed with the OSI and Geological Simulation Software businesses and their employees. Like Aspen Tech, the teams at these two businesses are passionate about their customers and creating value for them. They're also passionate about the industries they serve. It is clear that both businesses have very talented workforce, lead with product innovation in modeling simulation and optimization, and have developed impressive product portfolios that are truly best-in-class. 17:28 The more we learn, the more excited we are for the long-term opportunities we will have as the new Aspen Tech and our unique position to drive profitability and sustainability for customers. We continue to be confident in the new Aspen Tech's ability to be a consistent mid-teens grower with high recurring revenue, best-in-class margins and substantial free cash flow. 17:56 Underpinning our confidence in the growth opportunity for new Aspen Tech is the increasing importance of sustainability among operators in capital intensive industries. While sustainability has long been part of the value proposition of Aspen Tech in recent years, we have seen it become a critical lens through which many customers make purchasing decisions. 18:21 With this goal in mind, we focused our November software release on introducing over [50] [ph] new sustainability models that accelerate digitalization efforts for customers in support of their initiatives. 18:36 Our customers are taking a truly comprehensive view of how their businesses need to adapt both in the near and the long-term to meet the sustainability targets they have set for themselves. The combined product portfolio of the new Aspen Tech, which will include new electrification and carbon capture capabilities, as well as increasingly leverage AI to enhance the sustainability benefits of many existing Aspen Tech Solutions will make us a key strategic partner for all asset incentive businesses. We're confident sustainability will support significant investment cycles in this industries over the coming decades. 19:21 Before I turn the call over to Chantelle, I would like to reiterate the key takeaways from the second quarter. Demand trends and growth continued to improve throughout the first half of fiscal 2022, which coupled with greater confidence at Calendar 2022 budgets will lead to increased spending, support our decision to raise the guidance for the full-year. 19:46 While spending is not all the way back to pre-COVID levels, we're increasingly confident that it will continue to trend positively and support our long-term growth targets. The improvement amongst owner operators, particularly refiners is an important trend that is now firmly in place. These customers have been the primary growth drivers for the business for a number of years. And we feel good that they will once again deliver consistent double-digit growth for our MSC suite. 20:20 Our strong year-to-date free cash flow performance demonstrates the scalability and efficiency of our business and our ability to generate high margins while investing in our growth initiatives. 20:35 Finally, we're on track to close with Emerson and create the new Aspen Tech in the coming months. Taken together, we have made great progress on each of our key priorities for fiscal 2022. 20:48 We believe that the combination of the transaction with Emerson and the factors discussed on this call will provide increased confidence in our ability to generate mid-teens growth and exceed $1.5 billion in annual spend in fiscal year 2026. We believe that the steps we have taken this year to create compelling opportunities to generate significant value for our customers and shareholders over the long-term. 21:18 Now, let me turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle? 28:46 Yeah, hi. Good afternoon, Andrew. 29:19 Okay. Well, Andrew, it's a combination of a number of factors. I'd like to think that our execution in the last few quarters has improved significantly and that's a contributor. Two, no doubt that our customers are now spending more money. 29:50 Clearly, the sales cycles are back to pre-pandemic levels. Deals are now being escalated to the C-suite for final approval and that gives us also the better predictability. And then there's a, sort of improvement in the macro, which is driving gross growth and supported by the spending, but also, I think as the macro has improved attrition, we're getting better insights into how we can reduce attrition. 30:29 And the raise in the guidance is a combination of expectation that will drive some increase in new growth, gross growth, but also that reduction of 0.5 to 1 point of attrition and that supports, sort of from the mid-point, the 1.5 point of increase in the guidance. 30:59 Thank you. 31:59 Yes. Yeah. Well, look specifically around APM, the fact is, the majority of the growth that we deliver in the first half of the year for APM came in Q2. Q1 was a challenging quarter for APM. So, the real pickup in the demand for APM in the first half of the year was in the Q2 quarter. 32:29 And I do think like we saw in Q1 with our engineering and MSC suite and then also in Q2, they are somewhat of that pent-up demand. I mean, our Q3 and Q4 quarters, fiscal 2021 were quite constrained from an Aspen standpoint by customers. Customers have remained very interested in our technologies. 32:50 The demand has been there, the engagement, the conversations, and then in Q1 we saw that sort of release as a macro improved, especially oil prices in engineer on MSC. We saw some of that now with APM and look, all the key indicators that we track are open to the ride, they are green. 33:18 We believe that through commentary from our customers through analysis of an analyst in the market, budgets will be better. Our own research through the survey that we conducted last year, which in a way gives us the confidence to raise the guidance and believe in that, you know both APM and our engineering and MSC Suites will have stronger demand. We're a month into our Q3 quarter. We have good visibility in the quarter and Q4 normally is our strongest quarter of the fiscal year. So, we've raised our guidance with a lot of insight and visibility into our pipeline. 35:15 Yeah, thank you. So, let me start. So certainly, with APM, we've seen multi-site agreements and even a couple of enterprise agreements that cover a lot of sites. Especially in MSC, when it comes to technologies like APC and optimization, we're now seeing and this is a third of those agreements in about a year, a year's time actually going back to Q4 of last year, were customers with very clear intentions to capture emissions are focusing on a total rollout of our APC advanced control technologies to capture the emissions and the value. 36:18 Normally, we would see one of those not very often, but now within a year, we've seen three and it will \u2013 in my sense is that it will be a more common occurrence as our customers focus on accelerating the capture of the mission commitments, reduction in emission commitments that they've made, and therefore are willing to negotiate these agreements. 36:50 Look the agreements are still based on the tuck-in licensing model. We just give them enough tokens to do a complete rollout of the technology, but it's all part of the MSC suite and the token licensing system. 37:12 Hope that answers your question, Rob? 37:16 Yeah. Thank you. 37:24 Hi Matt. 37:37 Well, let me look at \u2013 we do, do business in Russia and we've talked about the performance of our Russian business in the past, but it is not that material to our overall business. Having said that, we have a great team in Russia that is working all the time to close business, but should something were to happen, we're confident that our guidance will hold and then we'll have to determine what it means fiscal year 2023 and going forward, but it is not that material to our overall business. 39:06 Yes. Let me look at \u2013 when we announced a transaction back on October 11, we did say that part of the reasons for the transaction that we announcing with Emerson was to create a platform for us to become more acquisitive in the future. That's what we will say for now, we're working on closing the transaction. Once we close it, well then we'll lift our head and see what's ahead, but the goal it's always been and we said so in October, that we want to be more acquisitive going forward once the transaction closes. 40:14 Thank you, Matt. 40:23 Hi, Gal. 41:05 Yes. Well, let me look at it, Gal. My sense is that, but we all know that sustainability is an imperative, but achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 is a tall order. And therefore, my sense is that customers see themselves in a lot of urgency to start reducing their emissions. The low hanging fruit is through efficiencies through energy optimization reductions in energy consumption in their operations and so on. And this is what we do. We've been doing this for 40 years. And now it is \u2013 the spotlight is on it. 41:55 The focus was still on profitability. It has become equal or stronger on sustainability, which is what also excites us very much because you can deliver both profitability and sustainability using our technology. So, what we are seeing is, is this customer that already have a significant penetration in the use of our technology, multi-variable control and optimization in their assets. And normally in the past, they've been increasing the use or the deployment one unit at a time, one drink at a time. 42:38 And this imperative around sustainability is now driving them to say, no, we need to blanket all of our process unit and refineries or chemical plans, as quickly as possible with this technology so that we can account for those reduction and emissions. So, they are coming to the table and saying, look, we know we already have this entitlement, why would it take to do an enterprise agreement? 43:05 And then that's a negotiation and depending on how much penetration that customer has of the technology, well they are believed can be from a six figure number to seven figure number. So, my sense is that, we will see some of those with greater occurrence or frequency in the future. 44:12 Yes. I think from a customer standpoint is not necessarily about revenue synergies. From our standpoint is certainly about revenue synergies. Look, I think customers are seeing two great engineering technology companies coming together that are \u2013 they both \u2013 both companies are key strategic suppliers to them. 44:39 They rely on both companies for different technologies in different areas, but they also see the opportunity to bring together our solutions and create packaged solutions around sustainability emissions tracking. For example, greater productivity improvements and so on. 45:00 So, what they see \u2013 what they'd say is, a lot of logic around the transaction, the culture of the companies, the focus on innovation and technology, the common customer base and so on. And then, okay, they believe that there's significant technical synergies between the two companies and they're looking forward to seeing those. 45:26 Of course, from our side is, it's something that I felt and we felt was part of the thesis for doing this with Emerson, and it's part of the revenue synergies that we talked about when we announced the transaction. 46:04 Thank you, Gal. 46:20 Hi, Jack. 46:46 No, let me \u2013 and Jackson, time will tell. I don't necessarily think that we're there yet. Look, if you read the analysis of the refining market in the calendar fourth quarter, meaning the December quarter, refining margins even exceeded some of the most recent margins and were somewhere back to 2010 levels. Sort of the golden years of refining margins, that sort of December. But we said in the October call that refining margins were back into the historical range, but at the low end of the range. 47:33 My sense is that refiners certainly see, and we've also heard CEOs from some of the refining companies talk about much better outlook for 2022. So, my sense is that their budgets for 2022 will be much better. When they were setting them, they were still somewhere towards the low end of the range, but nonetheless there'll be much better and we're in 2021 and 2020. 48:10 So, are they going to be back to 2019? Time will tell. But I do see based on what we saw in Q4 in our, sorry, our Q2 quarter, the December quarter that these customers are now ready to spend and that's what our guidance reflects. 49:02 Yes. I mean, just below our plan. The fact is that our plan was conservative, very conservative for APM in the first half of the year. We always felt that we needed new budgets in this calendar year for APM to really start seeing a lift-up. We saw that \u2013 we started to see that in Q2. Q1, I would call the trough for APM being Q1. 49:31 So, look, I think it's all about priorities in our customers organizations. If you read about the industry in that October, November period, it was a lot of material region about these companies starting to focus back on maintenance and reliability, which I think is what we saw in the quarter and I'm sure it will be reflected in the budgets for this calendar year. So, we're optimistic about it, but also cautious. So... 50:12 Thank you, Jackson. 50:38 Yes. Well look we're going to give guidance on pharma or metals and mining because the fact to the matter is that business flows through our engineering MSC and APM suite, so a lot of what you hear about our engineer MSC and APM suite is also reflection of the contribution from those two industries. But what I'll give you, sort of at a high level around pharma is look, we now have a sales team that has been engaged with our customers in those industries is starting to gain traction and build pipeline, and we expect the contribution from the business to really start showing up here in the second half. 51:26 And the metals and mining has been an ongoing activity to our focus with APM on that sector. We saw business out of customers in the Q2 quarter and a little bit in the Q1 quarter as well. And really the step-up in investments in metals and mining will come in the second half of this year. And then certainly for fiscal year 2023. But look, part of the excitement around the Emerson transaction is also Emerson's market position in Pharmaceuticals. In the space that they're in, in pharmaceutical software, they have an important market share. So, certainly, the Emerson will be an important channel to market for us in pharmaceuticals. 52:25 And then they have some capabilities in metals and mining, nothing like they have in pharma and we'll also try to leverage those, but pharmaceuticals, we hope to benefit from their presence in that industry. 52:43 Yeah. Thank you, Mark. 52:54 Thank you, [Carmen] [ph], and thank you everyone for joining us today for this call. Look forward to participating in the different investor conferences and calls with you and investors over the coming months. Thanks everyone."

And welcome to the Q4 2021 Aspen Technology Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead\nBrian Denyeau: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 ending September 30, 2021. With me on the call today are Antonio Pietri, Aspen Tech's President and CEO and Chantelle Breithaupt, CFO of Aspen Tech. Before we begin, I will make the Safe Harbor statement that during the course of this call, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from such projections or statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's call and contained in our most recently filed Form 10-Q. Also, please note that the following information relates to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, October 27, 2021. Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. The structure of today's call will be as follows; Antonio will discuss business highlights from the first quarter and their pending agreement with Emerson and then I will review our financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal year 2022. Chantelle will review our financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal year 2022. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks, Brian. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a strong start to the year with annual spend coming in above our expectations. We saw a notable improvement in the spending environment during the quarter as a continuing economic recovery has improved end market conditions for many of our customers. As we have discussed over the past 12 months, we have seen consistently strong demand indications from our customers about expanding adoption of Aspen Tech solutions to increase operational efficiency and sustainability. While the market is not yet back to pre-COVID levels we believe that first quarter was an important indicator that a spending by our customers is improving. More importantly, the recent announcement of our transaction with Emerson is a transformational moment for Aspen Tech. I'll discuss it in more detail later, but we cannot be more excited at the opportunity for the new Aspen Tech to deliver faster and greater value in sustainability, innovation and profitability to a broader set of customers. Looking quickly at our financial results in the first quarter, revenue was $136 million, GAAP EPS was $0.58 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.77. Annual spend was $630 million up 1.4% in the quarter and 5.6% year-over-year and free cash flow was $33 million. Looking at our first quarter performance in more detail, we saw clear signs of normalization in spending across our owner operator markets. In particular while the extra steps and scrutiny around the transaction approval process have remained in place, customer executives are noticeably more comfortable giving the final approval to transactions. We believe customers remain mindful of the fluidity with which market conditions can change, but the improved environment is enabling them to focus on the future, including how to deliver on their long-term and strategic objectives. We're optimistic this will be reflected in the CapEx and OpEx budgets for calendar 2022, that customers are now developing. Looking at the business by vertical, we saw the most notable improvement amongst our owner operator customers, but especially with refining customers spending by this customers grew our MSC business by 3.2% sequentially and 9% in the last 12 months just shy of its historical double-digit growth rate, which is a strong performance, especially when compared to the growth of the MSC business in fiscal year 2021 at 5.8%. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we have seen a marked increase in the level of engagement with this customers in recent months about their future investment priorities. Our results in the quarter are an indication that improved conversations were signalling an improving sentiment from higher refining margins resulting in increased spending. Our chemicals business also performed better and continue to improve sequentially contributing to the acceleration of the MSC business. While overall trends are encouraging, there are still sectors of the chemical supply chains that are recovering from the linker and economic effects of COVID. We're confident chemicals will continue to be an important growth contributor going forward. Aspen Tech Solutions are essential to chemical customers' ability to achieve their operational and supply chain efficiencies and sustainability targets. Our E&C business performed as expected during the quarter. Conditions remained challenging and we have seen only modest improvements in CapEx and backlog trends. We expect this will be the part of the business that takes the longest to return to normal and we anticipate modest levels of growth from this customers for the foreseeable future. Attrition in the quarter was in line with our expectations, which if you recall, from our last earnings call was expected to be higher in the first quarter, given the timing of renewals this fiscal year. While we're optimistic about the improve spending environment and higher budgets in calendar 2022, we believe it is appropriate for now to maintain our guidance for growth in annual spend in the range of 5% to 7%. We're also maintaining our guidance for attrition in the year, which as we previously stated is mainly a reflection of the reduction in CapEx in the E&C space and elevated levels of renewables in our fiscal year 2022. Following are some notable wins from the quarter; first, a global energy company in the Middle East and a long time user of Aspen Tech's engineering and MSC suite signed an agreement to standardize on the use of Aspen Tech's PM [ph] solution for refining. After a rigorous process to evaluate the capabilities and incremental value creation opportunities of PM, the customer committed to standardize on the technology and executed on a global rollout of this technology. The deployment of PM is always expected to generate tens of millions of dollars of benefits for this customer. Second our US based multinational food processing and commodities trading company, user of our engineer and MSC suites has committed to roll out our recently released batch APC capabilities across their bioproducts manufacturing business. Bioproducts manufacturer, amino acids from core through fermentation. After a rigorous trial of the technology, the customer recognized sufficient value from improving production yields in their bioproducts manufacturing to commit to the technology. A new batch APC technology is expected to open up new use cases in batch production processes, as opposed to the continuous processes found in refining on bulk chemicals. We expect our batch PC technology to extend our reach further into specialty chemicals, bioprocesses pharma and other industries that use batch processing. Third and final customer reference, a US energy company and a subsidiary of a global Middle East energy company expanded the use of the engineer and MSC suites to execute on our comprehensive deployment of production planning and production operations optimization solutions to realize benefits in excess of $50 million per year in their manufacturing complex. The products involved are planning, scheduling dynamic optimization technology or GDOT, multi-variable process control and engineering suite. One of the key themes you've heard from Aspen Tech in recent years is our commitment to a sustainable future. To that end, in just a few days, Aspen Tech will join companies from around the world at COP26 to discuss and share solutions to address the global climate challenge. Next Thursday, November 4, I will be speaking on our COP26 panel with executives from Microsoft and Wood discussing the digitization of the energy sector. This panel discussion will address how digital technologies are increasingly highlighted as key enablers to grow efficiencies across systems and to accelerate the technology development that is required to address demanding climate goals. Similarly, as we have mentioned before, Aspen Tech is an active member of the alliance to end plastic waste, supporting innovation to build a more sustainable global plastic value chain to create circularity. I'm actively involved on the Board of the Alliance and several Aspen Tech delegates participate in Alliance work groups and committees that are focused on regional plastic waste issues and technology development. Our contributions to the Alliance will continue by providing expertise in advanced recycling and modeling with our engineering suite and we expect to play an even greater role here as the Alliance advances towards achieving its mission of plastic circularity. I'd now like to talk about the pending transaction with Emerson. We believe this agreement offers compelling value for our customers and shareholders and positions new Aspen Tech as the leading industrial software company. There are several compelling benefits of this combination. First new Aspen Tech will have the most comprehensive portfolio of mission-critical software products that span the entire capital asset life cycle. Aspen Tech's rich heritage in asset optimization will be extended and is strengthened with Emerson's grid energy management and advanced distribution management systems technology, and the geological simulation software. The software portfolios are highly complimentary and provide exciting upsell and cross-sell opportunities into our respective installed basis. Second, we will significantly diversify Aspen Tech's business and increase our total addressable market. New Aspen Tech will have an immediate leadership position in the power and utility transmission and distribution vertical and an enhanced portfolio to model the entire oil and gas supply chain and reservoir modeling capabilities for resource extraction and carbon capture and sequestration. Third, this combination will enhance our capabilities to support our customer sustainability initiatives. We have long had a critical role to play in our customer's efforts to operate assets safer, greener, faster and longer. The combined company will now be able to more fully support a broader array of sustainability initiatives, including electrification and carbon capture among others. Four, new Aspen Tech will have greater scale and a compelling financial profile with more than a $1 dollars in revenue and more than 3,000 global customers. We believe new Aspen Tech can be a consistent double digit grower with high recurrent revenue, best-in-class margins and substantial free cash flow. This increased scale and broader footprint will also make new Aspen Tech vehicle to pursue additional M&A in the future. Fifth, we will deepen our existing commercial relationship with Emerson, which will provide exciting new go-to-market opportunities for resell, co-sell and OEM of the entire suite of Aspen Tech products and solutions into all the industries where Emerson is installed, including those that Aspen Tech is targeting today through organic investments. The commercial relationship will also lead to joint package solutions and the development of next generation software capabilities. Finally, this transaction provides significant near and long-term value for our shareholders. Aspen Tech shareholders will receive $6 billion in cash and will own 45% of new Aspen Tech. This attractive structure will give our shareholders upfront liquidity and the opportunity to benefit from new Aspen Tech's increased scale, expanded growth opportunities and future margin expansion. A key aspect of this transaction will be converting the OSI and geological simulation software businesses to our token-based term license model. For those of you that were around when Aspen Tech first introduced our new commercial model in fiscal year 2010, you recall the significant improvements in growth, sales productivity, and user adoption that we experienced. We're confident we can deliver similar results this time as well. During our executive advisory board meeting that we hosted in Houston, following the announcement of the transaction with Emerson, we received a strong endorsement from those customer executives in attendance. They understood the synergies from the stump, a stronger relationship between the two companies, the possibilities for joint package solutions, and they even stronger ability. New Aspen tech will have to deliver sustainability solutions that can help transform their businesses. Let me finish by reinforcing how excited we are by the recent developments for Aspen tech and the future potential for new Aspen tech. Our core business is beginning to show signs of improvement and we're executing well on the growth investments we're making in product development and our go to market capabilities. When you put that together with a great software businesses that are being contributed to new Aspen tech and the deeper partnership with Emerson, we believe we have all the pieces in place to generate meeting's growth and reach $1.5 billion in annual spend in fiscal year 2026. My sentiment has only been reinforced and the most excited I've ever been about the future of Aspen Technology. Now, let me turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. As a reminder, these results are being reported under topic 6 0 6, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings and more specifically renewal a decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health. Our growth of our business, the timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years, and this non-linearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods and our view annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business and annual free cash flow. The most important metric for assessing the overall value, our business generates annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for our term license agreements. At the end of each period, the $630 million at the end of the first quarter, that's represented an increase of approximately 5.6% on a year-over-year basis. And 1.4% sequentially, total bookings, which are defined as the total value of customer term license contracts, where the associated term licenses were deemed delivered in the quarter under topic 606 was $128.2 million, a 30% increase year over year. Total revenue was $130 million for the first quarter, an 18% increase from the prior year period, turning to profitability beginning on a cap basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $81.3 million compared to $65.3 million in the year ago, period, this year over year increase in gap operating expenses was primarily driven by the ramp of new investments in our go to market organization and product development. In addition to the timing of equity grants and a related expenses, total expenses, including cost of revenue were $96.1 million, which was up from $80.8 million in the year ago, period operating income was 1330 $9.9 million in income for the quarter was $39.4 million or 58 cents per share. Now turning to non-gap results, excluding the impact of stock based compensation, expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition related fees. We reported non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter of $55.4 million representing a 40.7% non-GAAP operating margin compared to non-GAAP operating income margin at $42.7 million and 37.2% respectively in a year ago, period, as a reminder, margins will fluctuate period to period due to the timing of customer renewals and therefore license revenue recognized during the quarter non-GAAP net income was $51.6 million or $0.77 per share based on 67.4 million shares outstanding turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with approximately $248 million of cash and cash equivalents and 208 to $9 million outstanding under our credit facility. In the first quarter, we generated $32.7 million of cash from operations and $33 million of free cash flow. After taking to consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and acquisition related payments from a capital allocation perspective, we successfully completed our $150 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. During the quarter buying back 1.1 million shares, it is our intention to continue buying back up to 50 million of stock per quarter, subject to market conditions until the transaction Emerson, which is currently expected to occur by the end of the second quarter of calendar 2022, I would now like to close with respect to annual spent, we are maintaining our target of five to 7% annual spend growth. We are also maintaining our bookings guidance range of $766 million to $819 million. Our expected revenue range is also unchanged at $702 million to $737 million. As a reminder, we expect license revenue in the range of hundred and $81 million to $515 million and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $192 million and $30 million respectively from incense perspective, we now expect total gap expenses of 389 to $394 million taken together. We expect GAAP operating income in a range of $313 million to $343 million for fiscal 2022 with GAAP net income of approximately 285 to $311 million. We expect gap then income per share to be in the range of $4.19 to $4.67. From non-GAAP perspective, we continue to expect non-gap operating income of 361 to $391 million and not expect non-gap income per share in the range of $4.75 to $5. From a free cash flow perspective, we continue to expect free cash flow $275 million to $285 million. Our fiscal 2022 free cash flow guidance. It seems cash tax payments in the range of 60 to $66 million to wrap up Aspen tech delivered a strong first quarter performance. We are seeing positive signs of improvement in our business, and we are focused on building upon our success. In the first quarter, we are also incredibly excited at the future value creation opportunities that we believe will be possible with new Aspen Tech, which will have a broader product portfolio, greater end market diversification, and a deeper partnership with Emerson. We are confident that the strategic initiatives we are executing on will generate significant value for shareholders. And with that operator, let's begin the Q&A please.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Now, first question, coming from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAndrew Obin: Good morning. Good afternoon. It's been a long day for me. Sorry about that. Hey, how are you guys? So you highlighted the spend in the quarter was about expectations. What would make you guys comfortable in terms of what kind of benchmarks or for you to raise guidance? Is it just seeing it for a couple more quarters? Are you looking at any specific industry events? You sound better, but I appreciate it the first quarter, but you haven't raised guidance. So if you could expand on that. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Yeah, I, Andrew and Michelle can supplement what I say as well. Look as I like to say one data point doesn't make a trend, but certainly if you look at the macro KPIs, we track, they're all open to the right price of oil, refining margins, chemicals production and chemicals margin, chemicals demand, and chemicals margins and even with EPC as well, while certainly there's been a significant reduction in CapEx, it's already been almost a year and we believe that the situation there is stabilizing but we have to work to the contract. So, we're being cautious, as I said. We're maintaining our guidance for now and as we see the year progress, we'll make the appropriate decisions at the time.\nAndrew Obin: And just a follow up question, it seems that really are a lot of opportunities to integrate the channel with Emerson. How long do you think it will take to start seeing the impact in your numbers from this better integration?\nAntonio Pietri: Look as we said, when we announced the transaction we expect to close a transaction in the second calendar quarter of 2022. And then we will start working on executing our integration plans and with what's agreed on the commercial agreement between the two companies. So, certainly hope, if you think about timing, you're looking out Q4 fiscal '22 for Aspen Tech July 1, next year is fiscal '23. So we would expect that perhaps we start to see some of those benefits later in fiscal '23, then into '24, '25. So\u2026\nAndrew Obin: Well, good to see the things improving. Congratulations on the deal.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, Andrew.\nOperator: Now, next question coming from the line of Rob Oliver [ph] with Barrick. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey Antonio. Hi, Chantelle, thanks for taking my questions. My first one is on, Antonio, your comments around some of the pockets of improvement that you're seeing within your end markets. So I wanted to dig in a little bit deeper on that. It sounds, based on what you said that, core on owner operators are seeing the most movement, but there are pockets within cams. I'm just curious, if you can elaborate a little bit more on some of that and maybe within cams, what some of the puts and takes are there. And then just as a corollary what, you've certainly -- commodity prices up into the right at the same time we're experiencing some major global supply chain issues. So just curious how we balance those factors relative to your core customers and how we think about annual spend for the remainder of the year and then I had a follow-up.\nAntonio Pietri: Yeah, sure. Well, if you look at refining and the opening up of economies around the world there's definitely been a material change and, and automobile traffic which is driven higher consumption of fuels. Refining margins in the last few months have tripled and really does put him at the, at the low end of their historical margin range there, these are not record margins, but now they're within the historical range, which is, which is very good on, on talking to our refining customers. They are very optimistic about that. So that's been a marked change from, from three months ago, let's say and that's why I think we've seen the performance in, in refining that we saw in our Q1 quarter on, came on the chemical side. Look, if you only have to look at the announcements from chemical companies record margins and cash flow generation and certainly, there's cautiousness within that customer sector around supply chain issues dampening demand for their products and that's something to keep an eye on and they're still sectors small sectors, but they're still sectors within the chemicals industry that are not doing as well as they were doing before the pandemic but on the whole ball chemicals which is ethylene and polymers has done very well in this calendar year. So, if you look at those two, global economic growth continuing to drive demand and so on, I think the outlook is positive and then EPC is, and even with EPC is look, UPC is, are going through their own transformation. They're focusing a lot more on sustainability areas such as hydrogen and biofuels and others, which I think over time will, will make that industry a healthier industry. And I would say that now you're starting to see the debate develop over the last week or two around whether the oil industry is spending enough topics to supply global demand over the next few years. And that's a real issue. That's that? That was a concern frankly, back in '18, '19, he got exacerbated over the last 12 to 18 months with a Kohl's for reduced investments in oil and gas. And, the real question here will be whether the, you know the, the sustained level of cap expand we'll, we'll, we'll facilitate balance demand supply scenario going forward. So, look overall good, but, you know I think we need to be cautious, and it's still a very fluid environment.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah, that's helpful.\nChantelle Breithaupt: And if I could add, I'm sorry, Rob. I was going add yeah, no worries. I think that so very much agree with Antonio's thought around, you know, operating our customers operating in their day to day environments will the pressure of supply chain. The other thing back to the question on annual spend, how we see it going forward is we're also waiting for this calendar or flip on sustainability. This is a topic with new funding and new importance for our customers. So that's another signal we're waiting to see outside our regular, you know, kind of metrics of we look at. And so that's another thing going into our Q2. We're looking for, just to give you some additional.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's really helpful for both of you guys and I'll just make my follow up a quick one, even though I, I wanted to ask a bunch about Jefferson, but it's probably a broader discussion, but just, I, know Chantelle, Antonio referred to the attrition number, but I just want to make sure we got the exact number because I know it wasn't in the press release. And what was the attrition this quarter and, and you, what do you expect it to be for the remainder of the year?\nAntonio Pietri: What I can share with you Rob, is that we're sticking to the guide we have in Q4 of 6% attrition for the year.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Matthew Pfau with William Blair. Your line is open.\nMatthew Pfau: I guess. Thanks for taking my questions wanted of to first follow up on, on the sustainability comments and how is there any way to, to guess how many of your deals today are driven by sustainability initiatives and then Chantelle your comments was that related to maybe the anticipation of some of your customers carving out budgets specifically related to investing in technologies that that help achieve their sustainability initiatives.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yeah. Maybe I can start with the second and Antonio we can work on the first one together. Yes, absolutely, when Antonio referred to the executive advisory customer meeting that we had in Houston a few weeks back you can hear customers speak of kind of two budgets that they're working in as they go forward. One is their operating Catholic office and the other is either guided from their board or their shareholders, their own is to spend more on sustainability and how that rearranges in the company is yet to be seen. But we definitely two conversations emerging in the sense of what the customers will be focused spending their funds on.\nAntonio Pietri: Yeah. Matt, in a way for a lot of customers, as, as they've said, they're net zero carbon emission goals that, that overarching initiative and ambition is, driving the thought process and prioritization of investments in inside these companies and, and the expectation through some of our own research survey, surveying customers, where corporate sustainability will probably be a top influencer on software spend over the next few years especially in the areas of analytics and, and, and benchmarking. So, we're pretty optimistic about this and, and, and, and, and what we do every day is, is about creating efficiencies that reduce and missions or plastic waste or reduce the consumption of, you know, water and so on. So, so we, these coupled with the assets that we're getting from Amazon around global electrification and, and the ability to model for carbon capture and sequestration we'll open, we just opened up tremendous opportunities for Aspen Technology. And by the way that reserve for modeling capability that we're also getting from in the geological simulation software business we'll also be able to take into mining for, or for modeling of rock formations and, and, and resources. So very exciting stuff.\nMatthew Pfau: Got it. And then just wanted to ask on ETM and how that performed in, in the quarter and, and, and related maybe you know, an update on what you saw in pharma and metals and mine in as well.\nAntonio Pietri: Yeah, look so we give you an update on APM every six months and, and, and we, we continue to sign APM customers. I'll say that we were seeing also better progress in, in Asia with our APM solutions. And at the same time look we've learned a lot over the last 18 to 24 months as the market adjusted, as a solution has been implementing our customers environments and what they're looking for and, and how we need to add capabilities to a solution. So, so there's we're also while excited about what we're seeing in the market, we're also working to, to continue to deliver innovation in the solution that, that we believe will, will strengthen the, not only strengthen the suite, but also Aspen, which is, I know where the question is or is focused on. So but we'll give you an update when we report the Q2 results in, in January.\nMatthew Pfau: Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question, coming from Jackson Ader with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJackson Ader: My questions guys, and Antonio. So the bookings and number if you net out the, the bookings up for renewal, if you want to call that kind of gross bookings or, or gross bookings or something was, was up a bunch year over year, and I'm just curious, you know, how much that had to do with maybe some easy comparisons. I remember a year ago, you mentioned that customers in the first quarter just didn't really want to have conversations with you in July and August versus maybe some upside in execution or, or net new demand or net new interest, just what drove that growth, booking speed,\nAntonio Pietri: Chantel, you want to take that or do you like me to take it?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Well, I can start, certainly. I think that I would actually, one of the things I think that we're proud of is the fact that we are seeing that gross growth to your point Jackson. So I think it's a great point to highlight, I think that if you look at some of the areas, we see the growth, you know, we talked about the MSC growth and maybe Antonio, you wanted to give some more, more color on from the customer viewpoint or end market viewpoint.\nAntonio Pietri: Yeah, yeah, no about Jackson in a way. It is very simple, we over-performed in Q1. We in August, we told you meaning investors in general and the market that that we felt we were going to have a quarter that was going to grow where growth was going to be dampen by the amount of attrition that, that we saw coming in the quarter as a result of, of a number of a larger number of engineering renewals, EMC renewals that all happened. And, and there was a larger accumulation of that, but we also saw tremendous growth on the MSC. I gross growth and, and that accounts for a lot of that over performance in, in bookings as well. So, so it's, it's a combination of multiple factors, but certainly the, the, the MSC over performance helped in, in that regard. Yeah. And I think, to that point, Jackson, it's what we're, what we're triangulating is that the pen up demand, but now it's flowing through that me to get back to their steady states. And, you know, some of that, some of that pressure is being released through this gross growth is how I would articulate it.\nJackson Ader: Yeah and then just a quick follow up on the MSC. Well, I guess it's really chemicals. Is there any way to quantify what type of a headwind the, the chemicals piece is at the moment so that we can get a sense for, you know, the, what we would expect that, that normalized MSC growth might look like without the, the supply chain headwind?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, look, so at the moment we're not seeing if, if you talk to chemical customers, they are not yet seeing a headwind and at least anecdotally talking to them they will be announcing you know, very on results for the September quarter. There is a certain level of concern with regards to, you know, the supply chain issues, getting worse and, and having an impact on demand for their products, but it's not something that they have seen and they're not able to quantify themselves and that is what they, it would even show up. So, look I think in the overall I'm looking, I'm focusing a lot more on economic growth across the bull and how that will continue to drive demand for all sorts of products you know regardless of the supply chain. So,\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our next question, coming from the line of [indiscernible] with Berenberg. You line is open?\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, thank you for taking my questions. The first one is just in terms of the MST parts of the business clearly performing. Well, the question for me is what has changed is the confidence. This is the main reason here. And then you guys mentioned kind of pan up demand. It's starting to kick in. Do you have an idea of how much of that pant up demand is last for the year? In other words, this isn't kind of a one quarter phenomenon that you're right.\nAntonio Pietri: Well, look, I'll look again, you can only in a way that that's a, that's a hard question to answer. Okay. what, how much pen up the money is left, but I can point you to the last time we troughed in '17, when we troughed at 4.1, the following year was 6.4. And when we had two consecutive years of normal budgets we went from 6.4% to 10.6% growth. And, in my opinion, a, a lot of that is initially driven by pen top demand, and then it, it normalizes a, a double digit growth. That's, my point of view. So I think what we're if history is an indication of, of the future, I think what we're seeing is again, back to a release of, of a spending to do a catch up on technology implementation that will eventually normalize at, at a higher level. Once we have two years of consecutive, oh, two consecutive years of good budgets. And to me that will be calendar '22 and calendar '23.\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. And then just on the flip side on the ENC, obviously that have a lot of renewals this this year, so you is still kind of guiding for this high churn. But would you expect that to kind of work through and, and, and the, and the budgets are also recovered based on the, based on what you're seeing in the end market right now? Or is it more like a two year process that if the oil prices remains stable and we might see more cut budgets being untied into the next year, and we'll probably need to wait for that in order to kind of get the confidence\nAntonio Pietri: Look at this is a very good question and the thing about the demand and supply and macro trends is that you have to give time, time, meaning you have to let time pass to for things to prove themselves out and this narrative that, that cap expand in the oil and gas industry was at a level that wasn't sustainable for future demand has been a narrative. Now that narrative has been overwhelmed by certainly climate change and sustainability. They focus on renewables, which is all important and, and, and necessary. But look at energy transitions happen over a long period of time and in this context there's a sense that you know, that we could be facing a very tight supply demand balance, which could accelerate or continue to drive all prices up which by the way, I don't, I don't think is necessarily healthy because it may impact economic at some point. So, so on a personal basis, a rather, or sea oil somewhere between, around $70 a barrel, but, but what having settled that, what this could all mean is that some companies or countries do see an incentive to start spending, putting more CapEx to work because they see an opportunity to, to supply more to the market than the road. So, so we'll see we'll see. But at the same time, look out of the last recall from 1617, what we saw was low single digit CapEx growth to meet single digit, really 5% at the, at the high end. And, that was enough for, for, for our growth to accelerate back to double digit with the contribution from our APM suite. Today we have a lot more things in play, not only APM, but I T pharma mining, but also the Emerson relationship the contribution of this assets, the OSI assets and the GSS assets and the, and the, and this commercial relationship with Emerson, the, that will be so comprehensive and global, that that will, will, will support an acceleration of our growth rate. So, look I'm all the KPIs are look good. We've signed transformation transaction that will support our growth and, and diversify our, our business going forward as well. So I said it, look, my closing statement was I I'm the most excited about our future than I've ever been and, and, and remain so.\nUnidentified Analyst: Perfect. Thank you so much for your answers.\nAntonio Pietri: Yeah. I just want to, before the next I want to highlight to Jackson's comment or question around supply chains and chemicals look one of the things that's happened as well over the last 18 months with COVID is of supply chains around the world, not only the ones ensuring of production and sites, but also the reconfiguration of the supply chains and really building resiliency into supply chains in preparation for future disruptions. So we are seeing in much greater interest from chemical companies on supply chain management capability, supply chain logistics the concept of the control tower. And this is certainly opening up a whole and an increased area of investments by chemical companies around other supply chain but also other companies by the way, pharmaceuticals and including oil and oil companies. So, I think this whole the whole discussion around supply chains is one that actually will be a tailwind for Aspen technology as well.\nOperator: The next question coming from the line of Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nJason Celino: Hi, just a couple questions for me. So Q1 has seasonally been the weakest growth quarter? This Q1 biggest influential increase that we've seen in two years, actually, maybe, can you talk about the linearity of the strength how it might have stuck started before you started seeing it kind of any that would be great. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Yeah. Look again, no doubt. Q1 by nature have, are the sort of lowest growth quarters the lowest growth quarter that we normally have. And well, we just had a very strong Q1, especially considering the attrition that we experienced, the amount of cross growth that was generated this quarter in Q1 was look there, there was also I'll say an easy comp versus Q1 FY '21 as well. Look Q2 tend to be stronger quarters historically than Q1 and then it into Q3 and Q4, normally being our strongest quarters, just because it's the end of a fiscal year. Normally, our sales cycle is nine to 12 months. And the sales organization is gearing for, to exceed their quarters and getting to accelerators for commission. So that's let that's how I would view it. But, I also want to be cautious here. But yes, we're happy about Q1. I'll take this Q1 versus last.\nJason Celino: Well, what I was really trying to understand is how the quarter improved throughout, throughout the quarter. Oh, sorry.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yeah. I think that's a, yeah. So, sorry. I was going to just add to Antonio's comment. I think that you were, you know, the attrition, most of the renewals activity to your point is in the same hockey stick as every other company. So that's a third quarter, but I would say, from the beginning pipeline to the conversion through the quarter, I would say that probably mid to later, we started to really solidify those conversations with our customers. But we were definitely out of the gate Q4 having the gross growth conversations. But you know, it takes time and it still has the top approvals that Antonio referred to. So you don't really see that momentum Jason until the second, third month.\nAntonio Pietri: Yeah. Perfect. No, sorry, Jason. MIS I misunderstood your question. Look, no worries. The one new ones, the one new ones about Q1 are Q1 quarter, September is July and August are heavy vacation months. And, and really is, is the first few days of September when a business activity begins to accelerate. So, so tends to be a quarter where that is very concentrated into four weeks in September. And, it was a great four weeks.\nJason Celino: Perfect. That is very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would not like to send a call back over to Ms. Antonio Pietri for any closing remarks.\nAntonio Pietri: All right. Well thank you everyone for joining today's call and we look forward to again participating in event and hopefully starting to meet some of you in person, which we've started to do with customers and, and is a very different experience to be meeting customers in person than over video. So hopefully we'll start seeing some of you in person in the future. Thank you everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. As a reminder, these results are being reported under topic 6 0 6, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings and more specifically renewal a decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health. Our growth of our business, the timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years, and this non-linearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a result, we believe our income statement will provide an inconsistent view into our financial performance, especially when comparing between fiscal periods and our view annual spend will continue to be the most important metric in assessing the growth of our business and annual free cash flow. The most important metric for assessing the overall value, our business generates annual spend, which represents the accumulated value of all the current invoices for our term license agreements. At the end of each period, the $630 million at the end of the first quarter, that's represented an increase of approximately 5.6% on a year-over-year basis. And 1.4% sequentially, total bookings, which are defined as the total value of customer term license contracts, where the associated term licenses were deemed delivered in the quarter under topic 606 was $128.2 million, a 30% increase year over year. Total revenue was $130 million for the first quarter, an 18% increase from the prior year period, turning to profitability beginning on a cap basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $81.3 million compared to $65.3 million in the year ago, period, this year over year increase in gap operating expenses was primarily driven by the ramp of new investments in our go to market organization and product development. In addition to the timing of equity grants and a related expenses, total expenses, including cost of revenue were $96.1 million, which was up from $80.8 million in the year ago, period operating income was 1330 $9.9 million in income for the quarter was $39.4 million or 58 cents per share. Now turning to non-gap results, excluding the impact of stock based compensation, expense, amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition related fees. We reported non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter of $55.4 million representing a 40.7% non-GAAP operating margin compared to non-GAAP operating income margin at $42.7 million and 37.2% respectively in a year ago, period, as a reminder, margins will fluctuate period to period due to the timing of customer renewals and therefore license revenue recognized during the quarter non-GAAP net income was $51.6 million or $0.77 per share based on 67.4 million shares outstanding turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with approximately $248 million of cash and cash equivalents and 208 to $9 million outstanding under our credit facility. In the first quarter, we generated $32.7 million of cash from operations and $33 million of free cash flow. After taking to consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and acquisition related payments from a capital allocation perspective, we successfully completed our $150 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. During the quarter buying back 1.1 million shares, it is our intention to continue buying back up to 50 million of stock per quarter, subject to market conditions until the transaction Emerson, which is currently expected to occur by the end of the second quarter of calendar 2022, I would now like to close with respect to annual spent, we are maintaining our target of five to 7% annual spend growth. We are also maintaining our bookings guidance range of $766 million to $819 million. Our expected revenue range is also unchanged at $702 million to $737 million. As a reminder, we expect license revenue in the range of hundred and $81 million to $515 million and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $192 million and $30 million respectively from incense perspective, we now expect total gap expenses of 389 to $394 million taken together. We expect GAAP operating income in a range of $313 million to $343 million for fiscal 2022 with GAAP net income of approximately 285 to $311 million. We expect gap then income per share to be in the range of $4.19 to $4.67. From non-GAAP perspective, we continue to expect non-gap operating income of 361 to $391 million and not expect non-gap income per share in the range of $4.75 to $5. From a free cash flow perspective, we continue to expect free cash flow $275 million to $285 million. Our fiscal 2022 free cash flow guidance. It seems cash tax payments in the range of 60 to $66 million to wrap up Aspen tech delivered a strong first quarter performance. We are seeing positive signs of improvement in our business, and we are focused on building upon our success. In the first quarter, we are also incredibly excited at the future value creation opportunities that we believe will be possible with new Aspen Tech, which will have a broader product portfolio, greater end market diversification, and a deeper partnership with Emerson. We are confident that the strategic initiatives we are executing on will generate significant value for shareholders. And with that operator, let's begin the Q&A please. And if I could add, I'm sorry, Rob. I was going add yeah, no worries. I think that so very much agree with Antonio's thought around, you know, operating our customers operating in their day to day environments will the pressure of supply chain. The other thing back to the question on annual spend, how we see it going forward is we're also waiting for this calendar or flip on sustainability. This is a topic with new funding and new importance for our customers. So that's another signal we're waiting to see outside our regular, you know, kind of metrics of we look at. And so that's another thing going into our Q2. We're looking for, just to give you some additional. Yeah. Maybe I can start with the second and Antonio we can work on the first one together. Yes, absolutely, when Antonio referred to the executive advisory customer meeting that we had in Houston a few weeks back you can hear customers speak of kind of two budgets that they're working in as they go forward. One is their operating Catholic office and the other is either guided from their board or their shareholders, their own is to spend more on sustainability and how that rearranges in the company is yet to be seen. But we definitely two conversations emerging in the sense of what the customers will be focused spending their funds on. Well, I can start, certainly. I think that I would actually, one of the things I think that we're proud of is the fact that we are seeing that gross growth to your point Jackson. So I think it's a great point to highlight, I think that if you look at some of the areas, we see the growth, you know, we talked about the MSC growth and maybe Antonio, you wanted to give some more, more color on from the customer viewpoint or end market viewpoint. Yeah. I think that's a, yeah. So, sorry. I was going to just add to Antonio's comment. I think that you were, you know, the attrition, most of the renewals activity to your point is in the same hockey stick as every other company. So that's a third quarter, but I would say, from the beginning pipeline to the conversion through the quarter, I would say that probably mid to later, we started to really solidify those conversations with our customers. But we were definitely out of the gate Q4 having the gross growth conversations. But you know, it takes time and it still has the top approvals that Antonio referred to. So you don't really see that momentum Jason until the second, third month."

            "name": "Antonio Pietri",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a strong start to the year with annual spend coming in above our expectations. We saw a notable improvement in the spending environment during the quarter as a continuing economic recovery has improved end market conditions for many of our customers. As we have discussed over the past 12 months, we have seen consistently strong demand indications from our customers about expanding adoption of Aspen Tech solutions to increase operational efficiency and sustainability. While the market is not yet back to pre-COVID levels we believe that first quarter was an important indicator that a spending by our customers is improving. More importantly, the recent announcement of our transaction with Emerson is a transformational moment for Aspen Tech. I'll discuss it in more detail later, but we cannot be more excited at the opportunity for the new Aspen Tech to deliver faster and greater value in sustainability, innovation and profitability to a broader set of customers. Looking quickly at our financial results in the first quarter, revenue was $136 million, GAAP EPS was $0.58 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.77. Annual spend was $630 million up 1.4% in the quarter and 5.6% year-over-year and free cash flow was $33 million. Looking at our first quarter performance in more detail, we saw clear signs of normalization in spending across our owner operator markets. In particular while the extra steps and scrutiny around the transaction approval process have remained in place, customer executives are noticeably more comfortable giving the final approval to transactions. We believe customers remain mindful of the fluidity with which market conditions can change, but the improved environment is enabling them to focus on the future, including how to deliver on their long-term and strategic objectives. We're optimistic this will be reflected in the CapEx and OpEx budgets for calendar 2022, that customers are now developing. Looking at the business by vertical, we saw the most notable improvement amongst our owner operator customers, but especially with refining customers spending by this customers grew our MSC business by 3.2% sequentially and 9% in the last 12 months just shy of its historical double-digit growth rate, which is a strong performance, especially when compared to the growth of the MSC business in fiscal year 2021 at 5.8%. As we mentioned on our last earnings call, we have seen a marked increase in the level of engagement with this customers in recent months about their future investment priorities. Our results in the quarter are an indication that improved conversations were signalling an improving sentiment from higher refining margins resulting in increased spending. Our chemicals business also performed better and continue to improve sequentially contributing to the acceleration of the MSC business. While overall trends are encouraging, there are still sectors of the chemical supply chains that are recovering from the linker and economic effects of COVID. We're confident chemicals will continue to be an important growth contributor going forward. Aspen Tech Solutions are essential to chemical customers' ability to achieve their operational and supply chain efficiencies and sustainability targets. Our E&C business performed as expected during the quarter. Conditions remained challenging and we have seen only modest improvements in CapEx and backlog trends. We expect this will be the part of the business that takes the longest to return to normal and we anticipate modest levels of growth from this customers for the foreseeable future. Attrition in the quarter was in line with our expectations, which if you recall, from our last earnings call was expected to be higher in the first quarter, given the timing of renewals this fiscal year. While we're optimistic about the improve spending environment and higher budgets in calendar 2022, we believe it is appropriate for now to maintain our guidance for growth in annual spend in the range of 5% to 7%. We're also maintaining our guidance for attrition in the year, which as we previously stated is mainly a reflection of the reduction in CapEx in the E&C space and elevated levels of renewables in our fiscal year 2022. Following are some notable wins from the quarter; first, a global energy company in the Middle East and a long time user of Aspen Tech's engineering and MSC suite signed an agreement to standardize on the use of Aspen Tech's PM [ph] solution for refining. After a rigorous process to evaluate the capabilities and incremental value creation opportunities of PM, the customer committed to standardize on the technology and executed on a global rollout of this technology. The deployment of PM is always expected to generate tens of millions of dollars of benefits for this customer. Second our US based multinational food processing and commodities trading company, user of our engineer and MSC suites has committed to roll out our recently released batch APC capabilities across their bioproducts manufacturing business. Bioproducts manufacturer, amino acids from core through fermentation. After a rigorous trial of the technology, the customer recognized sufficient value from improving production yields in their bioproducts manufacturing to commit to the technology. A new batch APC technology is expected to open up new use cases in batch production processes, as opposed to the continuous processes found in refining on bulk chemicals. We expect our batch PC technology to extend our reach further into specialty chemicals, bioprocesses pharma and other industries that use batch processing. Third and final customer reference, a US energy company and a subsidiary of a global Middle East energy company expanded the use of the engineer and MSC suites to execute on our comprehensive deployment of production planning and production operations optimization solutions to realize benefits in excess of $50 million per year in their manufacturing complex. The products involved are planning, scheduling dynamic optimization technology or GDOT, multi-variable process control and engineering suite. One of the key themes you've heard from Aspen Tech in recent years is our commitment to a sustainable future. To that end, in just a few days, Aspen Tech will join companies from around the world at COP26 to discuss and share solutions to address the global climate challenge. Next Thursday, November 4, I will be speaking on our COP26 panel with executives from Microsoft and Wood discussing the digitization of the energy sector. This panel discussion will address how digital technologies are increasingly highlighted as key enablers to grow efficiencies across systems and to accelerate the technology development that is required to address demanding climate goals. Similarly, as we have mentioned before, Aspen Tech is an active member of the alliance to end plastic waste, supporting innovation to build a more sustainable global plastic value chain to create circularity. I'm actively involved on the Board of the Alliance and several Aspen Tech delegates participate in Alliance work groups and committees that are focused on regional plastic waste issues and technology development. Our contributions to the Alliance will continue by providing expertise in advanced recycling and modeling with our engineering suite and we expect to play an even greater role here as the Alliance advances towards achieving its mission of plastic circularity. I'd now like to talk about the pending transaction with Emerson. We believe this agreement offers compelling value for our customers and shareholders and positions new Aspen Tech as the leading industrial software company. There are several compelling benefits of this combination. First new Aspen Tech will have the most comprehensive portfolio of mission-critical software products that span the entire capital asset life cycle. Aspen Tech's rich heritage in asset optimization will be extended and is strengthened with Emerson's grid energy management and advanced distribution management systems technology, and the geological simulation software. The software portfolios are highly complimentary and provide exciting upsell and cross-sell opportunities into our respective installed basis. Second, we will significantly diversify Aspen Tech's business and increase our total addressable market. New Aspen Tech will have an immediate leadership position in the power and utility transmission and distribution vertical and an enhanced portfolio to model the entire oil and gas supply chain and reservoir modeling capabilities for resource extraction and carbon capture and sequestration. Third, this combination will enhance our capabilities to support our customer sustainability initiatives. We have long had a critical role to play in our customer's efforts to operate assets safer, greener, faster and longer. The combined company will now be able to more fully support a broader array of sustainability initiatives, including electrification and carbon capture among others. Four, new Aspen Tech will have greater scale and a compelling financial profile with more than a $1 dollars in revenue and more than 3,000 global customers. We believe new Aspen Tech can be a consistent double digit grower with high recurrent revenue, best-in-class margins and substantial free cash flow. This increased scale and broader footprint will also make new Aspen Tech vehicle to pursue additional M&A in the future. Fifth, we will deepen our existing commercial relationship with Emerson, which will provide exciting new go-to-market opportunities for resell, co-sell and OEM of the entire suite of Aspen Tech products and solutions into all the industries where Emerson is installed, including those that Aspen Tech is targeting today through organic investments. The commercial relationship will also lead to joint package solutions and the development of next generation software capabilities. Finally, this transaction provides significant near and long-term value for our shareholders. Aspen Tech shareholders will receive $6 billion in cash and will own 45% of new Aspen Tech. This attractive structure will give our shareholders upfront liquidity and the opportunity to benefit from new Aspen Tech's increased scale, expanded growth opportunities and future margin expansion. A key aspect of this transaction will be converting the OSI and geological simulation software businesses to our token-based term license model. For those of you that were around when Aspen Tech first introduced our new commercial model in fiscal year 2010, you recall the significant improvements in growth, sales productivity, and user adoption that we experienced. We're confident we can deliver similar results this time as well. During our executive advisory board meeting that we hosted in Houston, following the announcement of the transaction with Emerson, we received a strong endorsement from those customer executives in attendance. They understood the synergies from the stump, a stronger relationship between the two companies, the possibilities for joint package solutions, and they even stronger ability. New Aspen tech will have to deliver sustainability solutions that can help transform their businesses. Let me finish by reinforcing how excited we are by the recent developments for Aspen tech and the future potential for new Aspen tech. Our core business is beginning to show signs of improvement and we're executing well on the growth investments we're making in product development and our go to market capabilities. When you put that together with a great software businesses that are being contributed to new Aspen tech and the deeper partnership with Emerson, we believe we have all the pieces in place to generate meeting's growth and reach $1.5 billion in annual spend in fiscal year 2026. My sentiment has only been reinforced and the most excited I've ever been about the future of Aspen Technology. Now, let me turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle. Yeah, I, Andrew and Michelle can supplement what I say as well. Look as I like to say one data point doesn't make a trend, but certainly if you look at the macro KPIs, we track, they're all open to the right price of oil, refining margins, chemicals production and chemicals margin, chemicals demand, and chemicals margins and even with EPC as well, while certainly there's been a significant reduction in CapEx, it's already been almost a year and we believe that the situation there is stabilizing but we have to work to the contract. So, we're being cautious, as I said. We're maintaining our guidance for now and as we see the year progress, we'll make the appropriate decisions at the time. Look as we said, when we announced the transaction we expect to close a transaction in the second calendar quarter of 2022. And then we will start working on executing our integration plans and with what's agreed on the commercial agreement between the two companies. So, certainly hope, if you think about timing, you're looking out Q4 fiscal '22 for Aspen Tech July 1, next year is fiscal '23. So we would expect that perhaps we start to see some of those benefits later in fiscal '23, then into '24, '25. So... Thank you, Andrew. Yeah, sure. Well, if you look at refining and the opening up of economies around the world there's definitely been a material change and, and automobile traffic which is driven higher consumption of fuels. Refining margins in the last few months have tripled and really does put him at the, at the low end of their historical margin range there, these are not record margins, but now they're within the historical range, which is, which is very good on, on talking to our refining customers. They are very optimistic about that. So that's been a marked change from, from three months ago, let's say and that's why I think we've seen the performance in, in refining that we saw in our Q1 quarter on, came on the chemical side. Look, if you only have to look at the announcements from chemical companies record margins and cash flow generation and certainly, there's cautiousness within that customer sector around supply chain issues dampening demand for their products and that's something to keep an eye on and they're still sectors small sectors, but they're still sectors within the chemicals industry that are not doing as well as they were doing before the pandemic but on the whole ball chemicals which is ethylene and polymers has done very well in this calendar year. So, if you look at those two, global economic growth continuing to drive demand and so on, I think the outlook is positive and then EPC is, and even with EPC is look, UPC is, are going through their own transformation. They're focusing a lot more on sustainability areas such as hydrogen and biofuels and others, which I think over time will, will make that industry a healthier industry. And I would say that now you're starting to see the debate develop over the last week or two around whether the oil industry is spending enough topics to supply global demand over the next few years. And that's a real issue. That's that? That was a concern frankly, back in '18, '19, he got exacerbated over the last 12 to 18 months with a Kohl's for reduced investments in oil and gas. And, the real question here will be whether the, you know the, the sustained level of cap expand we'll, we'll, we'll facilitate balance demand supply scenario going forward. So, look overall good, but, you know I think we need to be cautious, and it's still a very fluid environment. What I can share with you Rob, is that we're sticking to the guide we have in Q4 of 6% attrition for the year. Yeah. Matt, in a way for a lot of customers, as, as they've said, they're net zero carbon emission goals that, that overarching initiative and ambition is, driving the thought process and prioritization of investments in inside these companies and, and the expectation through some of our own research survey, surveying customers, where corporate sustainability will probably be a top influencer on software spend over the next few years especially in the areas of analytics and, and, and benchmarking. So, we're pretty optimistic about this and, and, and, and, and what we do every day is, is about creating efficiencies that reduce and missions or plastic waste or reduce the consumption of, you know, water and so on. So, so we, these coupled with the assets that we're getting from Amazon around global electrification and, and the ability to model for carbon capture and sequestration we'll open, we just opened up tremendous opportunities for Aspen Technology. And by the way that reserve for modeling capability that we're also getting from in the geological simulation software business we'll also be able to take into mining for, or for modeling of rock formations and, and, and resources. So very exciting stuff. Yeah, look so we give you an update on APM every six months and, and, and we, we continue to sign APM customers. I'll say that we were seeing also better progress in, in Asia with our APM solutions. And at the same time look we've learned a lot over the last 18 to 24 months as the market adjusted, as a solution has been implementing our customers environments and what they're looking for and, and how we need to add capabilities to a solution. So, so there's we're also while excited about what we're seeing in the market, we're also working to, to continue to deliver innovation in the solution that, that we believe will, will strengthen the, not only strengthen the suite, but also Aspen, which is, I know where the question is or is focused on. So but we'll give you an update when we report the Q2 results in, in January. Chantel, you want to take that or do you like me to take it? Yeah, yeah, no about Jackson in a way. It is very simple, we over-performed in Q1. We in August, we told you meaning investors in general and the market that that we felt we were going to have a quarter that was going to grow where growth was going to be dampen by the amount of attrition that, that we saw coming in the quarter as a result of, of a number of a larger number of engineering renewals, EMC renewals that all happened. And, and there was a larger accumulation of that, but we also saw tremendous growth on the MSC. I gross growth and, and that accounts for a lot of that over performance in, in bookings as well. So, so it's, it's a combination of multiple factors, but certainly the, the, the MSC over performance helped in, in that regard. Yeah. And I think, to that point, Jackson, it's what we're, what we're triangulating is that the pen up demand, but now it's flowing through that me to get back to their steady states. And, you know, some of that, some of that pressure is being released through this gross growth is how I would articulate it. Well, look, so at the moment we're not seeing if, if you talk to chemical customers, they are not yet seeing a headwind and at least anecdotally talking to them they will be announcing you know, very on results for the September quarter. There is a certain level of concern with regards to, you know, the supply chain issues, getting worse and, and having an impact on demand for their products, but it's not something that they have seen and they're not able to quantify themselves and that is what they, it would even show up. So, look I think in the overall I'm looking, I'm focusing a lot more on economic growth across the bull and how that will continue to drive demand for all sorts of products you know regardless of the supply chain. So, Well, look, I'll look again, you can only in a way that that's a, that's a hard question to answer. Okay. what, how much pen up the money is left, but I can point you to the last time we troughed in '17, when we troughed at 4.1, the following year was 6.4. And when we had two consecutive years of normal budgets we went from 6.4% to 10.6% growth. And, in my opinion, a, a lot of that is initially driven by pen top demand, and then it, it normalizes a, a double digit growth. That's, my point of view. So I think what we're if history is an indication of, of the future, I think what we're seeing is again, back to a release of, of a spending to do a catch up on technology implementation that will eventually normalize at, at a higher level. Once we have two years of consecutive, oh, two consecutive years of good budgets. And to me that will be calendar '22 and calendar '23. Look at this is a very good question and the thing about the demand and supply and macro trends is that you have to give time, time, meaning you have to let time pass to for things to prove themselves out and this narrative that, that cap expand in the oil and gas industry was at a level that wasn't sustainable for future demand has been a narrative. Now that narrative has been overwhelmed by certainly climate change and sustainability. They focus on renewables, which is all important and, and, and necessary. But look at energy transitions happen over a long period of time and in this context there's a sense that you know, that we could be facing a very tight supply demand balance, which could accelerate or continue to drive all prices up which by the way, I don't, I don't think is necessarily healthy because it may impact economic at some point. So, so on a personal basis, a rather, or sea oil somewhere between, around $70 a barrel, but, but what having settled that, what this could all mean is that some companies or countries do see an incentive to start spending, putting more CapEx to work because they see an opportunity to, to supply more to the market than the road. So, so we'll see we'll see. But at the same time, look out of the last recall from 1617, what we saw was low single digit CapEx growth to meet single digit, really 5% at the, at the high end. And, that was enough for, for, for our growth to accelerate back to double digit with the contribution from our APM suite. Today we have a lot more things in play, not only APM, but I T pharma mining, but also the Emerson relationship the contribution of this assets, the OSI assets and the GSS assets and the, and the, and this commercial relationship with Emerson, the, that will be so comprehensive and global, that that will, will, will support an acceleration of our growth rate. So, look I'm all the KPIs are look good. We've signed transformation transaction that will support our growth and, and diversify our, our business going forward as well. So I said it, look, my closing statement was I I'm the most excited about our future than I've ever been and, and, and remain so. Yeah. I just want to, before the next I want to highlight to Jackson's comment or question around supply chains and chemicals look one of the things that's happened as well over the last 18 months with COVID is of supply chains around the world, not only the ones ensuring of production and sites, but also the reconfiguration of the supply chains and really building resiliency into supply chains in preparation for future disruptions. So we are seeing in much greater interest from chemical companies on supply chain management capability, supply chain logistics the concept of the control tower. And this is certainly opening up a whole and an increased area of investments by chemical companies around other supply chain but also other companies by the way, pharmaceuticals and including oil and oil companies. So, I think this whole the whole discussion around supply chains is one that actually will be a tailwind for Aspen technology as well. Yeah. Look again, no doubt. Q1 by nature have, are the sort of lowest growth quarters the lowest growth quarter that we normally have. And well, we just had a very strong Q1, especially considering the attrition that we experienced, the amount of cross growth that was generated this quarter in Q1 was look there, there was also I'll say an easy comp versus Q1 FY '21 as well. Look Q2 tend to be stronger quarters historically than Q1 and then it into Q3 and Q4, normally being our strongest quarters, just because it's the end of a fiscal year. Normally, our sales cycle is nine to 12 months. And the sales organization is gearing for, to exceed their quarters and getting to accelerators for commission. So that's let that's how I would view it. But, I also want to be cautious here. But yes, we're happy about Q1. I'll take this Q1 versus last. Yeah. Perfect. No, sorry, Jason. MIS I misunderstood your question. Look, no worries. The one new ones, the one new ones about Q1 are Q1 quarter, September is July and August are heavy vacation months. And, and really is, is the first few days of September when a business activity begins to accelerate. So, so tends to be a quarter where that is very concentrated into four weeks in September. And, it was a great four weeks. All right. Well thank you everyone for joining today's call and we look forward to again participating in event and hopefully starting to meet some of you in person, which we've started to do with customers and, and is a very different experience to be meeting customers in person than over video. So hopefully we'll start seeing some of you in person in the future. Thank you everyone."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Brian Denyeau from ICR. Your line is now open.\nBrian Denyeau: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2023 ending June 30, 2023. With me on the call today are Antonio Pietri, AspenTech\u2019s President and CEO; and Chantelle Breithaupt, AspenTech\u2019s CFO. Please note, we have developed an expanded earnings presentation for the fourth quarter and our fiscal year 2023. This presentation is now posted on our IR website, and we ask that investors to refer to this presentation in conjunction with today\u2019s call. Starting on slide 2. Before we begin, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today\u2019s press release and in our annual report on Form 10-KT, other subsequent filings made with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this presentation, we present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s earnings press release and investor presentation, both of which are available on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks, Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Let me open by thanking our investors for their thoughtful feedback and suggestions regarding our earnings materials, which are reflected in the structure of today\u2019s prepared remarks as well as our updated earnings presentation. Beginning on slide 3. We achieved several important milestones in the quarter and fiscal year to help lay the foundation for AspenTech to enter our next growth stage as a leading global industrial software player. First, we delivered a solid fourth quarter to close out a successful year, marked by resilient demand and ACV growth above the midpoint of our guidance range. We believe these results have successfully laid the groundwork for a promising fiscal \u201824 and position AspenTech well for future ACV growth and free cash flow margin expansion over time. Second, we made substantial progress integrating and transforming OSI and SSE, and we\u2019re pleased with how well this business has fit into our product portfolio, given how early we are in our journey with these assets. We\u2019re excited about the enhanced value proposition our solutions can now provide customers across energy, chemicals, EPCs and utilities, among other industries. Third, we built the teams, processes and systems to capture growth synergies between Emerson and AspenTech and establish a cadence between organizations to execute on these opportunities going forward. And finally, we remain focused on R&D and co-innovation with the strategic partners and customers. Our efforts to advance use cases in support of our customer sustainability strategies show incredible promise and have been well received by customers. Q4 was a strong finish to an important year and show the benefits of our transformation efforts and learnings. Fiscal \u201823 annual contract value was $884.9 million, representing double-digit growth of 11.8% year-over-year. While fiscal \u201823 free cash flow was $292.3 million. Chantelle will address our free cash flow performance in her remarks. Turning to slide 4. I\u2019ll walk through our suite performance. In the quarter and throughout the year, demand in most of our end markets and geographies was strong. Our performance this year against the backdrop of an unpredictable macro environment is an important reminder of the mission criticality of AspenTech solutions to our customers\u2019 operations and strategic priorities. I\u2019ll touch now on the key high-level themes we\u2019re seeing across our suites. First, Heritage AspenTech performed well, contributing 7.2 points of growth on an ACV basis. Our engineering suite outperformed this year, driven by an improving business environment for EPC customers after years of restructuring in the industry and a strong energy market. We also saw material growth contribution from new customers that are benefiting from or investing in sustainability-related projects. We believe these new customers represent a classic land-and-expand opportunity for our other suites in the future. MSC performance was in line with our commentary from the third quarter, benefiting from refining market strength. Chemical demand remained subdued in the fourth quarter, particularly for bulk chemical producers as companies continue working through destoking and the impact from an uncertain economic outlook. This dynamic is having a more pronounced impact on OpEx spend for chemicals customers which drives most of our chemicals business. Our expectation is this trend will now last at least through the end of the calendar year based on recent market commentary from customers. APM\u2019s performance came in at the lower end of our guidance range for fiscal \u201823 and reflected a continuation of the trend we have experienced in recent years. While APM represents a relatively small portion of our overall business, we continue to believe in its growth potential and remain committed to building out its capabilities to better capitalize on opportunities in certain markets. On that note, I\u2019m pleased to announce that we recently closed a tuck-in IP acquisition that will provide additional failure mode and effects analysis and new root cause analysis capabilities, in short, FMEA and RCA capabilities to our Mtell product. This will strengthen Mtell\u2019s existing use cases and help to further expand its reach into other industries such as power and transmission and distribution. The SSE and DGM suite of products were both successful in their first year as part of new AspenTech, exceeding our anticipated point of ACV growth contribution by 60 basis points in total. SSE had an exceptional fiscal \u201823 and was the largest area of outperformance for the year. The offset was driven in large part by the positive impact of initial transformation synergies, including the establishment of minimum contract lengths and Heritage AspenTech-like contract terms and conditions as well as better-than-expected demand. SSE\u2019s performance this year reinforces the attractiveness of our full life cycle solution that supports both, traditional oil and gas E&P for upstream customers as well as an increasing number of sustainability use cases. DGM sales delivered a solid Q4 performance and we are pleased with its sales activity outside of North America. Historically, DGM has been focused on the U.S. and its ability to leverage AspenTech\u2019s global expertise and capabilities is an important driver of our growth strategy in fiscal \u201824 and beyond. Furthermore, the imperative to expand the grid to achieve global electrification and the funds committed globally by governments to this effort will accelerate the demand environment for the DGM suite. Turning now to slide 5. In fiscal \u201823, we built the foundation of new AspenTech while delivering solid financial results. In the span of 13 months, we made significant progress bringing OSI, SSE and Heritage AspenTech together. We successfully integrated this business\u2019s sales, marketing, finance and product development teams, among other areas to create a fully unified organization. We also completed our acquisition of inmation, which, combined with our industrial IoT offerings, forms what we now refer to as DataWorks. On the synergies front, our results reflect early success in realizing our objectives as part of the Emerson transaction. We are on track to achieve the $110 million of EBITDA synergies which includes $40 million in cost synergies. In particular, we have made significant progress in laying the foundation for our joint go-to-market strategies with Emerson. We\u2019re excited about the increasing opportunities we see to jointly expand business in either AspenTech or Emerson accounts as well as co-innovation and OEM [ph] collaboration. Emerson brings a unique and complementary skill set to our industrial software focus, and we\u2019re aligned on execution and priorities going forward. Importantly, we also executed the planned transformation work for fiscal \u201823 related to OSI and SSE. Having done all of this and because of it, we remain confident in our execution plan and the time line to achieve the anticipated outcomes from these business\u2019s transformation. As an example, in the case of OSI, we\u2019re building out OSI\u2019s third-party implementation services providers\u2019 network to support a secular increase in demand and as part of the business model evolution towards a software-centric business like Heritage AspenTech. We\u2019re also receiving encouraging early receptivity to our DGM term license model from utility customers as we introduced an alternative to perpetual software licensing. And we have completed the work to make the DGM suite token-ready to introduce to the market soon. As we discuss on slide 6, we continue to see the mega trends of the energy transition and global electrification as important drivers of our business, particularly related to sustainability projects. That said, I\u2019d like to take a moment now to discuss how we\u2019re positioned to capitalize on the sustainability pathway opportunities, many of which have been expanded through our transaction with Emerson. First, Heritage AspenTech\u2019s capabilities across all three suites are uniquely positioned to drive energy efficiencies and profitability in our customers\u2019 existing asset operations. While also addressing a growing number of energy transition use cases around biofuels production, carbon capture and sequestration, the hydrogen supply chain, electrical batteries, engineering design and recycling process design, direct air carbon capture systems and more. In fiscal \u201823, we already started to see material benefits from sustainability efforts in our engineering suite. In DGM, many customers are using our Monarch SCADA platform to help manage oil and gas distribution systems, supply and demand management for solar, wind and hydropower electricity, and a broad array of key resources, supply and demand management networks such as [indiscernible]. Chemicals and refining customers are also showing heightened interest in micro grid management capabilities, presenting us with the opportunity to cross-sell our DGM suite into these markets. Meanwhile, in SSE, we are seeing interest in geothermal energy production, carbon capture sequestration, subsurface, hydrogen storage and other sustainability use cases that are happening faster than we originally anticipated in certain parts of the world. Now, more than ever, AspenTech is well positioned to drive existing customer growth, win new logos and gain market share through the sustainability-related opportunities. As you can see on slide 7, we\u2019re investing in R&D and co-innovation partnership to build out additional sustainability capabilities in our products to enhance our first-mover advantage in this space for the benefit of our customers. As an example, this year, we partnered with Emerson and Microsoft to develop a joint hydrogen value chain solution demo that helps optimize CapEx, operating costs and other infrastructure to expedite the speed to market. On that note and turning to slide 8, we\u2019ve outlined several customer wins in Q4 that demonstrate the value we\u2019re creating for our customers through this work as well as the current and future growth opportunities. On this slide, we\u2019ve highlighted a few examples that are relevant to our discussion here today and would encourage you to read those in more detail. Wrapping up my discussion of our fiscal \u201823 results, I can tell you that the team here at AspenTech is energized and excited about the opportunity and growth potential of AspenTech today. At our recent annual sales meeting, I was encouraged to meet with my colleagues from around the world and discuss our next chapter. It was a materially different conversation now that the Heritage AspenTech OSI and SSE teams have all been a part of a unified organization for 13 months. Their excitement about what\u2019s possible going forward was palpable. As we kick off fiscal \u201824, we entered the year with a strong foundation from which we can build and grow new AspenTech. The success we had in fiscal \u201823 putting the teams, systems and processes in place necessary to scale this business means we\u2019re now able to increase our focus on execution and achieving our go-to-market priorities. Now turning to slide 9. I want to shift to fiscal \u201824 and our ACV guidance. We start this year with a solid operational foundation and growing momentum. Customers are reacting well to our expanded value proposition and ability to positively impact their bottom line and sustainability efforts. Moreover, customers across all industries are grappling with their strategies to achieve a successful energy transition and believe we\u2019re positioned extremely well to help them achieve their goals. The technology stack and long-term vision for our solutions are very compelling to customers. Our outlook is for ACV growth of at least 11.5% in fiscal \u201824. This includes at least 7.5 points of growth from Heritage AspenTech, 2.5 points of growth from DGM and 1.5 points of growth from SSE. We believe this outlook effectively balances the positive demand trends we see in most of our end markets and the benefit of improved execution focus with the ongoing uncertainty of the macro environment. Some of the key assumptions underpinning our guidance include: industry demand trends that are consistent with fiscal \u201823, which were positive in all markets, except for chemicals. In the chemicals market, while we remain excited about its long-term prospects due to its focus on digitalization, efficiency improvement and sustainability initiatives, our guidance assumes that market conditions we experienced in the second half of fiscal \u201823 will persist throughout all fiscal \u201824. Within Heritage AspenTech, we expect the ongoing strength in the refining market will support another solid year of MSC growth. The engineering suite is expected to continue benefiting from encouraging CapEx trends across the upstream energy market as well as the positive impact from sustainability initiatives. Finally, for APM, we anticipate its ACV growth contribution to be similar to fiscal \u201823. While we continue to think APM is an attractive growth opportunity, our guidance does not anticipate selling conditions to improve this year. For DGM, we\u2019re confident DGM ACV growth will improve in fiscal \u201824 due to: one, our ongoing investment in DGM sales capacity, including our international sales team; two, increasing demand in the market as funding to upgrade and expand electrical grids continues to grow; and three, the benefit of a full year of DGM customers adopting our term license offering. Turning to SSE. We are pleased with its underlying performance in fiscal \u201823 and the future growth opportunity for this suite. SSE is benefiting from increased investment in traditional upstream CapEx, a growing number of opportunities to support our customer sustainability efforts in areas such as carbon capture sequestration and geothermal energy, among others, as well as the benefits of AspenTech\u2019s tokenization model. Having said that, it is important to note that a significant portion of SSE\u2019s outperformance in fiscal \u201823 was due to the positive impact of a transformation synergy that was a onetime in nature. As customers renewed or signed new agreements that align with Heritage AspenTech\u2019s standard contract terms and conditions. SSE contract duration at the time of the Emerson transaction was approximately one year which means we have renewed almost all of its existing contracts and largely capture the impact of this transformation initiative. There remains an important transformation synergy in the SSE business which is the conversion of a large base of legacy perpetual SMS ACV to term software ACV, which will begin to convert in fiscal \u201824 by leveraging the SSE token suite. We expect this to materialize over a multiyear period. Overall, SSE\u2019s 1.5 points of expected ACV growth contribution equates to a mid-teens SSE ACV growth rate, which compares favorably to our expectations for this business when we announced the Emerson transaction. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Chantelle before I return for closing remarks. Chantelle?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you, Antonio. I will now review our financials for the fourth quarter and for the full year of our fiscal 2023 on slide 10. Before I begin, I\u2019d like to highlight that our earnings presentation includes explanations regarding the impact of ASC Topic 606 on our financial results. We have also included definitions of annual contract value or ACV and bookings in our earnings presentation now available on our IR website. We ask that investors refer to these definitions together with today\u2019s call. As Antonio discussed, annual contract value was $884.9 million at the end of fiscal \u201823, up 11.8% year-over-year and 3.5% quarter-over-quarter. This was at the high end of our outlook for fiscal \u201823, reflecting our portfolio expansion, solid growth across our product suites and resilient demand in most end markets. Customer attrition was 5.9% in fiscal \u201823, beating our guide of 7% to 8%, mainly due to benefits from transformation efforts in SSE and secondarily, focused customer success efforts on EPC customers to mitigate reduction in spend. Annual spend for Heritage AspenTech was approximately $730.9 million at the end of fiscal \u201823, increasing 8.5% year-over-year and 2.7% quarter-over-quarter. Please note that we will not be disclosing annual spend for Heritage AspenTech going forward, now that we have finished the fiscal year. Total bookings was $380 million in the fourth quarter and $1.08 billion in fiscal 2023, above the high end of our guide. As a reminder, bookings are impacted by the timing of renewals. Total revenue was $320.6 million for the fourth quarter and $1.04 billion for fiscal 2023 within our guidance range. As a reminder, revenue in our model is heavily impacted by contract renewal timing and variability under ASC Topic 606. Now turning to profitability. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $6 million, while net income was $27.3 million or $0.42 per share in Q4. For fiscal \u201823, operating loss was $183.1 million and net loss was $107.8 million or $1.67 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $148.9 million in Q4, representing a 46.4% non-GAAP operating margin. For fiscal \u201823, non-GAAP operating income was $394.8 million, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 37.8%. Related to my comment on revenue on Topic 606, the timing of customer renewals and the resulting impact on license revenue recognition in a given quarter also drive fluctuation in margins between periods. Expenses came in slightly higher than our guide due to an increase in bad debt expense driven by one customer. Non-GAAP net income was $138.2 million in the quarter or $2.13 per share. For fiscal \u201823, non-GAAP net income was $372.1 million or $5.72 per share. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended fiscal \u201823 with approximately $241.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and no debt. In addition, we had $193.1 million available -- dollars available on our revolving credit facility. On cash flow, we generated $113.6 million of cash from operations and $111.5 million of free cash flow in Q4. For fiscal \u201823, we generated $299.2 million in operating cash flow and $292.3 million in free cash flow. This was below our expectations due to lower collections. As we have discussed in the past, Heritage AspenTech has a disproportionate amount of its receivables due on June 30th. This year, we saw a greater portion of these invoices pushed out of the quarter as certain customers took longer to pay than they have historically. We received a significant portion of these payments in July. We believe this reflects certain customers being more cautious as they manage through a tighter working capital and cost of capital environment. Tightening our collection processes and improving the rigor of our collections forecast across the entire business is a primary area of focus for us in fiscal 2024. Before turning to guidance, I would like to take a moment to discuss our capital allocation strategy, which we have outlined on slide 11. I\u2019ll begin by providing an update on Micromine. In collaboration with Potentia, Micromine\u2019s majority owner, we have terminated our agreement to acquire Micromine. As stated previously, we have been waiting to secure final regulatory approval. The outstanding approval needed was from the Russian government. As its review process continues, the timing and requirements necessary to secure the approval became increasingly unclear. This lack of clarity on the potential for and timing of a successful regulatory review led us to this course of action. We remain committed to acquisitions, including smaller technology tuck-ins or larger more strategic targets as our primary use of capital. We have built one of the world\u2019s leading industrial software businesses, and we believe we are in a great position to deepen our product portfolios for our core verticals through M&A. In addition, we will opportunistically pursue acquisitions that provide us with leadership positions within new markets that could further benefit from our deep technical capabilities and first principles approach. Importantly, we have strengthened our internal M&A capabilities to execute on additional M&A as part of our strategic road map. I would note as well that despite the decision to terminate the Micromine transaction, the metals and mining industry remains an attractive market, particularly for our DGM, MSC and APM suites, and we remain committed to expanding our footprint in this industry through organic and inorganic investments. If we do not identify attractive and actionable M&A opportunities, we will pursue share repurchase authorizations if market and business conditions warrant. For example, in Q4, we announced a $100 million accelerated share repurchase program that we anticipate completing this quarter. And today, we are announcing that our Board of Directors has approved a $300 million share repurchase authorization for fiscal year \u201824. Once the ASR is complete, our intention is to begin executing on this new authorization. We maintain a robust financial profile with a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. We consider these to be strategic assets, and they allow us to deploy capital in ways that generate value for our customers, employees, the communities we serve and our shareholders. Turning to slide 12. I would like to now close with guidance. Consistent with prior fiscal years, we will continue to provide guidance on an annual basis. As Antonio mentioned, we are targeting total ACV growth of at least 11.5% year-over-year in fiscal \u201824. This includes our expectations for attrition of approximately 5% with a higher concentration of attrition occurring in Q2 and Q3. We expect total bookings of at least $1.04 billion with $580 million up for renewal in fiscal \u201824 and $80 million up for renewal in Q1. We expect total revenue of at least $1.12 billion, GAAP net loss at or better than $7 million and non-GAAP net income of at least $424 million. In addition, we expect GAAP net loss per share at or better than $0.11 and non-GAAP net income per share of at least $6.51. This includes the impact of our fiscal \u201823 share repurchase program. From a cash flow perspective, we expect operating cash flow of at least $378 million and free cash flow of at least $360 million. Please refer to our earnings release and presentation for a complete overview of our fiscal \u201824 guidance. Our earnings presentation presents other important considerations for investors to think about in terms of modeling our business. I\u2019d now like to provide some additional color on these points. In general, our business is typically weighted more towards the second half of the fiscal year. For ACV, we expect fiscal \u201824 growth to have a similar cadence to what we delivered in fiscal \u201823 -- in fiscal \u201824 to \u201823 in terms of our net new ACV added during the year. Q1 is expected to be the lowest and Q4, the highest in terms of net new ACV added. On free cash flow, the large majority of our free cash flow typically occurs in the second half of the year. In fiscal \u201824, we expect at least 80% of free cash flow to occur in the second half of the year which is largely consistent with last year\u2019s linearity. We anticipate free cash flow in the second half to be fairly evenly split between Q3 and Q4. Please note that Q1 is typically our lowest free cash flow quarter and we expect that to be true again this year. Our guidance assumes cash tax payments of approximately $125 million. With respect to revenue, as noted earlier, timing is more variable due to the impact of 606. However, renewals, which heavily impact license revenue are generally more weighted to the second half of the year, with Q1 renewals at the lowest and Q4 renewals at the highest. Based on current expectations, we anticipate that our revenue linearity will be broadly similar to fiscal 2023. We will continue to disclose the amount of bookings up for renewal each quarter. Let me wrap up by saying that we are proud of what we have accomplished in fiscal 2023. I am confident in our team and our ability to capitalize on both existing and emerging growth opportunities going forward. With that, I will turn it back to Antonio for his closing remarks. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Great. Thanks, Chantelle. We\u2019ll be opening up the call for Q&A momentarily. But before we do that, I want to reiterate the key takeaways from this call and fiscal \u201823 more broadly. First, we delivered a solid year in fiscal \u201823, delivering double-digit ACV growth and laying the foundation for the expansion of ACV growth and free cash flow margins in the coming years. Second, we made great progress integrating OSI and SSE with Heritage AspenTech and made a strong progress on our ambitious transformation road maps for both the OSI and SSE businesses. I\u2019m confident our efforts this year position us for success in fiscal \u201824 and beyond. Third, sustainability is a sizable and growing tailwind across every area of our business. We are in a great position to capitalize on increased investment from customers in areas like energy transition and electrification for years to come. As we look ahead, we expect to build on our leadership in sustainability as a key driver of our strategic priorities. And finally, we entered fiscal \u201824 with solid momentum, a cutting-edge technology stack and long-term vision for our solution that is very compelling to our customers. A big component of my confidence in our ability to deliver on these outcomes is also the incredibly talented team we have at the helm of new AspenTech today. We entered the year with the right people, processes and products in place to take full advantage of the opportunity in front of us. With that, operator, we would now like to begin the Q&A, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rob Oliver from Baird.\nRob Oliver: Thank you guys for taking my question. I appreciate it. I had two. One, just to start since it\u2019ll probably be the last time we\u2019re going to be able to ask about it, which is the Heritage AspenTech component of the guide, which I\u2019m going to miss. Antonio, I appreciated your color around some of the moving parts within that, and it looks like it\u2019s relatively flattish with this year. Can you just give us a sense of what linearity was in Q4 with your chemicals customers? And I know things dropped off pretty dramatically there. So when you say, \"Hey, we\u2019re not expecting any change in the market.\" Is that off of sort of that low base you guys saw last quarter? Help us understand that and maybe some of the other moving parts within that. And I just had a quick follow-up.\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I mean, look, the fourth quarter was a solid quarter for HAT growth. That supported the eventual outcome that we got. Nonetheless, as you said, the growth for HAT in fiscal \u201823 was similar to fiscal \u201822, around 8.5%. And that is a result of a combination of factors, certainly chemicals. Now that chemicals completely disappeared, but probably from a growth standpoint, it contributed less than half of what it normally does. There was a little bit of back and forth throughout the year in our Russian business. And we had a quarter where China was fully closed down as well. And look, ultimately, fiscal \u201823 was an incredible year. A huge amount of work was accomplished in integration and transformation. They had a leadership team had to take on the integration and transformation of the OSI and SSE businesses. And I have no doubt that a lot of their brain cycles were dedicated to that effort as opposed to the normal execution cadence that we have in the company. Now that we\u2019re past that, I am convinced that we\u2019re going to get back to that execution cadence going forward which is what encourages me about our guidance for fiscal \u201824 in line with what we accomplished in fiscal \u201823, at least what we did in fiscal \u201823.\nRob Oliver: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you, Antonio. I appreciate it. And then, Chantelle, just to quickly touch on some of the issues around the acquired assets at the SSE and DGM that surfaced last quarter. It sounds like you guys are on the path to fixing those and I guess, particularly on SSE around contract durations and DGM around labor-related issues. Can you just help us understand where we are relative to those as we enter FY24?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes, happy to, Rob. I would say we\u2019re exiting FY23 with confidence that we fully understand the learnings and have incorporated those. So, we\u2019ve taken the exit out of \u201823, incorporate that into our \u201824 guide, learning from SSE, learning from DGM and OSI. So Rob, we\u2019ve fully taken those learnings and incorporated them and we\u2019re confident that we have our hands around those in our \u201824 guidance.\nAntonio Pietri: What I would also add to Chantelle\u2019s answer, Rob, is, look, we\u2019re now entering \u201824 with the leadership team, the organization, the systems and the processes in place. That\u2019s what we worked in \u201823. \u201824 is about execution now, and that\u2019s what gives us a lot of confidence.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin: Just historically, you guys sort of provided your guidance within 3 percentage points. So, this 11.5%, am I correct to assume that that\u2019s sort of the low end of the guide? I just want to make sure, right, versus the midpoint of the guide, the way you would historically guide, right? Does that make sense, what I\u2019m asking?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. You should assume that the 11.5% is the floor for our performance in fiscal \u201823 -- fiscal \u201824. Sorry.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. That sounds good to me. And then on DGM, just we\u2019ve heard from some of your competitors that utilities just generally as you transition the license structure, they have to figure out how to incorporate it into their base rate. Can you just talk about it? And it seems it\u2019s not right, it\u2019s not just an Aspen issue. It\u2019s like other competitors have sort of highlighted that as well. Can you just talk to us where we are in terms of sort of industry acceptance as you go away from perpetual license model, was utilities -- regulated utilities customers. Just give us a little bit more color how much work has been done, what\u2019s the understanding level in the industry? It sounds like you guys have done some, but just maybe a little bit more color. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, Andrew, I believe one of the comments that we have on our prepared remarks is also how pleasantly surprised we are about the early receptivity to our term licensing model by utility customers. Frankly, we had that same belief that you just communicated at the beginning of the fiscal year and listening to the OSI team. But as we approach these customers with term licensing, the benefits of it and even some preliminary conversations around the token suite, we\u2019ve seen them to be very accommodated. No doubt that they have to find ways to build that cost into their cost rate. They do go through those motions. A lot of them do. It has allowed us to do some term business or new pipeline that has closed early on. But also, we\u2019ve been able to convert on pipeline that is being on a perpetual license basis, to term license business at the very end of those deal negotiations. So, yes, we understood that to be the case, but the fact is that our sales motion is proven to be otherwise in most cases. No doubt, there are some customers that prefer perpetual, but this is a transition and the progress we\u2019ve made, we\u2019re very pleased with.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matthew Pfau from William Blair.\nMatthew Pfau: First, I wanted to you ask on acquisitions, and thanks for an update on the capital allocation strategy. But specifically on acquisitions, what does the pipeline look like there for larger transactions like the Micromine one, are there attractive ones that are out there? And how soon would you be willing or feel that you\u2019re ready to pursue another transaction, similar size to Micromine?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. I think that I can start, Matthew. I think from the perspective, we definitely have a pipeline. We have an active pipeline that we\u2019re always looking at as being part of our capital allocation strategy. There are targets out there that are of interest. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t always time when you would like to do it versus when they\u2019re available. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re ready to do that activity when it presents itself. We\u2019ve developed the internal M&A activities. We have the balance sheet to support it. So, I think we\u2019re ready when we find it, but we remain disciplined as we\u2019ve always discussed in the sense that we want to make sure it is accretive for support double-digit ACV growth at our best-in-class profitability. So, we\u2019ll time it when it\u2019s available, but we\u2019re ready to still engage in it.\nMatthew Pfau: Okay. Great. And then just wanted to follow up on comments around the Russia business. Is there any of that lap that is included in the fiscal \u201824 guidance? And is there any risk around that part of the business?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, our guidance of 11.5% certainly accounts for chemicals, accounts for other potential eventualities. But on Russia, due to the different challenges that we\u2019ve been facing in that market, we decided to go to a renewals-only model. So that means that we\u2019re not going to be selling anything new into Russia going forward. We will be focusing on renewing the existing business, and that\u2019s going to be our focus. So our guidance already implies that we will not see any growth from Russia. And we\u2019ve also taken a little bit of a conservative approach with respect to potential attrition in Russia although we expect to renew the business that\u2019s coming to us in fiscal \u201824, we\u2019ve been cautious and assume some level of attrition in Russia as we try to renew some of that business. So, going forward, AspenTech will only be renewing business. We will not be selling new entitlement to Russian customers.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJason Celino: Thanks for fitting me in. No, really, really strong guide here with a double-digit ACV guidance. I think you mentioned on Andrew\u2019s prior question that this was kind of the floor. I guess, how conservative do you think investors should view this type of ACV outlook?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, look, it\u2019s -- if we give you that guidance of 11.5% being the floor is because we\u2019re confident about that number. If you look at the ACV growth in fiscal \u201823 and the attrition 11.8% plus 5.9%, that\u2019s about 17.7% of gross growth, new growth in fiscal \u201823 at a very strong outcome from a new growth, new business generated in fiscal \u201823. In fiscal \u201824, if you look at the guidance of at least 11.5% and the attrition at 5%, approximately 5%, that 16.5%. So, what you see in our guidance is the expectation of chemicals for the full year not contributing. We had half a year of strong contribution from chemicals in fiscal \u201823. We\u2019re assuming that chemicals will be subdued in the full year in fiscal \u201824 in there less Russia growth or no Russia growth and so that\u2019s how we come out to the 11.5%. If you look at our guidance as well on the suite -- on a per suite basis, you look at -- HAT delivered about 8.5% growth in fiscal \u201823. We\u2019re taking approximately close to double-digit growth in fiscal \u201824. OSI grew 30% in fiscal \u201823, we\u2019re guiding to almost 40% growth for the DGM suite -- sorry, I should have said DGM in fiscal \u201823, 30%, 40% in fiscal \u201824. And SSE grew by 33% in fiscal \u201823, and we\u2019re guiding to about 14%, 15% growth in fiscal \u201824. And this is solid growth across all suites because we\u2019re assuming -- we saw in Q4 a solid contribution to growth from DGM. We were conservative in our Q3 outlook for DGM considering that we were still learning around the dynamics of customers\u2019 motions to sign deals, but we\u2019re pleasantly surprised in Q4 with that outcome. So overall, look, we feel good about the trajectory for HAT in fiscal \u201824, the trajectory for DGM, the trajectory for SSE. We\u2019re going to have a greater focus on our execution and now it\u2019s about really injecting more momentum into the business as we go forward.\nJason Celino: And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Chantelle on the free cash flow for the year and for next year -- for the quarter. You mentioned some timing differences just on invoicing. That makes sense. Any way to quantify what moved from Q4 to Q1?\nChantelle Breithaupt: No, I understand the question for sure, Jason. I would put it at basically the difference between the actual and the guide would be the range that I would carry in. And then in our guidance, assume that some of that continues through the year. So [Technical Difficulty] Q4 has done. But you can say the range to the actual would be what I would assume.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler.\nClarke Jeffries: I really appreciate the disclosure on ACV growth contributions, especially by industry. Antonio, maybe I would clarify something that you briefly mentioned in the prior question. But -- when we think about Heritage AspenTech getting back to double digits, where would be the delta there? Was it chemicals was half the contribution that you normally expect? Any other call-outs when we think about industry contribution overall Heritage returning to that double-digit level?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. No, look, I think fundamentally, our energy industry, refining, it\u2019s been a strong contributor. Certainly, that will be the case. Engineering accelerated to almost 8.6% growth in fiscal \u201823. By the way, that\u2019s the fastest growth rate of our engineering business since fiscal \u201814 when we grew just over 10%. So, we\u2019re really excited about the tailwinds for the engineering business from sustainability investments. I think that will continue in fiscal \u201824. We believe that MSC will continue to perform strongly. There are some products in MSC that the performance we expected as a result of execution focus in fiscal \u201823, that focus will come back. I think that will give us a lift in the same markets, refining even upstream that is taking out some of -- more of those technologies. And APM sort of similar contribution. So -- but look, I think MSC will be about focus on execution in fiscal \u201824.\nClarke Jeffries: Perfect. And then a follow-up for Chantelle. One thing that stands out to me is the bookings number for next year. Just wondering if there were any early renewals, anything that contributed to bookings this year being above the high end of the guide that you had for last quarter for full year bookings? Any other mechanics that would lead to the bookings number being down year-over-year for fiscal \u201824?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. I think that in the sense of some of the prepared remarks you\u2019ve heard driving the bookings for this year would be the achievement of the term length for HAT, I think that we look at what we\u2019ve achieved in DGM. So, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything mechanical. I think it\u2019s just the mix of business and timing of the renewals is the key factor. So, I would put around more of the timing of the renewals than anything more specific than that.\nAntonio Pietri: And just one more thing and for everyone, if you look at the presentation, the slide deck that we posted, if you look at slide 16, it has all the ACV dollars by suite over the last three years, which will allow you to calculate the growth rate for fiscal \u201823 instead of having to remember what I said.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Josh Tilton from Wolfe Research.\nJosh Tilton: The first question that I wanted to ask is kind of revisiting the question that I think was sort of asked about a few questions ago. But given this is the last time we\u2019re -- you\u2019re going to, I guess, talk to or disclose the Heritage business, you\u2019re guiding to kind of like a mid-single-digit growth for next year. When you guys step back and you just really look at that business, like how should investors view the growth profile of what is core Heritage Aspen over the next three years? Like does this remain a mid-single-digit grower? Is this going to accelerate, decelerate? Like how do you guys think about the growth profile of this business over the next few years?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, let me -- look -- first of all, we\u2019re guiding to 7.5%. And I guess that would be at the high end of mid-single-digits. But look, we -- for us to get to our growth rate that we believe this business can operate at, the HAT business will be a double-digit growth business. That\u2019s our expectation. We are revisiting our expectations around the engineering business from being sort of a high mid-single-digit business to high single to double digits. I think our MSC business hit a soft spot, if you will, this year. That will recover. And we continue to have expectations about the NIM suite. This is why we made that tuck-in acquisition that we just announced. So overall, our expectation is for HAT to be a double-digit grower. Now, what I would tell you is this is on an ACV basis in the past has been an annual spend. So, there\u2019s a little bit of a step-down because of the higher base in ACV, but overall, our expectations haven\u2019t changed for that suite, okay?\nJosh Tilton: Makes sense. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for me is, I think you guys, during the Q&A, said that you look at to the current guidance is sort of a floor. If we were to look at the heritage business or some of these newer assets from Emerson, like 12 months from now, you guys beat the guide, where would we expect -- where are you most confident to see the upside come from? Is it from the Heritage business or some of these newer assets?\nAntonio Pietri: I mean, look, I think chemicals plays a big role in the outcome for HAT. Listen to the commentary from chemicals company CEOs, they expect chemicals to be subdued through the end of this calendar year. They are not saying anything about next year, but we assume it\u2019s more of the same, to be conservative on our guide. If this change, I could provide some upside. I\u2019m a big believer in our MSC business. We were fully focused on executing on that business. Our engineering business shown strong resilience. But look, I think DGM, we\u2019re gaining momentum on that business as well. I look at sustainability, could be the big surprise as well here and the big benefit on sustainability is coming through the HAT suite. Electrification is what drives DGM and we\u2019re building the pipeline there. So, I know I\u2019m sort of giving you an answer for everything, but I just think that there\u2019s just a lot of opportunity out there, and it will be just a matter of execution. So, we\u2019ll see what outperforms, but 11.5% is a floor.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Mark Schappel from Loop Capital Markets.\nMark Schappel: Antonio, this quarter\u2019s remarks around the DGM business were much more positive than last quarter when you ran into some project milestone issues and had some longer sales cycles that you spoke of. I was wondering if you could just review once again some of the changes in that business over the last quarter that you\u2019re seeing?\nAntonio Pietri: Look, I think we need to talk about the cadence of the full fiscal year. There was an incredible amount of work going on in Q1 and Q2 to lay the foundation, put in place the teams, the processes, the systems, are pushed into the market of SSE and DGM with term software -- or term licensing for the software. As we got into the services business, there are some things that we found there. And in a way, a lot of things came to ahead in Q3. We learned a lot out of the Q3 quarter. And I would also argue that those learnings were quickly applied early in Q4 and it was produced, what I think was much cleaner execution in Q4. There was very little learning that happened in Q4. It was more about applying what we learned from the previous three quarters. And then, I think that we are -- we generated a momentum, which is what\u2019s propelling us into fiscal 2024. So, I think it\u2019s just how the year flowed and the activities that were happening and the assumptions we made sort of all came together in the Q3 quarter, but we quickly pivoted. And I\u2019m very proud about the job that the team did coming out of that quarter to really refocus our execution, and therefore, you have what I think is a tremendous Q4 outcome.\nMark Schappel: And then, as a follow-up, with respect to Micromine and the termination of that deal, to be relevant in the metals and mining industry, do you believe that you need to do another transaction in that sector?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, look, I\u2019ve always said that if we want to sort of grow and be relevant in a new industry, we need to have an anchor asset, meaning buy something that gives us already critical mass. And therefore, the answer is yes. I still believe that in any industry that we decide to go into, the goal has to be to buy an anchor tenant, if you will.\nOperator: And thank you. And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Antonio Pietri, CEO, for closing remarks.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. Again, just to reiterate the takeaways. Look, we built the foundation for the next stage of growth for the company. And I hope that\u2019s clear. We\u2019re entering fiscal \u201824 with momentum, and we believe that the guidance that we provided supports that. We continue to see strong demand around our mission-critical solutions, HAT, DGM and SSE. And we see emerging opportunities in sustainability, especially for our engineering business. So, all of this, we believe, is creating a very exciting outlook and environment for the new AspenTech. And well, our job is now to execute in fiscal \u201824. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chantelle Breithaupt",
            "content": "Thank you, Antonio. I will now review our financials for the fourth quarter and for the full year of our fiscal 2023 on slide 10. Before I begin, I'd like to highlight that our earnings presentation includes explanations regarding the impact of ASC Topic 606 on our financial results. We have also included definitions of annual contract value or ACV and bookings in our earnings presentation now available on our IR website. We ask that investors refer to these definitions together with today's call. As Antonio discussed, annual contract value was $884.9 million at the end of fiscal \u201823, up 11.8% year-over-year and 3.5% quarter-over-quarter. This was at the high end of our outlook for fiscal \u201823, reflecting our portfolio expansion, solid growth across our product suites and resilient demand in most end markets. Customer attrition was 5.9% in fiscal \u201823, beating our guide of 7% to 8%, mainly due to benefits from transformation efforts in SSE and secondarily, focused customer success efforts on EPC customers to mitigate reduction in spend. Annual spend for Heritage AspenTech was approximately $730.9 million at the end of fiscal \u201823, increasing 8.5% year-over-year and 2.7% quarter-over-quarter. Please note that we will not be disclosing annual spend for Heritage AspenTech going forward, now that we have finished the fiscal year. Total bookings was $380 million in the fourth quarter and $1.08 billion in fiscal 2023, above the high end of our guide. As a reminder, bookings are impacted by the timing of renewals. Total revenue was $320.6 million for the fourth quarter and $1.04 billion for fiscal 2023 within our guidance range. As a reminder, revenue in our model is heavily impacted by contract renewal timing and variability under ASC Topic 606. Now turning to profitability. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $6 million, while net income was $27.3 million or $0.42 per share in Q4. For fiscal \u201823, operating loss was $183.1 million and net loss was $107.8 million or $1.67 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income was $148.9 million in Q4, representing a 46.4% non-GAAP operating margin. For fiscal \u201823, non-GAAP operating income was $394.8 million, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 37.8%. Related to my comment on revenue on Topic 606, the timing of customer renewals and the resulting impact on license revenue recognition in a given quarter also drive fluctuation in margins between periods. Expenses came in slightly higher than our guide due to an increase in bad debt expense driven by one customer. Non-GAAP net income was $138.2 million in the quarter or $2.13 per share. For fiscal \u201823, non-GAAP net income was $372.1 million or $5.72 per share. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended fiscal \u201823 with approximately $241.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and no debt. In addition, we had $193.1 million available -- dollars available on our revolving credit facility. On cash flow, we generated $113.6 million of cash from operations and $111.5 million of free cash flow in Q4. For fiscal \u201823, we generated $299.2 million in operating cash flow and $292.3 million in free cash flow. This was below our expectations due to lower collections. As we have discussed in the past, Heritage AspenTech has a disproportionate amount of its receivables due on June 30th. This year, we saw a greater portion of these invoices pushed out of the quarter as certain customers took longer to pay than they have historically. We received a significant portion of these payments in July. We believe this reflects certain customers being more cautious as they manage through a tighter working capital and cost of capital environment. Tightening our collection processes and improving the rigor of our collections forecast across the entire business is a primary area of focus for us in fiscal 2024. Before turning to guidance, I would like to take a moment to discuss our capital allocation strategy, which we have outlined on slide 11. I'll begin by providing an update on Micromine. In collaboration with Potentia, Micromine's majority owner, we have terminated our agreement to acquire Micromine. As stated previously, we have been waiting to secure final regulatory approval. The outstanding approval needed was from the Russian government. As its review process continues, the timing and requirements necessary to secure the approval became increasingly unclear. This lack of clarity on the potential for and timing of a successful regulatory review led us to this course of action. We remain committed to acquisitions, including smaller technology tuck-ins or larger more strategic targets as our primary use of capital. We have built one of the world's leading industrial software businesses, and we believe we are in a great position to deepen our product portfolios for our core verticals through M&A. In addition, we will opportunistically pursue acquisitions that provide us with leadership positions within new markets that could further benefit from our deep technical capabilities and first principles approach. Importantly, we have strengthened our internal M&A capabilities to execute on additional M&A as part of our strategic road map. I would note as well that despite the decision to terminate the Micromine transaction, the metals and mining industry remains an attractive market, particularly for our DGM, MSC and APM suites, and we remain committed to expanding our footprint in this industry through organic and inorganic investments. If we do not identify attractive and actionable M&A opportunities, we will pursue share repurchase authorizations if market and business conditions warrant. For example, in Q4, we announced a $100 million accelerated share repurchase program that we anticipate completing this quarter. And today, we are announcing that our Board of Directors has approved a $300 million share repurchase authorization for fiscal year \u201824. Once the ASR is complete, our intention is to begin executing on this new authorization. We maintain a robust financial profile with a strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows. We consider these to be strategic assets, and they allow us to deploy capital in ways that generate value for our customers, employees, the communities we serve and our shareholders. Turning to slide 12. I would like to now close with guidance. Consistent with prior fiscal years, we will continue to provide guidance on an annual basis. As Antonio mentioned, we are targeting total ACV growth of at least 11.5% year-over-year in fiscal \u201824. This includes our expectations for attrition of approximately 5% with a higher concentration of attrition occurring in Q2 and Q3. We expect total bookings of at least $1.04 billion with $580 million up for renewal in fiscal \u201824 and $80 million up for renewal in Q1. We expect total revenue of at least $1.12 billion, GAAP net loss at or better than $7 million and non-GAAP net income of at least $424 million. In addition, we expect GAAP net loss per share at or better than $0.11 and non-GAAP net income per share of at least $6.51. This includes the impact of our fiscal \u201823 share repurchase program. From a cash flow perspective, we expect operating cash flow of at least $378 million and free cash flow of at least $360 million. Please refer to our earnings release and presentation for a complete overview of our fiscal \u201824 guidance. Our earnings presentation presents other important considerations for investors to think about in terms of modeling our business. I'd now like to provide some additional color on these points. In general, our business is typically weighted more towards the second half of the fiscal year. For ACV, we expect fiscal \u201824 growth to have a similar cadence to what we delivered in fiscal \u201823 -- in fiscal \u201824 to \u201823 in terms of our net new ACV added during the year. Q1 is expected to be the lowest and Q4, the highest in terms of net new ACV added. On free cash flow, the large majority of our free cash flow typically occurs in the second half of the year. In fiscal \u201824, we expect at least 80% of free cash flow to occur in the second half of the year which is largely consistent with last year's linearity. We anticipate free cash flow in the second half to be fairly evenly split between Q3 and Q4. Please note that Q1 is typically our lowest free cash flow quarter and we expect that to be true again this year. Our guidance assumes cash tax payments of approximately $125 million. With respect to revenue, as noted earlier, timing is more variable due to the impact of 606. However, renewals, which heavily impact license revenue are generally more weighted to the second half of the year, with Q1 renewals at the lowest and Q4 renewals at the highest. Based on current expectations, we anticipate that our revenue linearity will be broadly similar to fiscal 2023. We will continue to disclose the amount of bookings up for renewal each quarter. Let me wrap up by saying that we are proud of what we have accomplished in fiscal 2023. I am confident in our team and our ability to capitalize on both existing and emerging growth opportunities going forward. With that, I will turn it back to Antonio for his closing remarks. Antonio? Yes, happy to, Rob. I would say we're exiting FY23 with confidence that we fully understand the learnings and have incorporated those. So, we've taken the exit out of \u201823, incorporate that into our \u201824 guide, learning from SSE, learning from DGM and OSI. So Rob, we've fully taken those learnings and incorporated them and we're confident that we have our hands around those in our \u201824 guidance. Yes. I think that I can start, Matthew. I think from the perspective, we definitely have a pipeline. We have an active pipeline that we're always looking at as being part of our capital allocation strategy. There are targets out there that are of interest. Unfortunately, you can't always time when you would like to do it versus when they're available. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're ready to do that activity when it presents itself. We've developed the internal M&A activities. We have the balance sheet to support it. So, I think we're ready when we find it, but we remain disciplined as we've always discussed in the sense that we want to make sure it is accretive for support double-digit ACV growth at our best-in-class profitability. So, we'll time it when it's available, but we're ready to still engage in it. No, I understand the question for sure, Jason. I would put it at basically the difference between the actual and the guide would be the range that I would carry in. And then in our guidance, assume that some of that continues through the year. So [Technical Difficulty] Q4 has done. But you can say the range to the actual would be what I would assume. Yes. I think that in the sense of some of the prepared remarks you've heard driving the bookings for this year would be the achievement of the term length for HAT, I think that we look at what we've achieved in DGM. So, I don't think there's anything mechanical. I think it's just the mix of business and timing of the renewals is the key factor. So, I would put around more of the timing of the renewals than anything more specific than that."

            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Let me open by thanking our investors for their thoughtful feedback and suggestions regarding our earnings materials, which are reflected in the structure of today's prepared remarks as well as our updated earnings presentation. Beginning on slide 3. We achieved several important milestones in the quarter and fiscal year to help lay the foundation for AspenTech to enter our next growth stage as a leading global industrial software player. First, we delivered a solid fourth quarter to close out a successful year, marked by resilient demand and ACV growth above the midpoint of our guidance range. We believe these results have successfully laid the groundwork for a promising fiscal \u201824 and position AspenTech well for future ACV growth and free cash flow margin expansion over time. Second, we made substantial progress integrating and transforming OSI and SSE, and we're pleased with how well this business has fit into our product portfolio, given how early we are in our journey with these assets. We're excited about the enhanced value proposition our solutions can now provide customers across energy, chemicals, EPCs and utilities, among other industries. Third, we built the teams, processes and systems to capture growth synergies between Emerson and AspenTech and establish a cadence between organizations to execute on these opportunities going forward. And finally, we remain focused on R&D and co-innovation with the strategic partners and customers. Our efforts to advance use cases in support of our customer sustainability strategies show incredible promise and have been well received by customers. Q4 was a strong finish to an important year and show the benefits of our transformation efforts and learnings. Fiscal \u201823 annual contract value was $884.9 million, representing double-digit growth of 11.8% year-over-year. While fiscal \u201823 free cash flow was $292.3 million. Chantelle will address our free cash flow performance in her remarks. Turning to slide 4. I'll walk through our suite performance. In the quarter and throughout the year, demand in most of our end markets and geographies was strong. Our performance this year against the backdrop of an unpredictable macro environment is an important reminder of the mission criticality of AspenTech solutions to our customers' operations and strategic priorities. I'll touch now on the key high-level themes we're seeing across our suites. First, Heritage AspenTech performed well, contributing 7.2 points of growth on an ACV basis. Our engineering suite outperformed this year, driven by an improving business environment for EPC customers after years of restructuring in the industry and a strong energy market. We also saw material growth contribution from new customers that are benefiting from or investing in sustainability-related projects. We believe these new customers represent a classic land-and-expand opportunity for our other suites in the future. MSC performance was in line with our commentary from the third quarter, benefiting from refining market strength. Chemical demand remained subdued in the fourth quarter, particularly for bulk chemical producers as companies continue working through destoking and the impact from an uncertain economic outlook. This dynamic is having a more pronounced impact on OpEx spend for chemicals customers which drives most of our chemicals business. Our expectation is this trend will now last at least through the end of the calendar year based on recent market commentary from customers. APM's performance came in at the lower end of our guidance range for fiscal \u201823 and reflected a continuation of the trend we have experienced in recent years. While APM represents a relatively small portion of our overall business, we continue to believe in its growth potential and remain committed to building out its capabilities to better capitalize on opportunities in certain markets. On that note, I'm pleased to announce that we recently closed a tuck-in IP acquisition that will provide additional failure mode and effects analysis and new root cause analysis capabilities, in short, FMEA and RCA capabilities to our Mtell product. This will strengthen Mtell's existing use cases and help to further expand its reach into other industries such as power and transmission and distribution. The SSE and DGM suite of products were both successful in their first year as part of new AspenTech, exceeding our anticipated point of ACV growth contribution by 60 basis points in total. SSE had an exceptional fiscal \u201823 and was the largest area of outperformance for the year. The offset was driven in large part by the positive impact of initial transformation synergies, including the establishment of minimum contract lengths and Heritage AspenTech-like contract terms and conditions as well as better-than-expected demand. SSE's performance this year reinforces the attractiveness of our full life cycle solution that supports both, traditional oil and gas E&P for upstream customers as well as an increasing number of sustainability use cases. DGM sales delivered a solid Q4 performance and we are pleased with its sales activity outside of North America. Historically, DGM has been focused on the U.S. and its ability to leverage AspenTech's global expertise and capabilities is an important driver of our growth strategy in fiscal \u201824 and beyond. Furthermore, the imperative to expand the grid to achieve global electrification and the funds committed globally by governments to this effort will accelerate the demand environment for the DGM suite. Turning now to slide 5. In fiscal \u201823, we built the foundation of new AspenTech while delivering solid financial results. In the span of 13 months, we made significant progress bringing OSI, SSE and Heritage AspenTech together. We successfully integrated this business's sales, marketing, finance and product development teams, among other areas to create a fully unified organization. We also completed our acquisition of inmation, which, combined with our industrial IoT offerings, forms what we now refer to as DataWorks. On the synergies front, our results reflect early success in realizing our objectives as part of the Emerson transaction. We are on track to achieve the $110 million of EBITDA synergies which includes $40 million in cost synergies. In particular, we have made significant progress in laying the foundation for our joint go-to-market strategies with Emerson. We're excited about the increasing opportunities we see to jointly expand business in either AspenTech or Emerson accounts as well as co-innovation and OEM [ph] collaboration. Emerson brings a unique and complementary skill set to our industrial software focus, and we're aligned on execution and priorities going forward. Importantly, we also executed the planned transformation work for fiscal \u201823 related to OSI and SSE. Having done all of this and because of it, we remain confident in our execution plan and the time line to achieve the anticipated outcomes from these business's transformation. As an example, in the case of OSI, we're building out OSI's third-party implementation services providers' network to support a secular increase in demand and as part of the business model evolution towards a software-centric business like Heritage AspenTech. We're also receiving encouraging early receptivity to our DGM term license model from utility customers as we introduced an alternative to perpetual software licensing. And we have completed the work to make the DGM suite token-ready to introduce to the market soon. As we discuss on slide 6, we continue to see the mega trends of the energy transition and global electrification as important drivers of our business, particularly related to sustainability projects. That said, I'd like to take a moment now to discuss how we're positioned to capitalize on the sustainability pathway opportunities, many of which have been expanded through our transaction with Emerson. First, Heritage AspenTech's capabilities across all three suites are uniquely positioned to drive energy efficiencies and profitability in our customers' existing asset operations. While also addressing a growing number of energy transition use cases around biofuels production, carbon capture and sequestration, the hydrogen supply chain, electrical batteries, engineering design and recycling process design, direct air carbon capture systems and more. In fiscal \u201823, we already started to see material benefits from sustainability efforts in our engineering suite. In DGM, many customers are using our Monarch SCADA platform to help manage oil and gas distribution systems, supply and demand management for solar, wind and hydropower electricity, and a broad array of key resources, supply and demand management networks such as [indiscernible]. Chemicals and refining customers are also showing heightened interest in micro grid management capabilities, presenting us with the opportunity to cross-sell our DGM suite into these markets. Meanwhile, in SSE, we are seeing interest in geothermal energy production, carbon capture sequestration, subsurface, hydrogen storage and other sustainability use cases that are happening faster than we originally anticipated in certain parts of the world. Now, more than ever, AspenTech is well positioned to drive existing customer growth, win new logos and gain market share through the sustainability-related opportunities. As you can see on slide 7, we're investing in R&D and co-innovation partnership to build out additional sustainability capabilities in our products to enhance our first-mover advantage in this space for the benefit of our customers. As an example, this year, we partnered with Emerson and Microsoft to develop a joint hydrogen value chain solution demo that helps optimize CapEx, operating costs and other infrastructure to expedite the speed to market. On that note and turning to slide 8, we've outlined several customer wins in Q4 that demonstrate the value we're creating for our customers through this work as well as the current and future growth opportunities. On this slide, we've highlighted a few examples that are relevant to our discussion here today and would encourage you to read those in more detail. Wrapping up my discussion of our fiscal \u201823 results, I can tell you that the team here at AspenTech is energized and excited about the opportunity and growth potential of AspenTech today. At our recent annual sales meeting, I was encouraged to meet with my colleagues from around the world and discuss our next chapter. It was a materially different conversation now that the Heritage AspenTech OSI and SSE teams have all been a part of a unified organization for 13 months. Their excitement about what's possible going forward was palpable. As we kick off fiscal \u201824, we entered the year with a strong foundation from which we can build and grow new AspenTech. The success we had in fiscal \u201823 putting the teams, systems and processes in place necessary to scale this business means we're now able to increase our focus on execution and achieving our go-to-market priorities. Now turning to slide 9. I want to shift to fiscal \u201824 and our ACV guidance. We start this year with a solid operational foundation and growing momentum. Customers are reacting well to our expanded value proposition and ability to positively impact their bottom line and sustainability efforts. Moreover, customers across all industries are grappling with their strategies to achieve a successful energy transition and believe we're positioned extremely well to help them achieve their goals. The technology stack and long-term vision for our solutions are very compelling to customers. Our outlook is for ACV growth of at least 11.5% in fiscal \u201824. This includes at least 7.5 points of growth from Heritage AspenTech, 2.5 points of growth from DGM and 1.5 points of growth from SSE. We believe this outlook effectively balances the positive demand trends we see in most of our end markets and the benefit of improved execution focus with the ongoing uncertainty of the macro environment. Some of the key assumptions underpinning our guidance include: industry demand trends that are consistent with fiscal \u201823, which were positive in all markets, except for chemicals. In the chemicals market, while we remain excited about its long-term prospects due to its focus on digitalization, efficiency improvement and sustainability initiatives, our guidance assumes that market conditions we experienced in the second half of fiscal \u201823 will persist throughout all fiscal \u201824. Within Heritage AspenTech, we expect the ongoing strength in the refining market will support another solid year of MSC growth. The engineering suite is expected to continue benefiting from encouraging CapEx trends across the upstream energy market as well as the positive impact from sustainability initiatives. Finally, for APM, we anticipate its ACV growth contribution to be similar to fiscal \u201823. While we continue to think APM is an attractive growth opportunity, our guidance does not anticipate selling conditions to improve this year. For DGM, we're confident DGM ACV growth will improve in fiscal \u201824 due to: one, our ongoing investment in DGM sales capacity, including our international sales team; two, increasing demand in the market as funding to upgrade and expand electrical grids continues to grow; and three, the benefit of a full year of DGM customers adopting our term license offering. Turning to SSE. We are pleased with its underlying performance in fiscal \u201823 and the future growth opportunity for this suite. SSE is benefiting from increased investment in traditional upstream CapEx, a growing number of opportunities to support our customer sustainability efforts in areas such as carbon capture sequestration and geothermal energy, among others, as well as the benefits of AspenTech's tokenization model. Having said that, it is important to note that a significant portion of SSE's outperformance in fiscal \u201823 was due to the positive impact of a transformation synergy that was a onetime in nature. As customers renewed or signed new agreements that align with Heritage AspenTech's standard contract terms and conditions. SSE contract duration at the time of the Emerson transaction was approximately one year which means we have renewed almost all of its existing contracts and largely capture the impact of this transformation initiative. There remains an important transformation synergy in the SSE business which is the conversion of a large base of legacy perpetual SMS ACV to term software ACV, which will begin to convert in fiscal \u201824 by leveraging the SSE token suite. We expect this to materialize over a multiyear period. Overall, SSE's 1.5 points of expected ACV growth contribution equates to a mid-teens SSE ACV growth rate, which compares favorably to our expectations for this business when we announced the Emerson transaction. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Chantelle before I return for closing remarks. Chantelle? Great. Thanks, Chantelle. We'll be opening up the call for Q&A momentarily. But before we do that, I want to reiterate the key takeaways from this call and fiscal \u201823 more broadly. First, we delivered a solid year in fiscal \u201823, delivering double-digit ACV growth and laying the foundation for the expansion of ACV growth and free cash flow margins in the coming years. Second, we made great progress integrating OSI and SSE with Heritage AspenTech and made a strong progress on our ambitious transformation road maps for both the OSI and SSE businesses. I'm confident our efforts this year position us for success in fiscal \u201824 and beyond. Third, sustainability is a sizable and growing tailwind across every area of our business. We are in a great position to capitalize on increased investment from customers in areas like energy transition and electrification for years to come. As we look ahead, we expect to build on our leadership in sustainability as a key driver of our strategic priorities. And finally, we entered fiscal \u201824 with solid momentum, a cutting-edge technology stack and long-term vision for our solution that is very compelling to our customers. A big component of my confidence in our ability to deliver on these outcomes is also the incredibly talented team we have at the helm of new AspenTech today. We entered the year with the right people, processes and products in place to take full advantage of the opportunity in front of us. With that, operator, we would now like to begin the Q&A, please. Well, I mean, look, the fourth quarter was a solid quarter for HAT growth. That supported the eventual outcome that we got. Nonetheless, as you said, the growth for HAT in fiscal \u201823 was similar to fiscal \u201822, around 8.5%. And that is a result of a combination of factors, certainly chemicals. Now that chemicals completely disappeared, but probably from a growth standpoint, it contributed less than half of what it normally does. There was a little bit of back and forth throughout the year in our Russian business. And we had a quarter where China was fully closed down as well. And look, ultimately, fiscal \u201823 was an incredible year. A huge amount of work was accomplished in integration and transformation. They had a leadership team had to take on the integration and transformation of the OSI and SSE businesses. And I have no doubt that a lot of their brain cycles were dedicated to that effort as opposed to the normal execution cadence that we have in the company. Now that we're past that, I am convinced that we're going to get back to that execution cadence going forward which is what encourages me about our guidance for fiscal \u201824 in line with what we accomplished in fiscal \u201823, at least what we did in fiscal \u201823. What I would also add to Chantelle's answer, Rob, is, look, we're now entering \u201824 with the leadership team, the organization, the systems and the processes in place. That's what we worked in \u201823. \u201824 is about execution now, and that's what gives us a lot of confidence. Yes. You should assume that the 11.5% is the floor for our performance in fiscal \u201823 -- fiscal \u201824. Sorry. Yes. Well, Andrew, I believe one of the comments that we have on our prepared remarks is also how pleasantly surprised we are about the early receptivity to our term licensing model by utility customers. Frankly, we had that same belief that you just communicated at the beginning of the fiscal year and listening to the OSI team. But as we approach these customers with term licensing, the benefits of it and even some preliminary conversations around the token suite, we've seen them to be very accommodated. No doubt that they have to find ways to build that cost into their cost rate. They do go through those motions. A lot of them do. It has allowed us to do some term business or new pipeline that has closed early on. But also, we've been able to convert on pipeline that is being on a perpetual license basis, to term license business at the very end of those deal negotiations. So, yes, we understood that to be the case, but the fact is that our sales motion is proven to be otherwise in most cases. No doubt, there are some customers that prefer perpetual, but this is a transition and the progress we've made, we're very pleased with. Yes. Look, our guidance of 11.5% certainly accounts for chemicals, accounts for other potential eventualities. But on Russia, due to the different challenges that we've been facing in that market, we decided to go to a renewals-only model. So that means that we're not going to be selling anything new into Russia going forward. We will be focusing on renewing the existing business, and that's going to be our focus. So our guidance already implies that we will not see any growth from Russia. And we've also taken a little bit of a conservative approach with respect to potential attrition in Russia although we expect to renew the business that's coming to us in fiscal \u201824, we've been cautious and assume some level of attrition in Russia as we try to renew some of that business. So, going forward, AspenTech will only be renewing business. We will not be selling new entitlement to Russian customers. Well, look, it's -- if we give you that guidance of 11.5% being the floor is because we're confident about that number. If you look at the ACV growth in fiscal \u201823 and the attrition 11.8% plus 5.9%, that's about 17.7% of gross growth, new growth in fiscal \u201823 at a very strong outcome from a new growth, new business generated in fiscal \u201823. In fiscal \u201824, if you look at the guidance of at least 11.5% and the attrition at 5%, approximately 5%, that 16.5%. So, what you see in our guidance is the expectation of chemicals for the full year not contributing. We had half a year of strong contribution from chemicals in fiscal \u201823. We're assuming that chemicals will be subdued in the full year in fiscal \u201824 in there less Russia growth or no Russia growth and so that's how we come out to the 11.5%. If you look at our guidance as well on the suite -- on a per suite basis, you look at -- HAT delivered about 8.5% growth in fiscal \u201823. We're taking approximately close to double-digit growth in fiscal \u201824. OSI grew 30% in fiscal \u201823, we're guiding to almost 40% growth for the DGM suite -- sorry, I should have said DGM in fiscal \u201823, 30%, 40% in fiscal \u201824. And SSE grew by 33% in fiscal \u201823, and we're guiding to about 14%, 15% growth in fiscal \u201824. And this is solid growth across all suites because we're assuming -- we saw in Q4 a solid contribution to growth from DGM. We were conservative in our Q3 outlook for DGM considering that we were still learning around the dynamics of customers' motions to sign deals, but we're pleasantly surprised in Q4 with that outcome. So overall, look, we feel good about the trajectory for HAT in fiscal \u201824, the trajectory for DGM, the trajectory for SSE. We're going to have a greater focus on our execution and now it's about really injecting more momentum into the business as we go forward. Yes. No, look, I think fundamentally, our energy industry, refining, it's been a strong contributor. Certainly, that will be the case. Engineering accelerated to almost 8.6% growth in fiscal \u201823. By the way, that's the fastest growth rate of our engineering business since fiscal \u201814 when we grew just over 10%. So, we're really excited about the tailwinds for the engineering business from sustainability investments. I think that will continue in fiscal \u201824. We believe that MSC will continue to perform strongly. There are some products in MSC that the performance we expected as a result of execution focus in fiscal \u201823, that focus will come back. I think that will give us a lift in the same markets, refining even upstream that is taking out some of -- more of those technologies. And APM sort of similar contribution. So -- but look, I think MSC will be about focus on execution in fiscal \u201824. And just one more thing and for everyone, if you look at the presentation, the slide deck that we posted, if you look at slide 16, it has all the ACV dollars by suite over the last three years, which will allow you to calculate the growth rate for fiscal \u201823 instead of having to remember what I said. Well, let me -- look -- first of all, we're guiding to 7.5%. And I guess that would be at the high end of mid-single-digits. But look, we -- for us to get to our growth rate that we believe this business can operate at, the HAT business will be a double-digit growth business. That's our expectation. We are revisiting our expectations around the engineering business from being sort of a high mid-single-digit business to high single to double digits. I think our MSC business hit a soft spot, if you will, this year. That will recover. And we continue to have expectations about the NIM suite. This is why we made that tuck-in acquisition that we just announced. So overall, our expectation is for HAT to be a double-digit grower. Now, what I would tell you is this is on an ACV basis in the past has been an annual spend. So, there's a little bit of a step-down because of the higher base in ACV, but overall, our expectations haven't changed for that suite, okay? I mean, look, I think chemicals plays a big role in the outcome for HAT. Listen to the commentary from chemicals company CEOs, they expect chemicals to be subdued through the end of this calendar year. They are not saying anything about next year, but we assume it's more of the same, to be conservative on our guide. If this change, I could provide some upside. I'm a big believer in our MSC business. We were fully focused on executing on that business. Our engineering business shown strong resilience. But look, I think DGM, we're gaining momentum on that business as well. I look at sustainability, could be the big surprise as well here and the big benefit on sustainability is coming through the HAT suite. Electrification is what drives DGM and we're building the pipeline there. So, I know I'm sort of giving you an answer for everything, but I just think that there's just a lot of opportunity out there, and it will be just a matter of execution. So, we'll see what outperforms, but 11.5% is a floor. Look, I think we need to talk about the cadence of the full fiscal year. There was an incredible amount of work going on in Q1 and Q2 to lay the foundation, put in place the teams, the processes, the systems, are pushed into the market of SSE and DGM with term software -- or term licensing for the software. As we got into the services business, there are some things that we found there. And in a way, a lot of things came to ahead in Q3. We learned a lot out of the Q3 quarter. And I would also argue that those learnings were quickly applied early in Q4 and it was produced, what I think was much cleaner execution in Q4. There was very little learning that happened in Q4. It was more about applying what we learned from the previous three quarters. And then, I think that we are -- we generated a momentum, which is what's propelling us into fiscal 2024. So, I think it's just how the year flowed and the activities that were happening and the assumptions we made sort of all came together in the Q3 quarter, but we quickly pivoted. And I'm very proud about the job that the team did coming out of that quarter to really refocus our execution, and therefore, you have what I think is a tremendous Q4 outcome. Well, look, I've always said that if we want to sort of grow and be relevant in a new industry, we need to have an anchor asset, meaning buy something that gives us already critical mass. And therefore, the answer is yes. I still believe that in any industry that we decide to go into, the goal has to be to buy an anchor tenant, if you will. Yes. Look, I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. Again, just to reiterate the takeaways. Look, we built the foundation for the next stage of growth for the company. And I hope that's clear. We're entering fiscal \u201824 with momentum, and we believe that the guidance that we provided supports that. We continue to see strong demand around our mission-critical solutions, HAT, DGM and SSE. And we see emerging opportunities in sustainability, especially for our engineering business. So, all of this, we believe, is creating a very exciting outlook and environment for the new AspenTech. And well, our job is now to execute in fiscal \u201824. Thank you, everyone."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded.  And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Brian Denyeau, ICR. Please go ahead, sir.\nBrian Denyeau : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 ending March 31, 2023. With me on the call today are Antonio Pietri, AspenTech's President and CEO; and Chantelle Breithaupt, AspenTech's CFO. Before we begin, I will make the safe harbor statement that during the course of this call, we may make projections or other forward-looking statements about the financial performance of the company that involve risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from such projections or statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in today's call as well as those contained in our periodic reports with the SEC, including our most recently filed Form 10-K with the SEC. Although please note the following information relates to our current business conditions and our outlook as of today, April 26, 2023. Consistent with our prior practice, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update this information. Please note that we have posted our financial update presentation on the Investor Relations portion of our website. The structure of today's call will be as follows: Antonio will discuss business results of highlights from the third quarter. Chantelle will review our quarterly financials and guidance for the remainder of fiscal year 2023. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks, Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. AspenTech's third quarter performance was solid despite an uncertain macro environment, with strong demand in many of our end markets and a return to double-digit ACV growth. While we did see the macro environment have a more pronounced impact on sales during the quarter. Primarily in chemicals, we're glad to be reporting double-digit growth for the last 12 months and are on track to deliver against our initial guidance range for the full year. As we noted last quarter, chemical customers have been reporting weakness in the demand environment starting in their September calendar quarter with the drop in demand being significant in the December quarter as reported in the related earnings announcements. As a result of these dynamics, we believe the calendar year 2023 budgets reflect tighter OpEx budgets which resulted in a material pullback on software spending in the quarter for AspenTech led by bulk chemical producers. We will remain cautious about the software spending outlook from this industry for the remainder of the calendar year. Overall, we're pleased with the progress on many of our key strategic priorities through the third quarter. A key focus for us this year has been the transformation of the OSI and SSE businesses and successfully integrating them with Heritage AspenTech to compare a much larger diversified and faster growing industrial software leader. Now looking at our financial results for the third quarter. Annual contract value, or ACV, was $854.6 million up 11.2% year-over-year. Revenue was $229.9 million. GAAP loss per share was $0.89 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.06. And free cash flow was $129.3 million. Please note there were some short-term timing dynamics this quarter that Chantelle will discuss later. Looking at the quarter in more detail. We continue to see a strong demand environment in most of our end markets. Commodity prices and CapEx and OpEx budgets remain constructive, and we're seeing continued growth in our sales pipeline across all 3 businesses. AspenTech is in an enviable market position where our solutions directly address the overlapping need for increased production of energy, chemicals and electricity in a sustainable manner. We're encouraged to see that customers' investment in sustainability and their interest to invest in AspenTech solutions to meet the dual challenge remains robust. Despite the uncertain macro environment. We believe our diversified portfolio across traditional energy sources, chemicals, power transmission and distribution and emerging sustainability areas like carbon cap transferation and hydrogen give AspenTech numerous ways to benefit from these trends for the foreseeable future. I would now like to spend a moment providing details on what we're seeing in the market and our performance by vertical. Refining remains a source of strength in our business as it has been historically. While macro uncertainty exists a strong global demand for refined products is expected to keep refining margins healthy through calendar 2023. Additionally, we're seeing many refiners continue to increase investments to meet the stringent emission standards put in place by many countries globally. Including the EU's mandate for a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net 0 by 2050. As the events of the past 12 to 18 months have shown having consistent and reliable sources of energy is a security imperative that increases the need for traditional energy products until the transition is achieved. With respect to the upstream and midstream industry, the strong short and medium-term outlook for oil and gas demand is helping to drive double-digit increases in CapEx budgets in 2023. This projection is reinforced by the International energy agencies forecast of record demand for oil in 2023, reflecting the ongoing recovery in air travel and the reopening of the Chinese market after its COVID shutdown among other factors. We're seeing excellent traction with our end-to-end set of solutions for this market. The combination of heritage ajustment tech expertise in above surface upstream energy production with SSE's market-leading subsurface modeling solutions gives customers' ability to manage and optimized target exploration and production envelope and ultimately optimize entire oil and gas value chain using our solutions from the ground to the pump and across into chemicals. SSE in particular, has performed well beyond our expectations on an ACV basis year-to-date. And it is seeing very positive customer demand trends. The strong end market demand is being complemented by the transition of SSE's commercial agreements to align more closely with Heritage AspenTech which was one of the key transformation priorities for this business. For example, the recent introduction of the token-based SSE suite has received excellent feedback from customers and is contributing to grow in our pipeline. We signed several notable wins in the third quarter, including being selected by one of the leading international oil companies to be the engineering model in a simulation technology that will standardize on for facility design in their nascent carbon capture and sequestration business, which they predict could generate [billions] in future revenue for the company. This customer selected us after evaluating multiple competitors of AspenTech in the market. This win is a great example of how the SSE suite, combined with our engineering suite will support customer sustainability. The growing investment in oil and gas projects also continues to positively impact the E&C industry and customers' backlogs, accelerating the growth in spend for our engineering suite with this customer set.  In recent quarters, we have seen a steady improvement in demand from these customers as they execute on their expanded backlog of projects. More importantly, it is now clear that a significant number of our E&C customers are materially benefiting from sustainability CapEx investments by way of improved backlog growth, which in turn, is supporting greater usage of our engineering products. We believe current trends in both traditional oil and gas projects as well as newer sustainability projects represent a more durable and diversified opportunity for AspenTech in this market going forward. Shifting to the power transmission and distribution or T&D industry. This industry continues to benefit from significant investment in T&D infrastructure critical to meet the sustainability goals of the future. Making this market one of the most attractive long-term infrastructure opportunities in the world. Electrification of the global economy is driving rapid growth in demand for electricity and for our DGM solutions. Utilities recognize grids need to expand and become more reliable to handle the increased demand for electricity and additional complexity introduced by the growing mix of renewable sources of power generation. All these compounded by the rising rate of outages resulting from unpredictable storms. Additionally, hardening the security of the grid against the threat of cyber attacks is a national security issue and a top priority for these customers. We believe the only way to do this efficiently and at scale is to broader adoption of software technology. We recently validated this thesis at the industry conference Distributec, where we witnessed firsthand a high level of interest and demand for DGM product demos from many of the world's leading utility operators. We're making good progress on the ongoing transformation of the oil business and go-to-market efforts for our DGM products. One key pillar of the transformation of OSI and its go-to-market activities has been educating utility customers on the benefits of adopting the term software license model, which is happening faster than we expected. Customers are embracing the benefits of the model, such as access to term license only software capabilities and for some customers the opportunity to leverage CapEx budgets to fund these projects. This is a great outcome that will accelerate the long-term transformation of the OSI business. The introduction of the DGM token suite will soon make the full range of benefits from this licensing model available to customers. Which we believe will lead to broader deployment of the solutions in the DGM suite. While we're on track to achieve our growth target for term software ACV from new DGM product transactions for the year. We have also identified 2 items during the integration and transformation process that will have an impact on OSI's financial performance by reducing expectations for its ACV and revenue growth in the year. First, we identified several areas for improvement in OSI's project delivery organization impacting several contracts that were signed prior to the Emerson AspenTech transaction. These projects will take longer than expected to complete and thus, delay achievement of project milestones for revenue recognition. The delays also present headwinds for the recognition timing of perpetual SMS ACV booked as part of the bundled deal. And second, it has also become clear that our assumptions that we could accelerate the [PND] market sales cycle to bring it closer to Heritage AspenTech was overly optimistic. So while we're pleased with the amount of demand generation activity we're seeing in this market, we also now expect that the DGM transactions will likely take 12 to 24 months on average to complete versus Heritage AspenTech traditional 9 to 12 months. It is important to note that both dynamics will be short term in nature are well understood by our team as reflected in our model going forward. We remain incredibly optimistic about AspenTech's opportunities for growth in the E&D market. Finally, in the chemicals industry, a combination of factors, including higher energy costs and persistent supply chain challenges have led to significant destocking and declining demand for these companies resulting in a material impact on these customers' margins. This was most tolerable in the bulk chemicals market, which historically is more sensitive to macro environment than specialty chemicals. This resulted in a pullback in customers' OpEx software spending in the quarter that was more pronounced than we anticipated. For the first time this fiscal year, we saw sales cycles elongate in all regions with an increased number of deal postponements and a push out of the existing pipeline. Note that software spending from chemical customers is a primary driver of growth for our MSC suite. Despite these near-term challenges, we continue to be positive on the long-term prospects for the chemicals market and expect it to be a meaningful contributor to our growth over time. Finally, while we continue to work through the demand environment for our APM business, I would like to highlight its performance during the third quarter. APM closed a handful of meaningful transactions globally with one existing customer signing a 7-figure transaction to expand their APM deployment across several of their businesses. I would now like to share some additional customer wins from the quarter that demonstrate our success. First, one of the largest engineering companies in the world and a long-term user of our engineering suite increased their token entitlement by more than 10%. This customer is benefiting from sustainability CapEx investments for Carbon capture sequestration and hydrogen projects. As such, they are seeking to meet their engineers usage needs for their current backlog as well as their expectations for backlog growth in calendar year 2024. Second, a national oil company for the new entity to take control of exploration and production assets from their former international oil company partner. As part of this process, this new company signed an agreement with AspenTech to maintain and expand its access to our SSE products with expectations to significantly increase exploration drilling activities over the next 2, 3 years, this customer more than tripled its number of employees who now have access to SSE products. Future expansion opportunities with this customer involves signing an enterprise agreement to consolidate and expand access to other AspenTech product suite across all its holdings. Third and final is our successful win of an RSV for a long-term customer of OSI, who has deployed many of our DGM products across its grid over these years. This customer issued an RFP to replace their existing real-time data historian which was end of life by one of our industrial company competitors. After evaluating our bid versus our competitors recently acquired historian product. The customer chose OSI [indiscernible] products.  In addition, this customer has already agreed to deploy our security Authenticator open app product by November 2024. But because of our control center of grade, we're now accelerating its deployment to the spring of 2024. Furthermore, this customer is currently fulfilling a grant with the Department of Energy for a future application funded by the department to implement advanced distribution management solution capabilities, which were also quoted. This series of wins by OSI with a long-standing customer speaks to the strength of our DGM product suite significant T&D end market demand and our ability to help customers accelerate outcomes to better manage the growing complexity of the grid. Turning to our innovation investments. We were proud to release our new emissions management solution during the quarter. This new solution combines OSI technology with our traditional software expertise to consolidate customer emissions data alongside planned enterprise and battery chain OP application data into a single pain of glass view, with a holistic view of our emissions abatement targets and margins, customers can now make real decisions of the most meaningful and cost-effective ways to reduce emissions in their operations. This is an exciting example of how AspenTech can help directly reduce our customers' carbon footprint. It is also an important example of product synergies from the Emerson transaction as we will be bringing what was originally an OSI product to our energy and chemical customers. We also announced a recent partnership between AspenTech, Emerson and Microsoft that demonstrate a successful evolution of our relationship with Amazon as well as our commitment to helping energy and industrial companies advance our sustainability goals, including reaching their net 0 targets. The 3 companies partnered to install a demo of their joint hydrogen value chain solution that helps optimize CapEx investment, life cycle operating cost of production, supply chain and storage infrastructure to expedite a speed to market. In a new exhibit at the Microsoft Energy Transition Center of Excellence in Houston, which was launched at a grand opening on March 7. During the exhibit, customers were excited to see a real palpable demonstration of a solution that will help to accelerate their sustainability journeys. I would like to briefly mention our ongoing efforts efforts to leverage generative AI capabilities in our products. It is early days, but we have identified many use cases where this capability can help improve the workflow and time to value for our customers. We will provide more details on this exciting area in future calls. I would now like to provide our latest thoughts on our outlook for fiscal 2023, we're tightening our ACV growth range to 11% to 12% comprised of approximately 4 points of growth contributed by DGM and SSE and the remaining 7 to 8 points from Heritage AspenTech. This compares to our prior guidance of 10.5% to 13.5%. Our updated outlook reflects the following: first, we expect the demand environment and business dynamics that our customers experienced in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to continue in the fourth quarter. Second, the change in the high end of our up tailor range is predominantly attributable to the pullback in chemical customer software spending as well as other geopolitical considerations now impacting growth. We do not anticipate any improvement in these 2 areas in the fourth quarter. Third, DGM and SSE are still tracking to deliver approximately 4 points of growth for the year. However, the relative contribution will be different than we anticipated. SSE has meaningfully outperformed our expectations this year and is now expected to deliver the majority of the ACV growth for these 2 businesses. Conversely, extended implementation time lines for certain projects and longer sales cycles in DGM will reduce its near-term contribution to ACV growth in fiscal 2023 relative to our initial expectations. To be clear, we expect this to be only a short-term issue and is primarily a function of timing. We are very optimistic on OSI's market opportunity and expect it to be a significant growth driver over time. As we have discussed throughout fiscal 2023, we intentionally constructed our guidance with a wider range to account for the number of variables facing the business this year, including our efforts on the integration and transformation of OSI and SSE. The potential volatility in the economy and uncertainty around some of our end markets COVID and other geopolitical factors. We believe the new guidance represents a solid outcome for the year and is in line with our initial expectations in a year what we have been executing on a significant integration and transformation effort in the context of high economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Finally, we're making some changes to realign our senior leadership team to bring greater focus to our execution and especially our transformation activities. Effective today, our current Head of Global Sales, [Filipe Swales Pinto] will now report directly to me. [Filipe] is a 20-year veteran of AspenTech and has been running our global sales organization for the last 2 years. Our current CRO, [Manish Sala], will be transitioning to a new role focused on all aspects of customer success, including professional services, customer support and partners. We believe these changes will better position AspenTech to meet our future goals and objectives. Let me finish by saying that we continue to be incredibly bullish on the opportunities ahead for AspenTech. We have successfully brought Heritage AspenTech, OSI and SSE together and lay the foundation for long-term, durable, highly profitable growth. We're aligned with several highly attractive market trends that provide numerous opportunities for success. I would now like to turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you, Antonio. I will now review our financials for the third quarter fiscal 2023. As a reminder, these results are being reported under Topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings and more specifically renewable bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contract per renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years and this nonlinearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. [Lease] ACV, which we define as an estimate of the annual value of our portfolio of term license and term and perpetual software maintenance and support our SMS agreements as our primary growth metric. ACV provides insight into the annual growth of retention of our recurring revenue base which is the majority of our overall revenue as well as recurring cash flow. Although because of the Emerson transaction, the subsidiary that included the OSI and SSE businesses begin as the surviving entity. As a result, the year ago comparison, as you see in our reported financial statements only includes OSI and SSE in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, and year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful. Annual contract value was $854.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, up 11.2% year-over-year. Quarterly ACV was impacted by the medior chemicals demand the impact of certain DGM services projects that extended beyond their completion state and longer sales cycles for DGM solutions as referenced by Antonio. We are encouraged that the DGM term software and have begun to benefit from achieving favorability as we discussed last quarter. However, it will be lower than expected due to the longer sales cycles. Will show a presentation on the DGM separability today after market close to provide investors with a more detailed overview of the topic and what it means for our business going forward. This can be found on the Presentation section of our IR website. Annual spending for Heritage AspenTech, which the company defines as the annualized value of all term license and maintenance contracts at the end of the quarter for the businesses other than OSI and SSE was approximately $712 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, which increased 8.6% year-over-year and 2.1% sequentially. As a reminder, we intend to provide this annual spend disclosure for current adjustment tech-only fiscal 2023 to provide investors comparability with our historical disclosures. Total bookings was $231.3 million, a 15.4% decrease year-over-year. As a reminder, bookings are impacted by the timing of renewals, which were down year-over-year. Please refer to Slide 11 of our third quarter earnings presentation now available on our IR website for a complete description of hastening bookings. Total revenue was $229.9 million for the third quarter. In addition to the lower bookings in the quarter, there were 2 other items that weighed on our quarterly revenue performance.  First, while we are seeing accelerated demand from customers for SSE solutions, we have not yet started to extend SSE contract duration meaningfully beyond its average historical length of 1 year due to customer uncertainty from the macro environment. As a reminder, after Topic 606, contract duration impacts the amount of revenue recognized. Secondly, several OSI services projects that have extended beyond their completion, they are a headwind to revenue under OSI's historical percentages of completion accounting. We have taken several steps to avoid the outcome in the future, including accelerating the hiring to stock projects, enabling an ecosystem of third-party partners to implement services projects and instituting best practices to make the service business more predictable overall. These actions are all part of the OSI integration process and has helped to lay a solid foundation for the business. As such, we are confident about the ability to grow from this mutation line going forward. While the OSI services business did face some headwinds in the quarter, we are excited to see the accelerated conversion of DGM customers through term from perpetual license transactions in the pipeline, which is more in line with our core business model and value proposition. Now turning to profitability, beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $214.6 million. Total expenses, including cost of revenue, were $308.4 million. operating loss was $78.5 million, and net loss for the quarter was $57.6 million or $0.89 per share. Please note that the net loss includes the impact of 2 Australian dollar foreign currency derivatives related to the pending Micromine acquisition. Namely a realizing of $10.3 million of cost at line of the revenue; and secondly, a noncash loss of approximately $25.1 million related to the mark-to-market adjustment for the new derivatives entered into our third quarter. The total unrealized loss we have incurred related to the derivative activity has been approximately $40.5 million year-to-date. As an update on Micromine, we continue to work to secure the final remaining international regulatory approval in order to complete this acquisition. We remain committed to completing this transaction are very excited to bring this team and solution this [indiscernible]. Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and acquisition and integration planning related fees. We reported non-GAAP operating income of $56.8 million in the third quarter, representing a 29.1% non-GAAP operating margin. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period-to-period due to the timing of customer renewals and the resulting impact on license revenue recognition in a given quarter. Non-GAAP net income -- non-GAAP net income was $69.1 million in the quarter or $1.06 per share based on $65.2 million shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with approximately $286.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. We also fully paid down the $264 million that was outstanding on our term loan balance in the quarter. We generated $131 million of cash from operations and $129.3 million of free cash flow in the quarter after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures and capitalized software deployment payout statements. On that note, I would like to highlight 2 factors regarding free cash flow. First, we saw a meaningful impact to cash collections at the end of the quarter due to the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. SVB was one of the primary excuse by our treasury operations to accept customer payments. And it took time to direct customers to other financial institutions. This is entirely a matter of timing. And as of speaking, more than half of this cash has already been collected. Second, we no longer exclude acquisition and integration planning-related payments from our free cash flow calculation. We have made this change based on discussions with the SEC. Free cash flow presentation for our results this quarter and prior comparable periods have an updated to reflect this change. For the third quarter and year-to-date, this change in methodology impacted free cash flow by approximately 0.8% and 6.9%, respectively. I would now like to close with guidance. As a reminder, we expect the current environment from our third quarter to continue through our fiscal -- final fiscal 2023 quarter. Additionally, we are providing these updates in consideration of our progress and learning so far in transforming and integrating the OSI and SSE businesses. For ACV, we are now targeting 11% to 12% growth for the year. We maintain expectations for approximately 4 points of growth from DGM and SSE with the main impact coming from the slowdown of chemical industry software spending and other deals political considerations impacting share adjustment type. We now expect bookings to be between $1.03 billion, $1.06 billion. This includes $547 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2023 and approximately $210 million of contracts up for renewal in the fourth quarter. Total revenues are expected to be between $1.04 billion and $1.06 billion. This includes $670 million to $690 million of license and solutions revenue approximately $312 million of maintenance revenue and approximately $61 million in services and other revenue. Relative to our prior guidance, we estimate that 2/3 of this revenue adjustment is being driven by the integration and transformation factors we've spoken to earlier. And the final third being is our Heritage AspenTech business. As a reminder, revenue in our model can be volatile due to Topic 606. One of the drivers of that variability is the outsized impact of contract duration as revenue recognition is based on TCE total contract value. For Heritage AspenTech duration is approximately 4 to 5 years on average. And for SSE, while duration has remained consistent at approximately 1 year, our plan assumes that it would begin to lengthen in fiscal 2023 as part of our transformation efforts. This is why FSG revenue contribution will be lower than expected in our fiscal year, even though it is tracking ahead of plan on an ACV basis, which is the key metric for how we manage and evaluate our business. Moving to expenses for fiscal 2023. We expect a total GAAP expense range of $1.19 billion to $1.224 billion and GAAP operating loss range of $179 million to $164 million. GAAP net loss is expected to be in $110 million to $97 million for GAAP net loss per share between $1.68 to $1.48. From a non-GAAP perspective, we expect operating income to be $398 million to $413 million, for non-GAAP income per share of $5.63 to $5.83. From a free cash flow perspective, we expect to generate a minimum of $315 million in the fourth quarter being our largest free cash flow quarter of the full fiscal year. As noted previously, free cash flow guidance has been updated to reflect the change in calculation methodology. And effective January 1, 2023, we no longer exclude acquisition and integration planning-related payments from our computation in cash flow. The change in calculation methodology does not represent a change in our expectations.  For context, year-to-date acquisition and integration planning-related payments represent 4.1% of the sum over fiscal 2023 free cash flow guide in these year-to-date statements. We estimate that this change in methodology is responsible to roughly 35% of the total decrease in our fiscal 2023 free cash flow forecast using the midpoint of our prior rate presented on January 25, 2023. In addition, our free cash flow guidance for fiscal 2023 as [indiscernible] to cash tax payments of approximately $75 million. Finally, in terms of synergies, while there are certain objectives that are taking longer than anticipated, as Antonio and I have touched on today, we have made significant progress this year in aggregate. We believe we are well positioned for the long term, from both a growth and profitability perspective. As well as our ability to realize the $110 million of adjusted EBITDA synergies by 2026. To wrap up, AspenTech continues to deliver solid growth and profitability and is more challenging economic conditions. We remain on track to deliver a year of double-digit ACV growth and significant free cash flow generation while integrating and transforming OSI and SSE with Heritage AspenTech. We are confident that the progress made in fiscal 2023 has provided us with a strong foundation for accelerated growth and expanding profitability in the years to come. With that, operator, we would now like to begin the Q&A, please.\nOperator: Certainly, one moment for our first question. And our first question comes from the line of Matthew Pfau from William Blair.\nMatthew Pfau: All right. I wanted to first ask on DGM and maybe just a little bit more explanation in terms of what's going on with the sales cycles there? Are they lengthening or were they just ended up being longer than you had originally anticipated when you're doing your due diligence on the business?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, they are not lengthening in our -- during our due diligence and our model we assumed that we could bring the sales cycle for the DGM solutions to to match or be similar to those of heritage AspenTech. And as we've gotten into that business, we've recognized that a significant portion of their business is tied to government entities, whether it's municipality, a county, state or national government. And therefore, they have very rigorous procurement processes that include a request for information, request for proposals, evaluations and let negotiations. So we are realizing that it will take time to bring those sales cycles closer or be similar to AspenTech. And this is something that many years ago in inherent adjustment deck, we experience where we do business with a lot of government-owned companies. And over time, as the volume of applications or the installed base of applications in these customers' organizations increased we found ways that these customers also found ways to shorten their procurement processes, eliminate formal procurement processes with AspenTech leading to sourcing awards. So the fundamental issue that we determine is that this isn't going to happen as fast as we thought it could. And therefore, we're readjusting our expectations on how long it's going to take to close business with DGM. What I just want to say that, that impacts really the outcome that we're seeing in fiscal '23, for fiscal '24, we expect to then be in the range of the sales cycle of 12 to 24 months and start to realize in a faster closing rate and business in the year.\nMatthew Pfau: Got it. And just one more for me on what you're seeing in the chemicals market. So that's an area that you've called out as potential area of weakness over the past several quarters. Maybe just help frame what changed this quarter? What did you see this quarter? Is it a material deceleration there versus what you had been seeing?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, Matt, as we have explained in the past, customers' fiscal year budgets are tied to calendar years. And there's no doubt that while chemical customers back in the middle of 2022 calendar. We're having a good macro environment. They started to see a deterioration of their demand environment in the September quarter, certainly in the December quarter, we believe that impacted their thinking around their operating budgets for fiscal 2023, the calendar 2023. And as such, as we got deeper into the calendar -- into the -- our Q3 quarter, the March quarter, we started to see customers resisting and pushing out transactions, which we believe is just a reflection of much tighter operating budgets for software spending.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc.\nJason Celino: Maybe just for it sounds like the guidance is changing on the ACV. How should we think about the heritage annual plan metric? I know you'll only give it for 1 more quarter, but what are you providing updated guidance for that?\nAntonio Pietri: You're talking about the AspenTech guidance?\nChantelle Breithaupt: No, there is an average adjustment.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. I think we stated that we're only giving that guidance at the end of the fiscal year.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. So Jason, we only provide the outcomes each quarter for this year. The guidance for this year, AspenTech is in the 11 to 12 with the [indiscernible] of approximately 4 being in OSI and SSE and the remainder Heritance AspenTech for ACV basis.\nJason Celino: Perfect. And then this quarter, specifically reparability oncotype DGM. How much of that contributed to the 8.\nAntonio Pietri: Jay, so we're having a hard time hearing you.\nChantelle Breithaupt: He's asking how much of -- we can barely hear you. He's asking us how much of the DGM separability we've seen year-to-date or so far in the quarter. That was your question, right?\nJason Celino: Yes. Yes, that is. You can hear me and that is.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. No, that was better Yes. But so look, no doubt the separability was a big win an achievement early in January, and we reported so in the January earnings call, but as was mentioned in the prepared remarks, for the existing OSI projects or project services work achieving the project milestones is what then leads to our ability to recognize revenue and separate services revenue from the software revenue that is bundled in that project as those milestones got pushed out and some of these projects that negated the opportunity to take advantage of the separability fact. So nonetheless, that is there for some of the business that we're still recognizing and will continue to benefit us in the future.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America.\nAndrew Obin : You guys sort of highlighted geopolitical risk as one of the factors. And I was just wondering what that meant because I think you sort of highlighted, but it's not clear to me what that refers to.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. As we've stated in the past, we continue to operate our business in Russia. We've also stated in previous opportunities in investor conferences and meetings that the environment there is getting more difficult for us to transact in because of increasing actions on banks, primarily, which is constraining the availability then to get payments. But also there's a more specific push by the local government there to start using more local software or local software. So the combination of those factors is creating less is leading to less growth and greater attrition in that business which was reflected as growth in our guidance. So that's also an impact that we're seeing in our growth rate.\nAndrew Obin : Got it. That makes sense. And just another question. How should we think -- and sort of I appreciate what happened this year, and I think you've made it very clear what happened. So as we think about the path of ACV acceleration and just thinking beyond this year, you did say that it sounds like the DGM sales cycle will come in line with your expectations, right? Assuming chemical OpEx will get better and probably the comps are going to get easier. But what should we think about ACV growth accelerating over the next 2 years, what does today's changing outlook means for sort of longer-term outlook for ACV acceleration?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. No. So -- and thank you for that question, Andrew. So first of all, look, we still have strong conviction about the thesis for bringing these 3 companies together, Heritage AspenTech, OSI and SSE. Assuming that we have a steady macro environment across of our end markets, what we would expect is for the Heritage AspenTech business to perform the way it has performed historically in a normal environment, which is really double-digit growth. We believe that the OSI business it's a high-growth business in this environment of the huge investments in in transmission and distribution infrastructure and upgrades of their technology capabilities. And the SSE business, while it surprised us on the upside this year. We would expect that business to return back to a more normal rate of growth. But nonetheless, support what we believe is a rate of growth that is in the mid-teens area for for years to come. And that's how we see it. I think this year, we're dealing with many factors. We see it as a year we're basically building the foundation to launch an unbelievable business. And I think we've made great progress on building that foundation. We've uncovered a lot of then that we were not expecting. We've tested our assumptions. Some of them have turned out to be correct, others have not. But on the whole, there's no doubt that we are now -- we are now much better informed about all the different levers that we have in these 2 businesses to build and accelerate the growth going forward, supported by what we think is a sustained positive environment for sustained positive environment for chemicals. What we think in the medium to -- short to medium term will be a strong environment for oil and gas and also refining. And then eventually, with the closing of the Macromine acquisition, sustained positive environment in the mining area as well.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from R. W. Baird.\nRob Oliver: I apologize in advance, suffering from a little laryngitis here. So hopefully, you can hear me okay. I have 2 questions. Antonio, one for you, and then Chantelle a follow-up for you. Antonio, just it seems like a pretty tight turnaround by FY '24, you mean Aspen's fiscal '24 for the sales cycles to come down on DGM back towards the core assets. So just wanted to just dig in a little bit more on that, what gives you the confidence given it's -- we're kind of in Q4 right now? And then I just had a quick follow-up for Chantelle.\nAntonio Pietri: Okay. And thank you for that opportunity because it gives me for that question because it gives me the opportunity to clarify what maybe I created a confusion that I created. I don't mean to say that sales cycles are going to come down to 9 to 12 months for OSI in fiscal '24. They are still going to be 12 to 24 months, but by the time we enter fiscal '24, it will be 12 months of pipeline building and execution on deals another 12 months in fiscal '24, puts us in that range of 12 to 24 months. So we'll start to benefit from the pipeline that we've been building in fiscal '23. I hope \u2013\nQ \u2013Rob Oliver: Yes, that\u2019s clear. Okay. No, great. I appreciate the clarification. And then Chantelle, one for you. Just on around the \u2013 I know just broad perspective, you and Antonio have talked about wanting the predictability in the Emerson assets that you\u2019ve had in the core Aspen. And I get that, that\u2019s going to be a bit of a question today, given what\u2019s happening with OSI. But my question is for you around the margin side? Because I know one of the things you talked about doing to address the potential issues around staffing and projects is to make sure you\u2019re accelerating hiring its staff. And what is the potential implication for margins or variability? And how can we get comfortable around that variability on the margin side?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. I think, Robert, sorry about your laryngitis. I think there are a few things we\u2019re working on that and we continue to \u2013 or just is still clear at what we want to do in that area. So I think the majority of what allows that margin expansion. So if you look at services business now versus Heritage AspenTech gross margin of 90-plus percent. What allows that to say is the evolution of moving to a partner ecosystem where they take on the services installation delivery, we get to be a pure play software and that\u2019s well on track. We have been doing that in parallel. We\u2019re growing on \u2013 we\u2019re working with the second tier and first tier partners to scale that and ramp that. So that\u2019s very much part of our adjusted going into next year. And then the second part will just be we free baselined in the hygiene we\u2019re putting in as part of our prepared remarks on how we operate going forward. So I think those new things were very clear. And that\u2019s our continued path and agenda.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler.\nClarke Jeffries: Just a finer point on guidance, and I really appreciate that you're giving a split between how the revenue impact flow through. But specifically on the ACV, if DGM and SSE are still on track to 4 points of contribution of growth, then thinking about Heritage as the sort of difference there. I wanted to specifically ask how much of it is describable by the chemical end market? You said the word predominantly, but I just wanted to be clear about is MSC coming down, but CapEx engineering is going up. And so you're still within the range, but is there any way you could maybe further clarify chemicals contribution to the ACV movement given that we're still on track for 4 points with the DGM and SSE. And then I have one follow-up.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, so we said it in the prepared remarks, the chemicals owner operators are one of the primary contributors to growth in the MSC suite because that's where the is really used. In Heritage AspenTech chemicals, represent, I believe, about 28% of the total annual spend. I believe today on an ACV basis is about 23% of the total ACV. And as such, a slowdown in -- with our chemicals customers, those have an impact on the rate of growth of MSC. If you go back to the previous guidance, the initial guidance for the year, we were guiding MSC from 7.5 to 9.5 point of growth. We've adjusted that guidance to 7 to 8. So we still think, and we still believe that there's -- MSC will still materially contribute. On a stand-alone basis, on an ACV basis. We believe that MSC, if you compare it to annual spend to its previous baseline, it'll still be assuming that we perform we expect to perform in Q4. MSC will probably still be a double-digit growth business by the end of the fiscal year. So there's been an impact, no doubt about it. But nonetheless, that business is still performing well. I believe that, that business will find ways to also accelerate into fiscal '24, and we'll continue to execute.\nClarke Jeffries: Really appreciate it. Yes, that's the color that I was certainly looking for. And then just maybe stepping back, I mean, you had mentioned input costs as well as supply chain disruptions as maybe some of the things that were affecting those customers. But for us, maybe outside or looking in, is there anything that you particularly point to as maybe the main touch point with customers in terms of why they're they're considering a conservative outlook. Anything that we should be monitoring in terms of the main input to their confidence or their business looking forward?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, one of the main drivers the drop in demand has been destocking in this customer's customers' businesses. You have to put it and you have to go back to COVID -- the COVID years where a lot of companies have stopped up on on supplies, considering the environment, and now with, of course, an uncertain macro environment, interest rates and other things, these customers have pulled back and purchasing and are consuming their inventory that the destocking part of it. What I hear from chemical customers as we attend a conference and meet with them. That I believe that this token is coming to an end, probably most likely toward the middle of this year, and they expect to start seeing a growth in demand toward the middle of this calendar year.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our final question for today comes from the line of Mark Schappel from Loop Capital.\nMark Schappel : Chantelle question for you. I was wondering if you could just review the factors impacting free cash flow that you mentioned in your prepared remarks once again?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes, absolutely. There's very specific and very actionable. The free cash flow has 3 components. One is the change in the -- if we're taking that change from guidance is the change in the methodology. So that's about 35% of the change Mark. The other 2, roughly 1/2, so 1/3 and 1/3 is OSI and SSE, and there are 2 different drivers for OSI. It's really the movement of those completion milestones out. And so that delays the collections and the invoicing and the funds expected from that perspective. And from SSE, it's actually just pure execution on collections that we're working through as we break rigor to the team and working with our customers to get them to the Heritage AspenTech kind of cadence. Those are the 3 drivers, 1/3, 1/3 and 1/3 with 3 different actions to go from there.\nMark Schappel : Okay. Great. And then I was wondering if you just review one more time the factors impacting bookings in the quarter that I think you discussed in your prepared remarks.\nChantelle Breithaupt: I had the -- so bookings would be impacted by the renewals amount of renewals and contract duration term link for SSE. And most of my remarks were around the revenue change in the guide. I don't know if you're looking for bookings or revenue, but revenue is mostly the renewals for discussion and the SSE contract term length that we mentioned.\nOperator: Thank you, this does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Antonio Pietri for any further remarks.\nAntonio Pietri : I want to thank everyone for joining the call today, and I look forward to meeting you all as we get on the road over the next few days and weeks. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Chantelle Breithaupt",
            "content": "Thank you, Antonio. I will now review our financials for the third quarter fiscal 2023. As a reminder, these results are being reported under Topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings and more specifically renewable bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contract per renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years and this nonlinearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. [Lease] ACV, which we define as an estimate of the annual value of our portfolio of term license and term and perpetual software maintenance and support our SMS agreements as our primary growth metric. ACV provides insight into the annual growth of retention of our recurring revenue base which is the majority of our overall revenue as well as recurring cash flow. Although because of the Emerson transaction, the subsidiary that included the OSI and SSE businesses begin as the surviving entity. As a result, the year ago comparison, as you see in our reported financial statements only includes OSI and SSE in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, and year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful. Annual contract value was $854.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, up 11.2% year-over-year. Quarterly ACV was impacted by the medior chemicals demand the impact of certain DGM services projects that extended beyond their completion state and longer sales cycles for DGM solutions as referenced by Antonio. We are encouraged that the DGM term software and have begun to benefit from achieving favorability as we discussed last quarter. However, it will be lower than expected due to the longer sales cycles. Will show a presentation on the DGM separability today after market close to provide investors with a more detailed overview of the topic and what it means for our business going forward. This can be found on the Presentation section of our IR website. Annual spending for Heritage AspenTech, which the company defines as the annualized value of all term license and maintenance contracts at the end of the quarter for the businesses other than OSI and SSE was approximately $712 million at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2023, which increased 8.6% year-over-year and 2.1% sequentially. As a reminder, we intend to provide this annual spend disclosure for current adjustment tech-only fiscal 2023 to provide investors comparability with our historical disclosures. Total bookings was $231.3 million, a 15.4% decrease year-over-year. As a reminder, bookings are impacted by the timing of renewals, which were down year-over-year. Please refer to Slide 11 of our third quarter earnings presentation now available on our IR website for a complete description of hastening bookings. Total revenue was $229.9 million for the third quarter. In addition to the lower bookings in the quarter, there were 2 other items that weighed on our quarterly revenue performance.  First, while we are seeing accelerated demand from customers for SSE solutions, we have not yet started to extend SSE contract duration meaningfully beyond its average historical length of 1 year due to customer uncertainty from the macro environment. As a reminder, after Topic 606, contract duration impacts the amount of revenue recognized. Secondly, several OSI services projects that have extended beyond their completion, they are a headwind to revenue under OSI's historical percentages of completion accounting. We have taken several steps to avoid the outcome in the future, including accelerating the hiring to stock projects, enabling an ecosystem of third-party partners to implement services projects and instituting best practices to make the service business more predictable overall. These actions are all part of the OSI integration process and has helped to lay a solid foundation for the business. As such, we are confident about the ability to grow from this mutation line going forward. While the OSI services business did face some headwinds in the quarter, we are excited to see the accelerated conversion of DGM customers through term from perpetual license transactions in the pipeline, which is more in line with our core business model and value proposition. Now turning to profitability, beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $214.6 million. Total expenses, including cost of revenue, were $308.4 million. operating loss was $78.5 million, and net loss for the quarter was $57.6 million or $0.89 per share. Please note that the net loss includes the impact of 2 Australian dollar foreign currency derivatives related to the pending Micromine acquisition. Namely a realizing of $10.3 million of cost at line of the revenue; and secondly, a noncash loss of approximately $25.1 million related to the mark-to-market adjustment for the new derivatives entered into our third quarter. The total unrealized loss we have incurred related to the derivative activity has been approximately $40.5 million year-to-date. As an update on Micromine, we continue to work to secure the final remaining international regulatory approval in order to complete this acquisition. We remain committed to completing this transaction are very excited to bring this team and solution this [indiscernible]. Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and acquisition and integration planning related fees. We reported non-GAAP operating income of $56.8 million in the third quarter, representing a 29.1% non-GAAP operating margin. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period-to-period due to the timing of customer renewals and the resulting impact on license revenue recognition in a given quarter. Non-GAAP net income -- non-GAAP net income was $69.1 million in the quarter or $1.06 per share based on $65.2 million shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with approximately $286.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. We also fully paid down the $264 million that was outstanding on our term loan balance in the quarter. We generated $131 million of cash from operations and $129.3 million of free cash flow in the quarter after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures and capitalized software deployment payout statements. On that note, I would like to highlight 2 factors regarding free cash flow. First, we saw a meaningful impact to cash collections at the end of the quarter due to the Silicon Valley Bank crisis. SVB was one of the primary excuse by our treasury operations to accept customer payments. And it took time to direct customers to other financial institutions. This is entirely a matter of timing. And as of speaking, more than half of this cash has already been collected. Second, we no longer exclude acquisition and integration planning-related payments from our free cash flow calculation. We have made this change based on discussions with the SEC. Free cash flow presentation for our results this quarter and prior comparable periods have an updated to reflect this change. For the third quarter and year-to-date, this change in methodology impacted free cash flow by approximately 0.8% and 6.9%, respectively. I would now like to close with guidance. As a reminder, we expect the current environment from our third quarter to continue through our fiscal -- final fiscal 2023 quarter. Additionally, we are providing these updates in consideration of our progress and learning so far in transforming and integrating the OSI and SSE businesses. For ACV, we are now targeting 11% to 12% growth for the year. We maintain expectations for approximately 4 points of growth from DGM and SSE with the main impact coming from the slowdown of chemical industry software spending and other deals political considerations impacting share adjustment type. We now expect bookings to be between $1.03 billion, $1.06 billion. This includes $547 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2023 and approximately $210 million of contracts up for renewal in the fourth quarter. Total revenues are expected to be between $1.04 billion and $1.06 billion. This includes $670 million to $690 million of license and solutions revenue approximately $312 million of maintenance revenue and approximately $61 million in services and other revenue. Relative to our prior guidance, we estimate that 2/3 of this revenue adjustment is being driven by the integration and transformation factors we've spoken to earlier. And the final third being is our Heritage AspenTech business. As a reminder, revenue in our model can be volatile due to Topic 606. One of the drivers of that variability is the outsized impact of contract duration as revenue recognition is based on TCE total contract value. For Heritage AspenTech duration is approximately 4 to 5 years on average. And for SSE, while duration has remained consistent at approximately 1 year, our plan assumes that it would begin to lengthen in fiscal 2023 as part of our transformation efforts. This is why FSG revenue contribution will be lower than expected in our fiscal year, even though it is tracking ahead of plan on an ACV basis, which is the key metric for how we manage and evaluate our business. Moving to expenses for fiscal 2023. We expect a total GAAP expense range of $1.19 billion to $1.224 billion and GAAP operating loss range of $179 million to $164 million. GAAP net loss is expected to be in $110 million to $97 million for GAAP net loss per share between $1.68 to $1.48. From a non-GAAP perspective, we expect operating income to be $398 million to $413 million, for non-GAAP income per share of $5.63 to $5.83. From a free cash flow perspective, we expect to generate a minimum of $315 million in the fourth quarter being our largest free cash flow quarter of the full fiscal year. As noted previously, free cash flow guidance has been updated to reflect the change in calculation methodology. And effective January 1, 2023, we no longer exclude acquisition and integration planning-related payments from our computation in cash flow. The change in calculation methodology does not represent a change in our expectations.  For context, year-to-date acquisition and integration planning-related payments represent 4.1% of the sum over fiscal 2023 free cash flow guide in these year-to-date statements. We estimate that this change in methodology is responsible to roughly 35% of the total decrease in our fiscal 2023 free cash flow forecast using the midpoint of our prior rate presented on January 25, 2023. In addition, our free cash flow guidance for fiscal 2023 as [indiscernible] to cash tax payments of approximately $75 million. Finally, in terms of synergies, while there are certain objectives that are taking longer than anticipated, as Antonio and I have touched on today, we have made significant progress this year in aggregate. We believe we are well positioned for the long term, from both a growth and profitability perspective. As well as our ability to realize the $110 million of adjusted EBITDA synergies by 2026. To wrap up, AspenTech continues to deliver solid growth and profitability and is more challenging economic conditions. We remain on track to deliver a year of double-digit ACV growth and significant free cash flow generation while integrating and transforming OSI and SSE with Heritage AspenTech. We are confident that the progress made in fiscal 2023 has provided us with a strong foundation for accelerated growth and expanding profitability in the years to come. With that, operator, we would now like to begin the Q&A, please. No, there is an average adjustment. Yes. So Jason, we only provide the outcomes each quarter for this year. The guidance for this year, AspenTech is in the 11 to 12 with the [indiscernible] of approximately 4 being in OSI and SSE and the remainder Heritance AspenTech for ACV basis. He's asking how much of -- we can barely hear you. He's asking us how much of the DGM separability we've seen year-to-date or so far in the quarter. That was your question, right? Yes. I think, Robert, sorry about your laryngitis. I think there are a few things we're working on that and we continue to \u2013 or just is still clear at what we want to do in that area. So I think the majority of what allows that margin expansion. So if you look at services business now versus Heritage AspenTech gross margin of 90-plus percent. What allows that to say is the evolution of moving to a partner ecosystem where they take on the services installation delivery, we get to be a pure play software and that's well on track. We have been doing that in parallel. We're growing on \u2013 we're working with the second tier and first tier partners to scale that and ramp that. So that's very much part of our adjusted going into next year. And then the second part will just be we free baselined in the hygiene we're putting in as part of our prepared remarks on how we operate going forward. So I think those new things were very clear. And that's our continued path and agenda. Yes, absolutely. There's very specific and very actionable. The free cash flow has 3 components. One is the change in the -- if we're taking that change from guidance is the change in the methodology. So that's about 35% of the change Mark. The other 2, roughly 1/2, so 1/3 and 1/3 is OSI and SSE, and there are 2 different drivers for OSI. It's really the movement of those completion milestones out. And so that delays the collections and the invoicing and the funds expected from that perspective. And from SSE, it's actually just pure execution on collections that we're working through as we break rigor to the team and working with our customers to get them to the Heritage AspenTech kind of cadence. Those are the 3 drivers, 1/3, 1/3 and 1/3 with 3 different actions to go from there. I had the -- so bookings would be impacted by the renewals amount of renewals and contract duration term link for SSE. And most of my remarks were around the revenue change in the guide. I don't know if you're looking for bookings or revenue, but revenue is mostly the renewals for discussion and the SSE contract term length that we mentioned."

            "name": "Antonio Pietri",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. AspenTech's third quarter performance was solid despite an uncertain macro environment, with strong demand in many of our end markets and a return to double-digit ACV growth. While we did see the macro environment have a more pronounced impact on sales during the quarter. Primarily in chemicals, we're glad to be reporting double-digit growth for the last 12 months and are on track to deliver against our initial guidance range for the full year. As we noted last quarter, chemical customers have been reporting weakness in the demand environment starting in their September calendar quarter with the drop in demand being significant in the December quarter as reported in the related earnings announcements. As a result of these dynamics, we believe the calendar year 2023 budgets reflect tighter OpEx budgets which resulted in a material pullback on software spending in the quarter for AspenTech led by bulk chemical producers. We will remain cautious about the software spending outlook from this industry for the remainder of the calendar year. Overall, we're pleased with the progress on many of our key strategic priorities through the third quarter. A key focus for us this year has been the transformation of the OSI and SSE businesses and successfully integrating them with Heritage AspenTech to compare a much larger diversified and faster growing industrial software leader. Now looking at our financial results for the third quarter. Annual contract value, or ACV, was $854.6 million up 11.2% year-over-year. Revenue was $229.9 million. GAAP loss per share was $0.89 and non-GAAP EPS was $1.06. And free cash flow was $129.3 million. Please note there were some short-term timing dynamics this quarter that Chantelle will discuss later. Looking at the quarter in more detail. We continue to see a strong demand environment in most of our end markets. Commodity prices and CapEx and OpEx budgets remain constructive, and we're seeing continued growth in our sales pipeline across all 3 businesses. AspenTech is in an enviable market position where our solutions directly address the overlapping need for increased production of energy, chemicals and electricity in a sustainable manner. We're encouraged to see that customers' investment in sustainability and their interest to invest in AspenTech solutions to meet the dual challenge remains robust. Despite the uncertain macro environment. We believe our diversified portfolio across traditional energy sources, chemicals, power transmission and distribution and emerging sustainability areas like carbon cap transferation and hydrogen give AspenTech numerous ways to benefit from these trends for the foreseeable future. I would now like to spend a moment providing details on what we're seeing in the market and our performance by vertical. Refining remains a source of strength in our business as it has been historically. While macro uncertainty exists a strong global demand for refined products is expected to keep refining margins healthy through calendar 2023. Additionally, we're seeing many refiners continue to increase investments to meet the stringent emission standards put in place by many countries globally. Including the EU's mandate for a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and net 0 by 2050. As the events of the past 12 to 18 months have shown having consistent and reliable sources of energy is a security imperative that increases the need for traditional energy products until the transition is achieved. With respect to the upstream and midstream industry, the strong short and medium-term outlook for oil and gas demand is helping to drive double-digit increases in CapEx budgets in 2023. This projection is reinforced by the International energy agencies forecast of record demand for oil in 2023, reflecting the ongoing recovery in air travel and the reopening of the Chinese market after its COVID shutdown among other factors. We're seeing excellent traction with our end-to-end set of solutions for this market. The combination of heritage ajustment tech expertise in above surface upstream energy production with SSE's market-leading subsurface modeling solutions gives customers' ability to manage and optimized target exploration and production envelope and ultimately optimize entire oil and gas value chain using our solutions from the ground to the pump and across into chemicals. SSE in particular, has performed well beyond our expectations on an ACV basis year-to-date. And it is seeing very positive customer demand trends. The strong end market demand is being complemented by the transition of SSE's commercial agreements to align more closely with Heritage AspenTech which was one of the key transformation priorities for this business. For example, the recent introduction of the token-based SSE suite has received excellent feedback from customers and is contributing to grow in our pipeline. We signed several notable wins in the third quarter, including being selected by one of the leading international oil companies to be the engineering model in a simulation technology that will standardize on for facility design in their nascent carbon capture and sequestration business, which they predict could generate [billions] in future revenue for the company. This customer selected us after evaluating multiple competitors of AspenTech in the market. This win is a great example of how the SSE suite, combined with our engineering suite will support customer sustainability. The growing investment in oil and gas projects also continues to positively impact the E&C industry and customers' backlogs, accelerating the growth in spend for our engineering suite with this customer set.  In recent quarters, we have seen a steady improvement in demand from these customers as they execute on their expanded backlog of projects. More importantly, it is now clear that a significant number of our E&C customers are materially benefiting from sustainability CapEx investments by way of improved backlog growth, which in turn, is supporting greater usage of our engineering products. We believe current trends in both traditional oil and gas projects as well as newer sustainability projects represent a more durable and diversified opportunity for AspenTech in this market going forward. Shifting to the power transmission and distribution or T&D industry. This industry continues to benefit from significant investment in T&D infrastructure critical to meet the sustainability goals of the future. Making this market one of the most attractive long-term infrastructure opportunities in the world. Electrification of the global economy is driving rapid growth in demand for electricity and for our DGM solutions. Utilities recognize grids need to expand and become more reliable to handle the increased demand for electricity and additional complexity introduced by the growing mix of renewable sources of power generation. All these compounded by the rising rate of outages resulting from unpredictable storms. Additionally, hardening the security of the grid against the threat of cyber attacks is a national security issue and a top priority for these customers. We believe the only way to do this efficiently and at scale is to broader adoption of software technology. We recently validated this thesis at the industry conference Distributec, where we witnessed firsthand a high level of interest and demand for DGM product demos from many of the world's leading utility operators. We're making good progress on the ongoing transformation of the oil business and go-to-market efforts for our DGM products. One key pillar of the transformation of OSI and its go-to-market activities has been educating utility customers on the benefits of adopting the term software license model, which is happening faster than we expected. Customers are embracing the benefits of the model, such as access to term license only software capabilities and for some customers the opportunity to leverage CapEx budgets to fund these projects. This is a great outcome that will accelerate the long-term transformation of the OSI business. The introduction of the DGM token suite will soon make the full range of benefits from this licensing model available to customers. Which we believe will lead to broader deployment of the solutions in the DGM suite. While we're on track to achieve our growth target for term software ACV from new DGM product transactions for the year. We have also identified 2 items during the integration and transformation process that will have an impact on OSI's financial performance by reducing expectations for its ACV and revenue growth in the year. First, we identified several areas for improvement in OSI's project delivery organization impacting several contracts that were signed prior to the Emerson AspenTech transaction. These projects will take longer than expected to complete and thus, delay achievement of project milestones for revenue recognition. The delays also present headwinds for the recognition timing of perpetual SMS ACV booked as part of the bundled deal. And second, it has also become clear that our assumptions that we could accelerate the [PND] market sales cycle to bring it closer to Heritage AspenTech was overly optimistic. So while we're pleased with the amount of demand generation activity we're seeing in this market, we also now expect that the DGM transactions will likely take 12 to 24 months on average to complete versus Heritage AspenTech traditional 9 to 12 months. It is important to note that both dynamics will be short term in nature are well understood by our team as reflected in our model going forward. We remain incredibly optimistic about AspenTech's opportunities for growth in the E&D market. Finally, in the chemicals industry, a combination of factors, including higher energy costs and persistent supply chain challenges have led to significant destocking and declining demand for these companies resulting in a material impact on these customers' margins. This was most tolerable in the bulk chemicals market, which historically is more sensitive to macro environment than specialty chemicals. This resulted in a pullback in customers' OpEx software spending in the quarter that was more pronounced than we anticipated. For the first time this fiscal year, we saw sales cycles elongate in all regions with an increased number of deal postponements and a push out of the existing pipeline. Note that software spending from chemical customers is a primary driver of growth for our MSC suite. Despite these near-term challenges, we continue to be positive on the long-term prospects for the chemicals market and expect it to be a meaningful contributor to our growth over time. Finally, while we continue to work through the demand environment for our APM business, I would like to highlight its performance during the third quarter. APM closed a handful of meaningful transactions globally with one existing customer signing a 7-figure transaction to expand their APM deployment across several of their businesses. I would now like to share some additional customer wins from the quarter that demonstrate our success. First, one of the largest engineering companies in the world and a long-term user of our engineering suite increased their token entitlement by more than 10%. This customer is benefiting from sustainability CapEx investments for Carbon capture sequestration and hydrogen projects. As such, they are seeking to meet their engineers usage needs for their current backlog as well as their expectations for backlog growth in calendar year 2024. Second, a national oil company for the new entity to take control of exploration and production assets from their former international oil company partner. As part of this process, this new company signed an agreement with AspenTech to maintain and expand its access to our SSE products with expectations to significantly increase exploration drilling activities over the next 2, 3 years, this customer more than tripled its number of employees who now have access to SSE products. Future expansion opportunities with this customer involves signing an enterprise agreement to consolidate and expand access to other AspenTech product suite across all its holdings. Third and final is our successful win of an RSV for a long-term customer of OSI, who has deployed many of our DGM products across its grid over these years. This customer issued an RFP to replace their existing real-time data historian which was end of life by one of our industrial company competitors. After evaluating our bid versus our competitors recently acquired historian product. The customer chose OSI [indiscernible] products.  In addition, this customer has already agreed to deploy our security Authenticator open app product by November 2024. But because of our control center of grade, we're now accelerating its deployment to the spring of 2024. Furthermore, this customer is currently fulfilling a grant with the Department of Energy for a future application funded by the department to implement advanced distribution management solution capabilities, which were also quoted. This series of wins by OSI with a long-standing customer speaks to the strength of our DGM product suite significant T&D end market demand and our ability to help customers accelerate outcomes to better manage the growing complexity of the grid. Turning to our innovation investments. We were proud to release our new emissions management solution during the quarter. This new solution combines OSI technology with our traditional software expertise to consolidate customer emissions data alongside planned enterprise and battery chain OP application data into a single pain of glass view, with a holistic view of our emissions abatement targets and margins, customers can now make real decisions of the most meaningful and cost-effective ways to reduce emissions in their operations. This is an exciting example of how AspenTech can help directly reduce our customers' carbon footprint. It is also an important example of product synergies from the Emerson transaction as we will be bringing what was originally an OSI product to our energy and chemical customers. We also announced a recent partnership between AspenTech, Emerson and Microsoft that demonstrate a successful evolution of our relationship with Amazon as well as our commitment to helping energy and industrial companies advance our sustainability goals, including reaching their net 0 targets. The 3 companies partnered to install a demo of their joint hydrogen value chain solution that helps optimize CapEx investment, life cycle operating cost of production, supply chain and storage infrastructure to expedite a speed to market. In a new exhibit at the Microsoft Energy Transition Center of Excellence in Houston, which was launched at a grand opening on March 7. During the exhibit, customers were excited to see a real palpable demonstration of a solution that will help to accelerate their sustainability journeys. I would like to briefly mention our ongoing efforts efforts to leverage generative AI capabilities in our products. It is early days, but we have identified many use cases where this capability can help improve the workflow and time to value for our customers. We will provide more details on this exciting area in future calls. I would now like to provide our latest thoughts on our outlook for fiscal 2023, we're tightening our ACV growth range to 11% to 12% comprised of approximately 4 points of growth contributed by DGM and SSE and the remaining 7 to 8 points from Heritage AspenTech. This compares to our prior guidance of 10.5% to 13.5%. Our updated outlook reflects the following: first, we expect the demand environment and business dynamics that our customers experienced in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to continue in the fourth quarter. Second, the change in the high end of our up tailor range is predominantly attributable to the pullback in chemical customer software spending as well as other geopolitical considerations now impacting growth. We do not anticipate any improvement in these 2 areas in the fourth quarter. Third, DGM and SSE are still tracking to deliver approximately 4 points of growth for the year. However, the relative contribution will be different than we anticipated. SSE has meaningfully outperformed our expectations this year and is now expected to deliver the majority of the ACV growth for these 2 businesses. Conversely, extended implementation time lines for certain projects and longer sales cycles in DGM will reduce its near-term contribution to ACV growth in fiscal 2023 relative to our initial expectations. To be clear, we expect this to be only a short-term issue and is primarily a function of timing. We are very optimistic on OSI's market opportunity and expect it to be a significant growth driver over time. As we have discussed throughout fiscal 2023, we intentionally constructed our guidance with a wider range to account for the number of variables facing the business this year, including our efforts on the integration and transformation of OSI and SSE. The potential volatility in the economy and uncertainty around some of our end markets COVID and other geopolitical factors. We believe the new guidance represents a solid outcome for the year and is in line with our initial expectations in a year what we have been executing on a significant integration and transformation effort in the context of high economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Finally, we're making some changes to realign our senior leadership team to bring greater focus to our execution and especially our transformation activities. Effective today, our current Head of Global Sales, [Filipe Swales Pinto] will now report directly to me. [Filipe] is a 20-year veteran of AspenTech and has been running our global sales organization for the last 2 years. Our current CRO, [Manish Sala], will be transitioning to a new role focused on all aspects of customer success, including professional services, customer support and partners. We believe these changes will better position AspenTech to meet our future goals and objectives. Let me finish by saying that we continue to be incredibly bullish on the opportunities ahead for AspenTech. We have successfully brought Heritage AspenTech, OSI and SSE together and lay the foundation for long-term, durable, highly profitable growth. We're aligned with several highly attractive market trends that provide numerous opportunities for success. I would now like to turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle? Yes, they are not lengthening in our -- during our due diligence and our model we assumed that we could bring the sales cycle for the DGM solutions to to match or be similar to those of heritage AspenTech. And as we've gotten into that business, we've recognized that a significant portion of their business is tied to government entities, whether it's municipality, a county, state or national government. And therefore, they have very rigorous procurement processes that include a request for information, request for proposals, evaluations and let negotiations. So we are realizing that it will take time to bring those sales cycles closer or be similar to AspenTech. And this is something that many years ago in inherent adjustment deck, we experience where we do business with a lot of government-owned companies. And over time, as the volume of applications or the installed base of applications in these customers' organizations increased we found ways that these customers also found ways to shorten their procurement processes, eliminate formal procurement processes with AspenTech leading to sourcing awards. So the fundamental issue that we determine is that this isn't going to happen as fast as we thought it could. And therefore, we're readjusting our expectations on how long it's going to take to close business with DGM. What I just want to say that, that impacts really the outcome that we're seeing in fiscal '23, for fiscal '24, we expect to then be in the range of the sales cycle of 12 to 24 months and start to realize in a faster closing rate and business in the year. Yes. Look, Matt, as we have explained in the past, customers' fiscal year budgets are tied to calendar years. And there's no doubt that while chemical customers back in the middle of 2022 calendar. We're having a good macro environment. They started to see a deterioration of their demand environment in the September quarter, certainly in the December quarter, we believe that impacted their thinking around their operating budgets for fiscal 2023, the calendar 2023. And as such, as we got deeper into the calendar -- into the -- our Q3 quarter, the March quarter, we started to see customers resisting and pushing out transactions, which we believe is just a reflection of much tighter operating budgets for software spending. You're talking about the AspenTech guidance? Yes. I think we stated that we're only giving that guidance at the end of the fiscal year. Jay, so we're having a hard time hearing you. Yes. No, that was better Yes. But so look, no doubt the separability was a big win an achievement early in January, and we reported so in the January earnings call, but as was mentioned in the prepared remarks, for the existing OSI projects or project services work achieving the project milestones is what then leads to our ability to recognize revenue and separate services revenue from the software revenue that is bundled in that project as those milestones got pushed out and some of these projects that negated the opportunity to take advantage of the separability fact. So nonetheless, that is there for some of the business that we're still recognizing and will continue to benefit us in the future. Yes. As we've stated in the past, we continue to operate our business in Russia. We've also stated in previous opportunities in investor conferences and meetings that the environment there is getting more difficult for us to transact in because of increasing actions on banks, primarily, which is constraining the availability then to get payments. But also there's a more specific push by the local government there to start using more local software or local software. So the combination of those factors is creating less is leading to less growth and greater attrition in that business which was reflected as growth in our guidance. So that's also an impact that we're seeing in our growth rate. Yes. No. So -- and thank you for that question, Andrew. So first of all, look, we still have strong conviction about the thesis for bringing these 3 companies together, Heritage AspenTech, OSI and SSE. Assuming that we have a steady macro environment across of our end markets, what we would expect is for the Heritage AspenTech business to perform the way it has performed historically in a normal environment, which is really double-digit growth. We believe that the OSI business it's a high-growth business in this environment of the huge investments in in transmission and distribution infrastructure and upgrades of their technology capabilities. And the SSE business, while it surprised us on the upside this year. We would expect that business to return back to a more normal rate of growth. But nonetheless, support what we believe is a rate of growth that is in the mid-teens area for for years to come. And that's how we see it. I think this year, we're dealing with many factors. We see it as a year we're basically building the foundation to launch an unbelievable business. And I think we've made great progress on building that foundation. We've uncovered a lot of then that we were not expecting. We've tested our assumptions. Some of them have turned out to be correct, others have not. But on the whole, there's no doubt that we are now -- we are now much better informed about all the different levers that we have in these 2 businesses to build and accelerate the growth going forward, supported by what we think is a sustained positive environment for sustained positive environment for chemicals. What we think in the medium to -- short to medium term will be a strong environment for oil and gas and also refining. And then eventually, with the closing of the Macromine acquisition, sustained positive environment in the mining area as well. Okay. And thank you for that opportunity because it gives me for that question because it gives me the opportunity to clarify what maybe I created a confusion that I created. I don't mean to say that sales cycles are going to come down to 9 to 12 months for OSI in fiscal '24. They are still going to be 12 to 24 months, but by the time we enter fiscal '24, it will be 12 months of pipeline building and execution on deals another 12 months in fiscal '24, puts us in that range of 12 to 24 months. So we'll start to benefit from the pipeline that we've been building in fiscal '23. I hope \u2013\nQ \u2013Rob Oliver: Yes, that's clear. Okay. No, great. I appreciate the clarification. And then Chantelle, one for you. Just on around the \u2013 I know just broad perspective, you and Antonio have talked about wanting the predictability in the Emerson assets that you've had in the core Aspen. And I get that, that's going to be a bit of a question today, given what's happening with OSI. But my question is for you around the margin side? Because I know one of the things you talked about doing to address the potential issues around staffing and projects is to make sure you're accelerating hiring its staff. And what is the potential implication for margins or variability? And how can we get comfortable around that variability on the margin side? Yes. Look, so we said it in the prepared remarks, the chemicals owner operators are one of the primary contributors to growth in the MSC suite because that's where the is really used. In Heritage AspenTech chemicals, represent, I believe, about 28% of the total annual spend. I believe today on an ACV basis is about 23% of the total ACV. And as such, a slowdown in -- with our chemicals customers, those have an impact on the rate of growth of MSC. If you go back to the previous guidance, the initial guidance for the year, we were guiding MSC from 7.5 to 9.5 point of growth. We've adjusted that guidance to 7 to 8. So we still think, and we still believe that there's -- MSC will still materially contribute. On a stand-alone basis, on an ACV basis. We believe that MSC, if you compare it to annual spend to its previous baseline, it'll still be assuming that we perform we expect to perform in Q4. MSC will probably still be a double-digit growth business by the end of the fiscal year. So there's been an impact, no doubt about it. But nonetheless, that business is still performing well. I believe that, that business will find ways to also accelerate into fiscal '24, and we'll continue to execute. Yes. Well, one of the main drivers the drop in demand has been destocking in this customer's customers' businesses. You have to put it and you have to go back to COVID -- the COVID years where a lot of companies have stopped up on on supplies, considering the environment, and now with, of course, an uncertain macro environment, interest rates and other things, these customers have pulled back and purchasing and are consuming their inventory that the destocking part of it. What I hear from chemical customers as we attend a conference and meet with them. That I believe that this token is coming to an end, probably most likely toward the middle of this year, and they expect to start seeing a growth in demand toward the middle of this calendar year. I want to thank everyone for joining the call today, and I look forward to meeting you all as we get on the road over the next few days and weeks. Thank you."

With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks, Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. AspenTech delivered solid second quarter results as we continue to benefit from a positive demand environment in many of our core end markets. We're also seeing clear benefits from the combination of heritage AspenTech with the OSI and SSE businesses that were part of the Emerson Transaction in go-to-market activities, innovation and customer access. As I mentioned last quarter, our primary focus in the first half of the year was executing on the integration, transformation and change management plans to create unified consistent operating principles and a single business model across the entire organization. We have made substantial progress and believe our initial integration plans are largely complete. And the transformation phase of the OSI and SSE businesses is well underway. Our primary focus is in the second quarter was instituting and standardizing on best practices across our go-to-market organization, including transaction terms and conditions and the change management required to support these best practices. While we have already onboarded the OSI and SSE sales teams in the first quarter and implemented a standardized sales methodology, we're now focused on driving the execution required to deliver high-quality and long-term duration license agreements that support the financial predictability that investors are accustomed to from heritage AspenTech. This was a key area of reinforcement at our recent company-wide sales meeting in Boston from which I came away very pleased with the progress we have made towards establishing a common set of transaction best practices across all businesses and the enthusiasm and buying demonstrated by the OSI and SSE sales teams. There is still more work to do in this area, but I'm encouraged by the progress to date. In terms of synergies, we are confident on our ability to meet or exceed the synergies expected in fiscal year 2023 based on the increasing pipeline across the different growth synergy categories. The actual cost synergies achieved today, the alignment and execution between the Emerson and AspenTech teams and the completion of the key transformation requirements that capture growth in ACV in the OSI business. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance in the first half of the year and confident in our ability to execute to achieve our full year financial targets. The success we expect this year in integrating and transforming the business sets up -- and transforming the business sets up the new AspenTech well to deliver significant top and bottom line growth in the coming years. I'm highly optimistic about the opportunity ahead for AspenTech and our ability to generate significant value for our shareholders. Now looking at our financial results for the second quarter. Annual contract value or ACV was $833.7 million, up 8.7% year-over-year. Revenue was $242.8 million. GAAP loss per share was $1.02 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.35, and free cash flow was $53.1 million. I wish to provide further commentary on the quarter performance from OSI and SSE. The OSI business closed significant transactions in the quarter, in line with our expectations but because of the bundled nature of the commercial arrangements in the quarter, they did not contribute to ACV growth. In our last earnings call, we talked about the importance of achieving separability for the OSI services business as a key transformation milestone to the new agreements signed are able to be included in our ACV metric. We're excited to announce that, as expected, we recently achieved this key milestone which will allow us to begin including from OSI agreements, the DGM product term license component and the SMS component of perpetual license agreements in our ACV metric beginning this quarter. This aligns OSI with how ACV is calculated for heritage AspenTech. Chantelle will go into more detail in her prepared remarks. We also continue to be very encouraged by the prospects of the SSE business and its contribution to ACV growth as demonstrated through its contribution of the two largest ACV growth transactions in the quarter. We equally expect that as our execution in the OSI and SSE sales organizations evolves to be in line with heritage AspenTech, we will experience greater and more predictable ACV growth. Looking at the quarter in more detail, the demand environment remained positive and was similar to trends we have seen in recent quarters. We signed notable contracts in each of our key verticals and global markets and pipeline development continues to be robust. Our continued strong performance in the midst of uncertain and change in economic conditions is a testament to the relevance and resiliency of our customers' businesses and the mission criticality of new AspenTech solutions. AspenTech has an essential role to play in helping our customers meet the demand for their products that support greater global prosperity while achieving their sustainability goals and ambitions. Historically, these two areas have been viewed as being intentioned with one another and delivering on both goals is the core of our dual challenge mission. Our customers have validated its value proposition and recognize our unique position to help them meet the dual challenge. Refiners and chemical producers will need to meet the increasing demand for their products and significantly reduce their environmental impact volatilities will need to transform how electricity is generated and distributed to meet an unprecedented increase in demand. These are complicated challenges that will require elevated levels of investment for decades to come, and AspenTech is in a great position to benefit from these trends. I would now like to spend a moment providing details of what we're seeing in the market and our performance by vertical. Refining continues to perform well around the world. Refining margins are expected to remain solid through 2023, albeit down from historical highs. And overall, end market demand for refined products will continue to grow, especially for diesel and middle distillate products. The ongoing return of air travel, the upcoming import ban of refined products from Russia by the European Union and the increasing demand from the recent reopening in China are all expected to be ongoing catalyst for this market. We feel very good about the opportunity for AspenTech to drive consistently strong growth with refining customers. We had a very strong quarter and have great momentum in the power transmission and distribution or T&D market with the DGM solutions from our OSI business. We're very pleased with the sales performance of DGM in the first half of the year. The secular trends in this market are incredibly favorable given the expected vast increase in electricity demand and increasing number of energy sources that will power the grid in the future. The greater complexity from renewable power sources like wind and solar is creating more complex transmission and distribution networks, including commercial and industrial micro grids, which will require a wholesale rethinking of how to manage them. We expect this industry to have favorable investment trends for many years to come, considering the investment that will be required to transform the grid. CapEx spend in 2023 for power generation, transmission and distribution is expected to be about $1.2 trillion. One of our key growth synergy opportunities with DGM is to leverage AspenTech's global footprint starting in Europe. We have already had some exciting early wins with DGM in that market and continue to actively build out our sales capacity in that region. In December, we held the OSI user forum in Las Vegas. The event was highly successful, with 500 customer attendees, representing more than 150 utility companies from around the world. This was the first time since the pandemic started that OSI's customers gather in person. We felt great enthusiasm from customers about the future plans for the OSI business under AspenTech, especially on the establishment of an ecosystem of third-party implementers for the DGM solutions. The oil and gas industry upstream and midstream had a banner year in 2022, supported by high oil prices and strong execution discipline. Forecasts indicate oil prices will remain elevated through 2023 at an average of $80 to $90 per barrel for Brent crude for the year based on various current projections. The industry CapEx is expected to increase by 12% to $485 billion in calendar 2023, according to Energy Intelligence projections. With a significant portion of that increase coming from national oil companies. In our business, we had another strong quarter as the combination of heritage AspenTech Solutions and SSE's products has created an unmatched technology portfolio that can deliver far greater value for customers. We signed a number of quality wins with the upstream customers in the quarter, including a significant contract with one of the largest oil producers in South America, and we're also engaged with customers on the use of SSE capabilities for carbon capture and sequestration in various locations around the world. The E&C vertical did well in the second quarter and has been an important source of strength in the first half of the year. Customers in this market are benefiting from two important trends. First, in the traditional business, investment in upstream oil and gas projects has increased notably in recent quarters. The combination of strong oil prices and tight supply after several years of below average CapEx investment in the oil and gas market is supportive of E&C's backlog and headcount growth, which is positive for AspenTech. And second, E&Cs are aggressively investing in establishing engineering capabilities for sustainability investments that represent a new growth opportunity that is likely to be less cyclical than their traditional business. The CapEx investment required to meet sustainability targets in our core owner operator markets will be substantial, and we present E&Cs with sizable growth opportunities that haven't been present for several years. We're very optimistic on the outlook in this market in fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Finally, the chemicals industry had a good quarter, but does face some challenges globally and regionally in Europe. The ongoing situation in Europe and its impact on local energy supplies and consumer demand continue to weigh on chemical customers in the region. Globally, chemical customers are also experiencing a slowing demand and margin pressure as the global economy has slowed its growth. In conversations through the last quarter, many of our customers have told us they believe the current situation will recover in the second half of the calendar 2023 as economic activity picks up. We remain optimistic on the opportunity in the chemicals market, but would flag it as one of the area of our business that we are cautious on in the near term. I would now like to share some customer wins from the quarter demonstrate our success. First, an existing SSE in heritage AspenTech customer and one of the largest oil producers in South America is looking to shorten by 65%, the time it takes to get a new oilfield discovery to production. As part of this initiative, the customer evaluated multiple vendors on their knowledge automation and AI capabilities and elected to increase the spend of SSE products due to the combination of capabilities in the SSE suite. SSE has been and remains the largest incumbent in the exploration and production portfolio of software capabilities used by the customer. Second, an international utility company headquartered in the UK owns and maintains the high voltage electricity transmission network in England and Whale. This customer is investing heavily in its network of thousands of kilometers of overhead lines and underground cables and more than 300 substations to connect more and more low carbon electricity sources since that is a crucial factor to meeting net zero carbon emissions in the region. After a careful study to upgrade transmission management system and an extensive evaluation of multiple competitors, the customer selected the OSI solution because of its more mature, modern architecture and out of the box capabilities. This win opens up the opportunity to expand the use of OSI products into other operating areas and across other companies in the customers' group. And third and final, Emerson and AspenTech are having success in the market. Emerson recently announced its selection as the main automation contractor for the Ras Laffan Petrochemical Complex or RLP, a joint venture between QatarEnergy and Chevron Phillips Chemical. RLP will be the largest S&M plant in the region and one of the largest in the world. The scope of work covers automation, software and analytics capabilities, including various products from AspenTech\u2019s engineering and MSC suites. Emersons see at the table in the very early phases of the competitive process for this major construction project accelerated AspenTech's visibility into this opportunity. While AspenTech's products and solutions contributed to Emersons overall bid quality to the customer. We expect this win will open many more opportunities for both companies in the future. This win is also a good demonstration that the commercial relationship between Emerson and AspenTech is already benefiting both companies and the alignment between both commercial organizations will undoubtedly continue to grow the pipeline of business. We expect the focus on targeted growth initiatives will result in increased long-term growth and profitability for both companies through a strengthened go-to-market presence and offering. Now turning to our innovation investments. In November, we launched our new software release as aspenONE version 14, which provides augmented intelligence, guiding users to improve decision-making abilities and increased operational excellence. Introducing over 100 sustainability models, this release will help customers accelerate progress in the areas of emission management, hydrogen economy, carbon capture, material, circularity, bio-based feedstocks and renewable energy. V14 is a great example of how AspenTech will leverage our historical strength in modeling and simulation with new technologies like artificial intelligence to deliver greater value to customers through better profitability and improve sustainability. A great example of collaborative innovation in product development is our recently announced strategic partnership and licensing agreement with Saudi Aramco. As part of this agreement, we partnered with Aramco to provide to the market a unique integrated modeling and optimization solution for the sourcing and utilization of CO2. Through this solution, we expect to provide customers the ability to rapidly evaluate sources of CO2 generation and potential opportunities for use or sequestration of the CO2 and hence, design new innovative solutions that can reduce their carbon footprint while ensuring profitability. M&A is another important part of our innovative strategy, and we continue to maintain a positive posture in this area. We got off to a strong start with Emerson, which has received fantastic early feedback from customers. It greatly accelerates our AIoT industrial data and connectivity product road map and will enable greater visibility and understanding of an asset operating environment. We're also proceeding on our integration planning with MicroMine (ph) as we work towards the completion of the transaction. We expect this acquisition to close as soon as we obtain the last remaining regulatory approval, which we are actively working to secure. We have become even more impressed with the MicroMine team and products as we have gotten to know them better as this process has played out and look forward to welcoming them to AspenTech. Let me finish by providing our latest thoughts on fiscal year 2023 guidance and the second half of fiscal 2023. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on the full year ACV growth target and are maintaining the guidance range of 10.5% to 13.5%, while also maintaining our free cash flow guidance of $347 million to $362 million. Our confidence is based on our pipeline of business, the momentum building from the integration and transformation activities undertaken, the 2023 CapEx spend projections and economic outlook in our core industries. Our success in achieving these outcomes will still depend in part on continuing to successfully execute on our integration and transformation initiatives across the company. As a reminder, we have always expected the second half of the year to be a stronger contributor to growth and free cash flow given the historical buying patterns of heritage AspenTech customers and the expected timing of DGM and SSE contributions, including for the anticipated synergies. We are pleased with the performance of DGM and SSE so far, and believe the operational progress we have made in the first half of the year and our growing sales pipeline puts us on track to deliver 4 points of ACV growth from those businesses. We also continue to be mindful of the macroeconomic environment, COVID developments in China and the challenges facing the chemicals market, which we have flagged as the key variables in how we performed within our ACV growth range for the year. Before I turn it over to Chantelle, I want to reiterate how much progress we have made in the first half of the year in bringing heritage AspenTech, OSI and SSE together as one company. We have created a world-class industrial software company that is poised to accelerate growth and generate significant profitability as we execute on our long-term strategy. The new AspenTech team has done an amazing job getting us to this point, and I want to recognize their efforts and commitment to our success. So with that, let me turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you, Antonio. I will now review our financials for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. As a reminder, these results are being reported under Topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings, and more specifically, renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years and this non-linearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a reminder, we have transitioned from annual strength ACV, annual contract value as our primary growth metric. This define ACV as estimated of the annual value of our portfolio of term license and term and perpetual software maintenance and support or SMS agreements. ACV provides insight into the annual growth and retention of our recurring revenue base which is the majority of our overall revenue as well as recurring cash flow. Annual contract value was $833.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, up 8.7% year-over-year. As Antonio mentioned, we are pleased to have recently achieved separability for DGM software, which will allow us to prospectively recognize the growth of DGM term license and SMS businesses into our ACV metric on a stand-alone basis. Main contributors to this go-to-market change are the enablement of implementation service partners to operate autonomously and directly with our DGM customers. The change to OSI commercial contracts whereby the customers will be contracting for software licenses and professional services separately. And the streamlining of tools and processes for implementation services to significantly reduce complexity and interdependency with our software. We will begin to see the impact of this change at DGM beginning in this third quarter which will have a meaningful benefit to ACV in the second half of this fiscal year. It's important to note that achieving separability has multiple business benefits as well, including the general acceleration of revenue and free cash flow generation. Annual spend for [Technical Difficulty] which the company defines as the annualized value of all term license and maintenance contracts at the end of the quarter for the businesses other than OSI and SSE was approximately $697.5 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, which increased 9% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 and 2.2% sequentially. As a reminder, we intend to provide this annual spend disclosure for Heritage AspenTech only for fiscal 2023 to provide investors comparability with our historical disclosures. Total bookings, which we define as the total value of customer term license and perpetual SMS contracts signed in the current period, that's the value of term license and perpetual SMS contracts signed in the current period where the initial license have not yet being delivered under Topic 606, plus term license in perpetual SMS contracts signed in the previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period with $242.8 million, a 16.3% increase year-over-year. Total revenue was $242.8 million for the second quarter. As a reminder, as a result of the Emerson transaction, the subsidiary that included OSI and SSE businesses became the surviving entity. As a result, the year ago comparisons you see in our financial statements include OSI and SSE in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, and year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful. Now turning to profitability, beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $209.1 million. Total expenses, including cost of revenues were $302.2 million. Operating loss was $59.4 million and net loss for the quarter was $66.2 million or $1.02 per share. Please note that the net loss in the quarter reflected approximately [Technical Difficulty] of a non-cash gain related to the mark-to-market adjustment for the Australian dollar foreign currency derivatives related to the pending MicroMine acquisition. Since the inception of this foreign currency derivatives, the total net unrealized loss would we have incurred has been approximately $15.3 million. There will continue to be fluctuations until the closing of the Micromine transaction. Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, the amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition and integration planning related fees. And excluding the impact of the unrealized gain on the foreign currency derivatives. We reported non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter of $86.6 million, representing a 35.7% non-GAAP operating margin. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period to period due to the timing of customer renewals and for license revenue recognized during the quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $22.8 million or $0.35 per share based on 64.6 million shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with approximately $446.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $264 million outstanding under our term loan agreement. On December 23, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement with Emerson for an aggregate term loan commitment of $630 million. We intend to use the proceeds from borrowings under the agreement to pay in part the cash consideration for funding the pending MicroMine acquisition. Also in January, we fully paid off our existing term loan balance. In the second quarter, we generated $49.5 million of cash from operations and $53.1 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and excluding acquisition and integration planning related payments. We had a solid cash generation quarter that was in line with our expectations. Our free cash flow cadence will be more back end loaded than prior years due in part to business mix, upfront integration expenses and the timing of the expected impact of our synergy initiatives. In terms of synergies, we've made additional progress in each of our four synergy buckets, growth, business transformation, cost and the commercial agreement with Emerson. The most notable milestone was the DGM separability that we discussed earlier. We believe we are well positioned for the long term from both a growth and profitability perspective and on our ability to realize the $110 million of adjusted EBITDA synergies by 2026. I would now like to close with guidance. We have performed well in the first half of 2023 and have delivered on the business integration and transformation initiatives needed to position the business for faster ACV growth in the second half of the year. We are encouraged by the overall demand trends across the business while also being mindful of an uncertain economic outlook. To account for this uncertainty, we continue to believe maintaining a wider guidance range is prudent. With respect to ACV, we are maintaining our target of 10.5% to 13.5% growth for the year, including 4 points of growth contribution from the DGM and SSE product portfolios. We are encouraged by the transformation and integration outcomes with DGM and SSE and the trends in heritage AspenTech. We are maintaining our bookings guidance in the range of $1.07 billion to $1.17 billion, which includes $547 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2023. This includes approximately $133 million of contracts up for renewal in the third quarter. We continue to expect revenue in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.2 billion. We expect license and solutions revenue in the range of $765 million to $826 million and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $312 million and $64 million, respectively. From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $1.207 billion to $1.217 billion. Taken together, we expect GAAP operating income in a range of loss of $67 million to a loss of $15 million for fiscal 2023, with GAAP net income in the range of negative $7.5 million to a positive $32.5 million. We expect GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of a loss of $0.11 to positive $0.49. A non-GAAP perspective, we expect operating income of $503 million to $555 million and non-GAAP income per share in the range of $6.83 to $7. From a free cash flow perspective, we continue to expect free cash flow of $347 million to $352 million. Our fiscal 2023 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments in the range of $94 million to $101 million, which is unchanged. We would expect the third quarter to be the largest free cash flow quarter of the year, driven parts of the timing and cash collections for SSE's renewal portfolio. To wrap up, AspenTech is performing at a high level. We generated solid growth and profitability in the first half of the year and we believe we are well positioned to deliver on our full year financial targets. We are targeting a large and expanding market opportunity that we believe can support significant levels of growth and profitability over time. With that, operator, we would now like to begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And I show our first question comes from the line of Rob Oliver from Baird. Please go ahead.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Rob.\nRobert Oliver: Hey. Good afternoon. Hi, Antonio. Can you guys hear me okay?\nAntonio Pietri: Yeah.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yeah.\nRobert Oliver: Okay. Great. Hi, Chantelle. Just a couple of questions from me. Just first, Antonio, you talked about the phases or maybe Chantelle as you, you talked about the phases of the integration of OSI and SSE and how you've gotten through the first phase. Can you remind us of what the milestones are and what needs to be done as we enter Phase 2?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, look, Rob, in a way a lot of the key transformation milestones have been achieved. Certainly, separability was a key one for the OSI business because now it allows us to account for the growth in ACV from these transactions that we signed with customers. The release of the SSE suite and tokens for Microsoft was also a key milestone that we achieved in the Q1 quarter. We are about to release the version for Linux. And then later in the year, in the fiscal year, we will be releasing the suite and tokens for the OSI, DGM suite. There are many other smaller milestones, if you will, that are accomplished almost on a weekly basis. But fundamentally, is also about the transformation of the commercial agreements between customers and the new AspenTech for SSE is a significant set of steps to transform those agreements into what looks like a heritage AspenTech, commercial terms and conditions. And for OSI, for the majority of it is and now introducing term licensing to these customers. We did a little bit of that in Q2. There will be a lot of that done in Q3 and Q4 and going forward. But then look at some of the things that we talked about, new self-methodology, standardizing on best practices, a lot of change management going on. But I would say that the major milestones that we had hoped to achieve are in place now. And that's what we have talked about Q3 and Q4 being the quarter where we expect the results from all this work we've done in the first six months of the year to show up. I don't know, if I've missed anything, Chantelle?\nRobert Oliver: Yeah. That's very helpful, Antonio. And I had one follow-up for you. Just around the ACV guide for the full year. Acknowledging that now having now reached severability you guys are going to be able to start to book some of the new Emerson properties into ACV, which is exciting. I think under heritage Aspen, you had traditionally given a fairly tight range and then you kind of broaden that out a little bit prior to the Emerson transaction to kind of a 3 point range. You're at the 3 point range right now. And I know earlier you had been talking about being comfortable with the high end of that range. And I didn't hear you say that on this call, so -- but at the same time, I heard you say you're really comfortable with back half of the year. So I just wanted to get a sense for as you look at the end markets that you gave a lot of detail about how you feel about where we are within that range? Thanks.\nAntonio Pietri: Yeah, Rob. I appreciate the question. And look, the fact is that we're very comfortable with where we are at this point in the year on our growth in ACV trajectory. We felt that it was prudent and cautious to maintain our guidance, but I also feel a lot of confidence on the outlook for the year. And based on what I've seen so far and what we have accomplished and the outlook for our industries and customers, I feel comfortable thinking that we could come in, in the mid to upper part of our range. And the bottom part of the range is just a conservative cautious stance.\nRobert Oliver: Great. Very helpful. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Hey. How are you? Can you hear me?\nAntonio Pietri: Yeah.\nAndrew Obin: Yeah. Just so looking at heritage AspenTech, I know expense (ph) showing as acceleration. Is this more on the engineering side or manufacturing and supply chain?\nAntonio Pietri: Yeah. But look, certainly, the first half of the year has been a good year for engineering. We've seen an acceleration, and we're performing ahead of our plan in engineering. With MSC, I would say, we're tracking MSC deals tend to be -- to have a longer sales cycle, nine months to 12 months and really historically is in the Q3, Q4 quarters when we see that big wave of MSC deals. But overall, performing according to expectations.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. And just a follow-up question. I think it's more of a big picture question. Right now is sort of December, January and when we're getting really good view at the budgets of your customers for capital planning for '23. Now that you guys sort of have access to Emerson and their channels, et cetera, et cetera, how has the visibility for Aspen has changed through the relationship you have with Emerson? And what I'm referring to, like, do you guys get better visibility with the relationship now versus before? Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Well, look, certainly, as the two companies are engaging in the market, we're getting increased visibility. I do think it behooves us as separate entities to develop our own point of view, but we do share what we hear in the market. Our point of view on the macro outlook and budgets is developed -- internally developed through multiple conversations and customers over a period of time, and that's what you have in our guidance.\nChantelle Breithaupt: I would say\u2026 [Multiple Speakers] Yeah, I think the only thing I would add, Andrew, if I can take that bigger picture down to more granular, so not macro, but I think where we do have more near-term visibility is probably more at an account segment level, working with Emerson. So we have probably more granular visibility into the customer accounts, but at the macro level, as Antonio articulated.\nAndrew Obin: Got you. This is very useful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Matthew Pfau from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Matt.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nMatthew Pfau: Yeah. Hey, Antonio and Chantelle. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to first follow-up on your chemicals commentary. And is this an area that, I believe, last quarter, you sort of also called out that performance was good, but you were maybe cautious on it and keeping a close eye and this quarter you had somewhat similar commentary. But just wondering if anything has changed versus last quarter either in terms of pipeline or ability to close deals in the chemicals vertical?\nAntonio Pietri: No. Perhaps what I would say is with some customers in chemicals, we did see a little bit of longer conversations on deals. There was perhaps one or two deals that moved from Q2 into Q3 that we're now working to close. But in general, it's just a lot of conversations, a lot of meetings with chemical customers. I spent a lot of time meeting customers in the Q2 quarter. And they just express the reality of what they are facing, which is slowing demand and more pressure in margins. I think I think we all see that in the announcements that they're making with the results and guidance, forward-looking guidance we're giving, so -- but look, at the same time, as we've said, when the economic environment becomes more difficult for these customers, they also look for ways to drive efficiencies in their businesses and they turned to AspenTech historically for that as well. So just being cautious about it. I think especially this quarter as new budgets have to be executed, but we continue good engagement. We have good visibility into a pipeline of business in the quarter and into Q4 and we're just being cautious about it.\nMatthew Pfau: Okay. Great. And then on the revenue in the quarter, it was down sequentially from first quarter and we don't have a lot of history of the combined business, but in heritage Aspen, you typically would see a sequential increase from first Q to second Q. Is that related to SSE and OSI? And is this sort of some sort of seasonality that we should think about modeling going forward? Thanks.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yeah. I definitely -- I would definitely take into account Matt, the portfolio business mix coming in, and happy to follow up with you on that, but it's definitely a seasonality based on the portfolio and actually take the business models coming of SSE historically having on your terms and their calendar year and you have the OSI milestone completion. So you're going to see a different mix definitely. And it depends on the renewal cycle as well. So there's quite a few -- there are quite a few dynamics.\nAntonio Pietri: I think Matt, [indiscernible] just to emphasize the point -- that one of the points that Chantelle made, remember, the OSI revenue today is a percent of completion on projects and driven by dynamics of our projects. So it has nothing to do with software sales.\nMatthew Pfau: Okay. Understood. Very helpful. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Jason.\nJason Celino: Thanks. Hi, Antonio. Hi, Chantelle. One question on the unbundling or the separability for OSI. The price that customers pay is it -- is there any difference between when it gets separated or is it net equal from the total perspective?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yeah. Well, I think probably more to come in the sense of what's possible. I would say just the apples-to-apples answer, Jason, it's a separation of the pieces. Once it goes to third-party services that will be their conversation to have. But I would expect apples-to-apples to be fairly similar with opportunities there as we work through to demonstrate our value to see where we can take that to.\nJason Celino: Okay. Excellent. And then maybe just building off of or following up with Rob's guidance question. Can you just remind everyone what type of macro or business conditions were you kind of baking into the book ends of the range?\nAntonio Pietri: Yeah. Well, I think at the high end, in a way is what we talked about, the good budget, solid budgets into 2023. Macroeconomic conditions that support the industries that we're in. Certainly, the continued investment in expansion and upgrade of grid into utilities and more CapEx spend in upstream and midstream. That operate also supports solid chemicals spending. The low end, think about it, the opposite on the macro environment and budget, but also throwing avid, throwing regional conflicts in Europe, so those are the bookends for those two. We see China reopening from COVID and while the conflict in Europe is created certainly difficult dynamics for chemical customers. We continue to see good business from customers in Europe in refining and EPCs. The EPC industry in general around the world is on the up and up because it's a global business or what they might be headquartered in Europe, they are doing global projects. So -- but those are the factors. And 10.5 is worst case scenario, 13.5 is a great outlook.\nJason Celino: Okay. Great. That was super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Mark Schappel from Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nMark Schappel: Hi, Antonio. Hi, Chantelle. Antonio, starting with you, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned some of the Emerson Aspen integration sales efforts and milestones. I was wondering if you could just speak to any early efforts with Emerson to sell your products into other markets that Aspen historically hasn't played in such as pulp and paper and in wastewater?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, let me look at those efforts are ongoing. Of course, both Emerson and AspenTech had great familiarity with our core markets and there's big capital projects happening in oil and gas, chemicals, even in refining in the Middle East and Asia. So it's natural that some of the first wins you would see are in those four industries. At the same time, as you said, Emerson has the presence in other industries. We're enabling the sales people and teams in those industries. We're also working to determine the value proposition for some of these industries and some of the applications. And I would argue that's a longer term tail to business generation. But nonetheless, it's an ongoing effort, and it's part of our targeted initiatives especially with pharma, while AspenTech is been in pharma. Emerson has a first or second largest market share in that area and we see great opportunities for both companies with Emerson's leadership in that space.\nMark Schappel: Okay. Great. Thank you. That\u2019s all from me.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our next question comes from the line of Dustin (ph) Moskovitz from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Participant: Hi, Antonio. This is [indiscernible] on for Gal. Thanks for taking the question. So with [indiscernible] suite for Linux go on development. I was wondering whether when that comes when it becomes complete, whether there will be any incremental benefit from this because Linux operating systems generally tend to be used with larger corporations because of better safety and greater security parameters. Relative to Windows, which you guys released in fiscal Q1 and whether that could continue to drive large deals in SSE correspondingly strong contribution to ACV growth in the year. Thank you. And just one follow-up after that.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. No, Arsenio (ph), no doubt. What we've learned is that the leanest version of the operating -- our operating system is more common with higher workload applications, more sophisticated applications in the SSE suite. Perhaps applications that consume a lot more tokens as well, that suite will be released soon. And we do expect to sort of capture that incremental use. But the bulk of the SSE suite usage is with the Microsoft operating system. I do want to emphasize that.\nUnidentified Participant: Got it. And then just to follow up on the guidance question. What has to happen, I guess, to improve relative to today to get towards that top end range of guidance? Is there any call-outs in particular sectors that you would need to see perform better than what you currently seen in the first half of fiscal '23? Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I mean, look, the reason we maintained 13.5% at the high end of our guidance is because we have visibility, we'll have a path into that number. And with that, the pipeline of business and supported by synergies and then benefits from the transformation of OSI and SSC. So what needs to happen. Look, it's execution and not being impacted by some of the things that I've mentioned, COVID and conflict in Europe, so prices around transformation, the transformation of a business is not linear per se. There's always surprises in and you can always be tripped in your execution. We found some things in the last six months that were not in our assumptions, but we've been able to overcome them and we don't know of anything that could trip us in the second half of the year, but we also want to be cautious because there's a lot of we're lifting a lot of rocks and assuming that we're going to find what we think we're going to find and in some cases, we may not. So we're just being cautious about that. But if we continue to execute on the transformation that we did in the first half, then that path to 13.5% is there.\nUnidentified Participant: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And I show our last question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nClarke Jeffries : Perfect. Thank you for taking the question.\nAntonio Pietri: Hello.\nClarke Jeffries : Antonio, your Emerson held its Analyst Day in November and an quoted two metrics that stood out to me on the Aspen business, one being, 1,000 plus salespeople actively selling AspenTech and the second being 70% of Emerson control systems do not have AspenTech software. The question is, how do you expect those metrics to change in the coming calendar year? And which metric would you expect us to see the most progress in soon and which is the most meaningful near-term AspenTech?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, let me look, certainly, the -- look, I think it's a combination. The Emerson installed base is addressed by those thousands of sales people. Now they have to be trained, enabled, educated and so on. So the goal here is not to try to boil the ocean in one year because when you try to do that, you dilute yourself and you end up not being successful. I think we want to be very focused on the initiatives that we want to pursue to deliver the synergies that we've outlined for ourselves every year going forward. And that eventually will turn into many, many more salespeople selling an AspenTech into a much greater installed base. That installed base is a huge opportunity for Aspen. There are places where Emerson has tremendous market position, pharmaceuticals, China, oil and gas, midstream, LNG and some of these core industries where they're in. So we'll start focusing and working with them in each of these areas. And the fruits of our labor will show up over time. Those thousands of salespeople or the installed base that you refer to think of that as the total addressable market and we'll start eating into that TAM as time passes on.\nClarke Jeffries : Perfect. Thank you very much. And just a follow-up, Chantelle. Maybe I missed it, but could you clarify what the raise is to the high end of net income? Is that primarily the fluctuation of the currency derivative or could you clarify what the changes there to the full year guidance on EPS?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yeah. I think it would be the items that come in on that sets of their \u2013 there is some stock-based compensation in there. There's the derivative. I think those are the two moving pieces that you would see in that change, the two main drivers.\nClarke Jeffries : Thanks. Perfect. Thank you very much.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session for today. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to Antonio Pietri, CEO for closing remarks.\nAntonio Pietri: Well, thank you, everyone, and I know it's already -- is January 25, but Happy New Year to everyone. I look forward to meet in-person some of you as we engage in conferences and other activities. So thank you, and have a good evening.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chantelle Breithaupt",
            "content": "Thank you, Antonio. I will now review our financials for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. As a reminder, these results are being reported under Topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of bookings, and more specifically, renewal bookings. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years and this non-linearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a reminder, we have transitioned from annual strength ACV, annual contract value as our primary growth metric. This define ACV as estimated of the annual value of our portfolio of term license and term and perpetual software maintenance and support or SMS agreements. ACV provides insight into the annual growth and retention of our recurring revenue base which is the majority of our overall revenue as well as recurring cash flow. Annual contract value was $833.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, up 8.7% year-over-year. As Antonio mentioned, we are pleased to have recently achieved separability for DGM software, which will allow us to prospectively recognize the growth of DGM term license and SMS businesses into our ACV metric on a stand-alone basis. Main contributors to this go-to-market change are the enablement of implementation service partners to operate autonomously and directly with our DGM customers. The change to OSI commercial contracts whereby the customers will be contracting for software licenses and professional services separately. And the streamlining of tools and processes for implementation services to significantly reduce complexity and interdependency with our software. We will begin to see the impact of this change at DGM beginning in this third quarter which will have a meaningful benefit to ACV in the second half of this fiscal year. It's important to note that achieving separability has multiple business benefits as well, including the general acceleration of revenue and free cash flow generation. Annual spend for [Technical Difficulty] which the company defines as the annualized value of all term license and maintenance contracts at the end of the quarter for the businesses other than OSI and SSE was approximately $697.5 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, which increased 9% compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 and 2.2% sequentially. As a reminder, we intend to provide this annual spend disclosure for Heritage AspenTech only for fiscal 2023 to provide investors comparability with our historical disclosures. Total bookings, which we define as the total value of customer term license and perpetual SMS contracts signed in the current period, that's the value of term license and perpetual SMS contracts signed in the current period where the initial license have not yet being delivered under Topic 606, plus term license in perpetual SMS contracts signed in the previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period with $242.8 million, a 16.3% increase year-over-year. Total revenue was $242.8 million for the second quarter. As a reminder, as a result of the Emerson transaction, the subsidiary that included OSI and SSE businesses became the surviving entity. As a result, the year ago comparisons you see in our financial statements include OSI and SSE in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, and year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful. Now turning to profitability, beginning on a GAAP basis. Operating expenses for the quarter were $209.1 million. Total expenses, including cost of revenues were $302.2 million. Operating loss was $59.4 million and net loss for the quarter was $66.2 million or $1.02 per share. Please note that the net loss in the quarter reflected approximately [Technical Difficulty] of a non-cash gain related to the mark-to-market adjustment for the Australian dollar foreign currency derivatives related to the pending MicroMine acquisition. Since the inception of this foreign currency derivatives, the total net unrealized loss would we have incurred has been approximately $15.3 million. There will continue to be fluctuations until the closing of the Micromine transaction. Turning to non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, the amortization of intangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition and integration planning related fees. And excluding the impact of the unrealized gain on the foreign currency derivatives. We reported non-GAAP operating income for the second quarter of $86.6 million, representing a 35.7% non-GAAP operating margin. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period to period due to the timing of customer renewals and for license revenue recognized during the quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $22.8 million or $0.35 per share based on 64.6 million shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with approximately $446.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and $264 million outstanding under our term loan agreement. On December 23, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement with Emerson for an aggregate term loan commitment of $630 million. We intend to use the proceeds from borrowings under the agreement to pay in part the cash consideration for funding the pending MicroMine acquisition. Also in January, we fully paid off our existing term loan balance. In the second quarter, we generated $49.5 million of cash from operations and $53.1 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and excluding acquisition and integration planning related payments. We had a solid cash generation quarter that was in line with our expectations. Our free cash flow cadence will be more back end loaded than prior years due in part to business mix, upfront integration expenses and the timing of the expected impact of our synergy initiatives. In terms of synergies, we've made additional progress in each of our four synergy buckets, growth, business transformation, cost and the commercial agreement with Emerson. The most notable milestone was the DGM separability that we discussed earlier. We believe we are well positioned for the long term from both a growth and profitability perspective and on our ability to realize the $110 million of adjusted EBITDA synergies by 2026. I would now like to close with guidance. We have performed well in the first half of 2023 and have delivered on the business integration and transformation initiatives needed to position the business for faster ACV growth in the second half of the year. We are encouraged by the overall demand trends across the business while also being mindful of an uncertain economic outlook. To account for this uncertainty, we continue to believe maintaining a wider guidance range is prudent. With respect to ACV, we are maintaining our target of 10.5% to 13.5% growth for the year, including 4 points of growth contribution from the DGM and SSE product portfolios. We are encouraged by the transformation and integration outcomes with DGM and SSE and the trends in heritage AspenTech. We are maintaining our bookings guidance in the range of $1.07 billion to $1.17 billion, which includes $547 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2023. This includes approximately $133 million of contracts up for renewal in the third quarter. We continue to expect revenue in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.2 billion. We expect license and solutions revenue in the range of $765 million to $826 million and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $312 million and $64 million, respectively. From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $1.207 billion to $1.217 billion. Taken together, we expect GAAP operating income in a range of loss of $67 million to a loss of $15 million for fiscal 2023, with GAAP net income in the range of negative $7.5 million to a positive $32.5 million. We expect GAAP net loss per share to be in the range of a loss of $0.11 to positive $0.49. A non-GAAP perspective, we expect operating income of $503 million to $555 million and non-GAAP income per share in the range of $6.83 to $7. From a free cash flow perspective, we continue to expect free cash flow of $347 million to $352 million. Our fiscal 2023 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments in the range of $94 million to $101 million, which is unchanged. We would expect the third quarter to be the largest free cash flow quarter of the year, driven parts of the timing and cash collections for SSE's renewal portfolio. To wrap up, AspenTech is performing at a high level. We generated solid growth and profitability in the first half of the year and we believe we are well positioned to deliver on our full year financial targets. We are targeting a large and expanding market opportunity that we believe can support significant levels of growth and profitability over time. With that, operator, we would now like to begin the Q&A. Yeah. I would say... [Multiple Speakers] Yeah, I think the only thing I would add, Andrew, if I can take that bigger picture down to more granular, so not macro, but I think where we do have more near-term visibility is probably more at an account segment level, working with Emerson. So we have probably more granular visibility into the customer accounts, but at the macro level, as Antonio articulated. Yeah. I definitely -- I would definitely take into account Matt, the portfolio business mix coming in, and happy to follow up with you on that, but it's definitely a seasonality based on the portfolio and actually take the business models coming of SSE historically having on your terms and their calendar year and you have the OSI milestone completion. So you're going to see a different mix definitely. And it depends on the renewal cycle as well. So there's quite a few -- there are quite a few dynamics. Thank you. Yeah. Well, I think probably more to come in the sense of what's possible. I would say just the apples-to-apples answer, Jason, it's a separation of the pieces. Once it goes to third-party services that will be their conversation to have. But I would expect apples-to-apples to be fairly similar with opportunities there as we work through to demonstrate our value to see where we can take that to. Yeah. I think it would be the items that come in on that sets of their \u2013 there is some stock-based compensation in there. There's the derivative. I think those are the two moving pieces that you would see in that change, the two main drivers. Thank you."

AspenTech delivered solid second quarter results as we continue to benefit from a positive demand environment in many of our core end markets. We're also seeing clear benefits from the combination of heritage AspenTech with the OSI and SSE businesses that were part of the Emerson Transaction in go-to-market activities, innovation and customer access. As I mentioned last quarter, our primary focus in the first half of the year was executing on the integration, transformation and change management plans to create unified consistent operating principles and a single business model across the entire organization. We have made substantial progress and believe our initial integration plans are largely complete. And the transformation phase of the OSI and SSE businesses is well underway. Our primary focus is in the second quarter was instituting and standardizing on best practices across our go-to-market organization, including transaction terms and conditions and the change management required to support these best practices. While we have already onboarded the OSI and SSE sales teams in the first quarter and implemented a standardized sales methodology, we're now focused on driving the execution required to deliver high-quality and long-term duration license agreements that support the financial predictability that investors are accustomed to from heritage AspenTech. This was a key area of reinforcement at our recent company-wide sales meeting in Boston from which I came away very pleased with the progress we have made towards establishing a common set of transaction best practices across all businesses and the enthusiasm and buying demonstrated by the OSI and SSE sales teams. There is still more work to do in this area, but I'm encouraged by the progress to date. In terms of synergies, we are confident on our ability to meet or exceed the synergies expected in fiscal year 2023 based on the increasing pipeline across the different growth synergy categories. The actual cost synergies achieved today, the alignment and execution between the Emerson and AspenTech teams and the completion of the key transformation requirements that capture growth in ACV in the OSI business. Overall, I'm pleased with our performance in the first half of the year and confident in our ability to execute to achieve our full year financial targets. The success we expect this year in integrating and transforming the business sets up -- and transforming the business sets up the new AspenTech well to deliver significant top and bottom line growth in the coming years. I'm highly optimistic about the opportunity ahead for AspenTech and our ability to generate significant value for our shareholders. Now looking at our financial results for the second quarter. Annual contract value or ACV was $833.7 million, up 8.7% year-over-year. Revenue was $242.8 million. GAAP loss per share was $1.02 and non-GAAP EPS was $0.35, and free cash flow was $53.1 million. I wish to provide further commentary on the quarter performance from OSI and SSE. The OSI business closed significant transactions in the quarter, in line with our expectations but because of the bundled nature of the commercial arrangements in the quarter, they did not contribute to ACV growth. In our last earnings call, we talked about the importance of achieving separability for the OSI services business as a key transformation milestone to the new agreements signed are able to be included in our ACV metric. We're excited to announce that, as expected, we recently achieved this key milestone which will allow us to begin including from OSI agreements, the DGM product term license component and the SMS component of perpetual license agreements in our ACV metric beginning this quarter. This aligns OSI with how ACV is calculated for heritage AspenTech. Chantelle will go into more detail in her prepared remarks. We also continue to be very encouraged by the prospects of the SSE business and its contribution to ACV growth as demonstrated through its contribution of the two largest ACV growth transactions in the quarter. We equally expect that as our execution in the OSI and SSE sales organizations evolves to be in line with heritage AspenTech, we will experience greater and more predictable ACV growth. Looking at the quarter in more detail, the demand environment remained positive and was similar to trends we have seen in recent quarters. We signed notable contracts in each of our key verticals and global markets and pipeline development continues to be robust. Our continued strong performance in the midst of uncertain and change in economic conditions is a testament to the relevance and resiliency of our customers' businesses and the mission criticality of new AspenTech solutions. AspenTech has an essential role to play in helping our customers meet the demand for their products that support greater global prosperity while achieving their sustainability goals and ambitions. Historically, these two areas have been viewed as being intentioned with one another and delivering on both goals is the core of our dual challenge mission. Our customers have validated its value proposition and recognize our unique position to help them meet the dual challenge. Refiners and chemical producers will need to meet the increasing demand for their products and significantly reduce their environmental impact volatilities will need to transform how electricity is generated and distributed to meet an unprecedented increase in demand. These are complicated challenges that will require elevated levels of investment for decades to come, and AspenTech is in a great position to benefit from these trends. I would now like to spend a moment providing details of what we're seeing in the market and our performance by vertical. Refining continues to perform well around the world. Refining margins are expected to remain solid through 2023, albeit down from historical highs. And overall, end market demand for refined products will continue to grow, especially for diesel and middle distillate products. The ongoing return of air travel, the upcoming import ban of refined products from Russia by the European Union and the increasing demand from the recent reopening in China are all expected to be ongoing catalyst for this market. We feel very good about the opportunity for AspenTech to drive consistently strong growth with refining customers. We had a very strong quarter and have great momentum in the power transmission and distribution or T&D market with the DGM solutions from our OSI business. We're very pleased with the sales performance of DGM in the first half of the year. The secular trends in this market are incredibly favorable given the expected vast increase in electricity demand and increasing number of energy sources that will power the grid in the future. The greater complexity from renewable power sources like wind and solar is creating more complex transmission and distribution networks, including commercial and industrial micro grids, which will require a wholesale rethinking of how to manage them. We expect this industry to have favorable investment trends for many years to come, considering the investment that will be required to transform the grid. CapEx spend in 2023 for power generation, transmission and distribution is expected to be about $1.2 trillion. One of our key growth synergy opportunities with DGM is to leverage AspenTech's global footprint starting in Europe. We have already had some exciting early wins with DGM in that market and continue to actively build out our sales capacity in that region. In December, we held the OSI user forum in Las Vegas. The event was highly successful, with 500 customer attendees, representing more than 150 utility companies from around the world. This was the first time since the pandemic started that OSI's customers gather in person. We felt great enthusiasm from customers about the future plans for the OSI business under AspenTech, especially on the establishment of an ecosystem of third-party implementers for the DGM solutions. The oil and gas industry upstream and midstream had a banner year in 2022, supported by high oil prices and strong execution discipline. Forecasts indicate oil prices will remain elevated through 2023 at an average of $80 to $90 per barrel for Brent crude for the year based on various current projections. The industry CapEx is expected to increase by 12% to $485 billion in calendar 2023, according to Energy Intelligence projections. With a significant portion of that increase coming from national oil companies. In our business, we had another strong quarter as the combination of heritage AspenTech Solutions and SSE's products has created an unmatched technology portfolio that can deliver far greater value for customers. We signed a number of quality wins with the upstream customers in the quarter, including a significant contract with one of the largest oil producers in South America, and we're also engaged with customers on the use of SSE capabilities for carbon capture and sequestration in various locations around the world. The E&C vertical did well in the second quarter and has been an important source of strength in the first half of the year. Customers in this market are benefiting from two important trends. First, in the traditional business, investment in upstream oil and gas projects has increased notably in recent quarters. The combination of strong oil prices and tight supply after several years of below average CapEx investment in the oil and gas market is supportive of E&C's backlog and headcount growth, which is positive for AspenTech. And second, E&Cs are aggressively investing in establishing engineering capabilities for sustainability investments that represent a new growth opportunity that is likely to be less cyclical than their traditional business. The CapEx investment required to meet sustainability targets in our core owner operator markets will be substantial, and we present E&Cs with sizable growth opportunities that haven't been present for several years. We're very optimistic on the outlook in this market in fiscal year 2023 and beyond. Finally, the chemicals industry had a good quarter, but does face some challenges globally and regionally in Europe. The ongoing situation in Europe and its impact on local energy supplies and consumer demand continue to weigh on chemical customers in the region. Globally, chemical customers are also experiencing a slowing demand and margin pressure as the global economy has slowed its growth. In conversations through the last quarter, many of our customers have told us they believe the current situation will recover in the second half of the calendar 2023 as economic activity picks up. We remain optimistic on the opportunity in the chemicals market, but would flag it as one of the area of our business that we are cautious on in the near term. I would now like to share some customer wins from the quarter demonstrate our success. First, an existing SSE in heritage AspenTech customer and one of the largest oil producers in South America is looking to shorten by 65%, the time it takes to get a new oilfield discovery to production. As part of this initiative, the customer evaluated multiple vendors on their knowledge automation and AI capabilities and elected to increase the spend of SSE products due to the combination of capabilities in the SSE suite. SSE has been and remains the largest incumbent in the exploration and production portfolio of software capabilities used by the customer. Second, an international utility company headquartered in the UK owns and maintains the high voltage electricity transmission network in England and Whale. This customer is investing heavily in its network of thousands of kilometers of overhead lines and underground cables and more than 300 substations to connect more and more low carbon electricity sources since that is a crucial factor to meeting net zero carbon emissions in the region. After a careful study to upgrade transmission management system and an extensive evaluation of multiple competitors, the customer selected the OSI solution because of its more mature, modern architecture and out of the box capabilities. This win opens up the opportunity to expand the use of OSI products into other operating areas and across other companies in the customers' group. And third and final, Emerson and AspenTech are having success in the market. Emerson recently announced its selection as the main automation contractor for the Ras Laffan Petrochemical Complex or RLP, a joint venture between QatarEnergy and Chevron Phillips Chemical. RLP will be the largest S&M plant in the region and one of the largest in the world. The scope of work covers automation, software and analytics capabilities, including various products from AspenTech's engineering and MSC suites. Emersons see at the table in the very early phases of the competitive process for this major construction project accelerated AspenTech's visibility into this opportunity. While AspenTech's products and solutions contributed to Emersons overall bid quality to the customer. We expect this win will open many more opportunities for both companies in the future. This win is also a good demonstration that the commercial relationship between Emerson and AspenTech is already benefiting both companies and the alignment between both commercial organizations will undoubtedly continue to grow the pipeline of business. We expect the focus on targeted growth initiatives will result in increased long-term growth and profitability for both companies through a strengthened go-to-market presence and offering. Now turning to our innovation investments. In November, we launched our new software release as aspenONE version 14, which provides augmented intelligence, guiding users to improve decision-making abilities and increased operational excellence. Introducing over 100 sustainability models, this release will help customers accelerate progress in the areas of emission management, hydrogen economy, carbon capture, material, circularity, bio-based feedstocks and renewable energy. V14 is a great example of how AspenTech will leverage our historical strength in modeling and simulation with new technologies like artificial intelligence to deliver greater value to customers through better profitability and improve sustainability. A great example of collaborative innovation in product development is our recently announced strategic partnership and licensing agreement with Saudi Aramco. As part of this agreement, we partnered with Aramco to provide to the market a unique integrated modeling and optimization solution for the sourcing and utilization of CO2. Through this solution, we expect to provide customers the ability to rapidly evaluate sources of CO2 generation and potential opportunities for use or sequestration of the CO2 and hence, design new innovative solutions that can reduce their carbon footprint while ensuring profitability. M&A is another important part of our innovative strategy, and we continue to maintain a positive posture in this area. We got off to a strong start with Emerson, which has received fantastic early feedback from customers. It greatly accelerates our AIoT industrial data and connectivity product road map and will enable greater visibility and understanding of an asset operating environment. We're also proceeding on our integration planning with MicroMine (ph) as we work towards the completion of the transaction. We expect this acquisition to close as soon as we obtain the last remaining regulatory approval, which we are actively working to secure. We have become even more impressed with the MicroMine team and products as we have gotten to know them better as this process has played out and look forward to welcoming them to AspenTech. Let me finish by providing our latest thoughts on fiscal year 2023 guidance and the second half of fiscal 2023. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on the full year ACV growth target and are maintaining the guidance range of 10.5% to 13.5%, while also maintaining our free cash flow guidance of $347 million to $362 million. Our confidence is based on our pipeline of business, the momentum building from the integration and transformation activities undertaken, the 2023 CapEx spend projections and economic outlook in our core industries. Our success in achieving these outcomes will still depend in part on continuing to successfully execute on our integration and transformation initiatives across the company. As a reminder, we have always expected the second half of the year to be a stronger contributor to growth and free cash flow given the historical buying patterns of heritage AspenTech customers and the expected timing of DGM and SSE contributions, including for the anticipated synergies. We are pleased with the performance of DGM and SSE so far, and believe the operational progress we have made in the first half of the year and our growing sales pipeline puts us on track to deliver 4 points of ACV growth from those businesses. We also continue to be mindful of the macroeconomic environment, COVID developments in China and the challenges facing the chemicals market, which we have flagged as the key variables in how we performed within our ACV growth range for the year. Before I turn it over to Chantelle, I want to reiterate how much progress we have made in the first half of the year in bringing heritage AspenTech, OSI and SSE together as one company. We have created a world-class industrial software company that is poised to accelerate growth and generate significant profitability as we execute on our long-term strategy. The new AspenTech team has done an amazing job getting us to this point, and I want to recognize their efforts and commitment to our success. So with that, let me turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle? Hi, Rob. Yeah. Well, look, Rob, in a way a lot of the key transformation milestones have been achieved. Certainly, separability was a key one for the OSI business because now it allows us to account for the growth in ACV from these transactions that we signed with customers. The release of the SSE suite and tokens for Microsoft was also a key milestone that we achieved in the Q1 quarter. We are about to release the version for Linux. And then later in the year, in the fiscal year, we will be releasing the suite and tokens for the OSI, DGM suite. There are many other smaller milestones, if you will, that are accomplished almost on a weekly basis. But fundamentally, is also about the transformation of the commercial agreements between customers and the new AspenTech for SSE is a significant set of steps to transform those agreements into what looks like a heritage AspenTech, commercial terms and conditions. And for OSI, for the majority of it is and now introducing term licensing to these customers. We did a little bit of that in Q2. There will be a lot of that done in Q3 and Q4 and going forward. But then look at some of the things that we talked about, new self-methodology, standardizing on best practices, a lot of change management going on. But I would say that the major milestones that we had hoped to achieve are in place now. And that's what we have talked about Q3 and Q4 being the quarter where we expect the results from all this work we've done in the first six months of the year to show up. I don't know, if I've missed anything, Chantelle? Yeah, Rob. I appreciate the question. And look, the fact is that we're very comfortable with where we are at this point in the year on our growth in ACV trajectory. We felt that it was prudent and cautious to maintain our guidance, but I also feel a lot of confidence on the outlook for the year. And based on what I've seen so far and what we have accomplished and the outlook for our industries and customers, I feel comfortable thinking that we could come in, in the mid to upper part of our range. And the bottom part of the range is just a conservative cautious stance. Hi, Andrew. Yeah. Yeah. But look, certainly, the first half of the year has been a good year for engineering. We've seen an acceleration, and we're performing ahead of our plan in engineering. With MSC, I would say, we're tracking MSC deals tend to be -- to have a longer sales cycle, nine months to 12 months and really historically is in the Q3, Q4 quarters when we see that big wave of MSC deals. But overall, performing according to expectations. Well, look, certainly, as the two companies are engaging in the market, we're getting increased visibility. I do think it behooves us as separate entities to develop our own point of view, but we do share what we hear in the market. Our point of view on the macro outlook and budgets is developed -- internally developed through multiple conversations and customers over a period of time, and that's what you have in our guidance. Hi, Matt. No. Perhaps what I would say is with some customers in chemicals, we did see a little bit of longer conversations on deals. There was perhaps one or two deals that moved from Q2 into Q3 that we're now working to close. But in general, it's just a lot of conversations, a lot of meetings with chemical customers. I spent a lot of time meeting customers in the Q2 quarter. And they just express the reality of what they are facing, which is slowing demand and more pressure in margins. I think I think we all see that in the announcements that they're making with the results and guidance, forward-looking guidance we're giving, so -- but look, at the same time, as we've said, when the economic environment becomes more difficult for these customers, they also look for ways to drive efficiencies in their businesses and they turned to AspenTech historically for that as well. So just being cautious about it. I think especially this quarter as new budgets have to be executed, but we continue good engagement. We have good visibility into a pipeline of business in the quarter and into Q4 and we're just being cautious about it. I think Matt, [indiscernible] just to emphasize the point -- that one of the points that Chantelle made, remember, the OSI revenue today is a percent of completion on projects and driven by dynamics of our projects. So it has nothing to do with software sales. Hi, Jason. Yeah. Well, I think at the high end, in a way is what we talked about, the good budget, solid budgets into 2023. Macroeconomic conditions that support the industries that we're in. Certainly, the continued investment in expansion and upgrade of grid into utilities and more CapEx spend in upstream and midstream. That operate also supports solid chemicals spending. The low end, think about it, the opposite on the macro environment and budget, but also throwing avid, throwing regional conflicts in Europe, so those are the bookends for those two. We see China reopening from COVID and while the conflict in Europe is created certainly difficult dynamics for chemical customers. We continue to see good business from customers in Europe in refining and EPCs. The EPC industry in general around the world is on the up and up because it's a global business or what they might be headquartered in Europe, they are doing global projects. So -- but those are the factors. And 10.5 is worst case scenario, 13.5 is a great outlook. Yes. Well, let me look at those efforts are ongoing. Of course, both Emerson and AspenTech had great familiarity with our core markets and there's big capital projects happening in oil and gas, chemicals, even in refining in the Middle East and Asia. So it's natural that some of the first wins you would see are in those four industries. At the same time, as you said, Emerson has the presence in other industries. We're enabling the sales people and teams in those industries. We're also working to determine the value proposition for some of these industries and some of the applications. And I would argue that's a longer term tail to business generation. But nonetheless, it's an ongoing effort, and it's part of our targeted initiatives especially with pharma, while AspenTech is been in pharma. Emerson has a first or second largest market share in that area and we see great opportunities for both companies with Emerson's leadership in that space. Yes. No, Arsenio (ph), no doubt. What we've learned is that the leanest version of the operating -- our operating system is more common with higher workload applications, more sophisticated applications in the SSE suite. Perhaps applications that consume a lot more tokens as well, that suite will be released soon. And we do expect to sort of capture that incremental use. But the bulk of the SSE suite usage is with the Microsoft operating system. I do want to emphasize that. Well, I mean, look, the reason we maintained 13.5% at the high end of our guidance is because we have visibility, we'll have a path into that number. And with that, the pipeline of business and supported by synergies and then benefits from the transformation of OSI and SSC. So what needs to happen. Look, it's execution and not being impacted by some of the things that I've mentioned, COVID and conflict in Europe, so prices around transformation, the transformation of a business is not linear per se. There's always surprises in and you can always be tripped in your execution. We found some things in the last six months that were not in our assumptions, but we've been able to overcome them and we don't know of anything that could trip us in the second half of the year, but we also want to be cautious because there's a lot of we're lifting a lot of rocks and assuming that we're going to find what we think we're going to find and in some cases, we may not. So we're just being cautious about that. But if we continue to execute on the transformation that we did in the first half, then that path to 13.5% is there. Hello. Well, let me look, certainly, the -- look, I think it's a combination. The Emerson installed base is addressed by those thousands of sales people. Now they have to be trained, enabled, educated and so on. So the goal here is not to try to boil the ocean in one year because when you try to do that, you dilute yourself and you end up not being successful. I think we want to be very focused on the initiatives that we want to pursue to deliver the synergies that we've outlined for ourselves every year going forward. And that eventually will turn into many, many more salespeople selling an AspenTech into a much greater installed base. That installed base is a huge opportunity for Aspen. There are places where Emerson has tremendous market position, pharmaceuticals, China, oil and gas, midstream, LNG and some of these core industries where they're in. So we'll start focusing and working with them in each of these areas. And the fruits of our labor will show up over time. Those thousands of salespeople or the installed base that you refer to think of that as the total addressable market and we'll start eating into that TAM as time passes on. Well, thank you, everyone, and I know it's already -- is January 25, but Happy New Year to everyone. I look forward to meet in-person some of you as we engage in conferences and other activities. So thank you, and have a good evening."

With that, I'll turn to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our first fiscal quarter performance was in line with our expectations. This was an important quarter since the completion of the Emerson transaction. [Technical Difficulty] business currently on the steps of the performance on OSI and SSE businesses. We entered the fiscal year with a clear focus to execute on our integration plan after the 7.5 months of [Technical Difficulty] completed before the close of the transaction on May 16. During the quarter, we validated many of our expectations from the integration planning phase, but also learn of additional process improvements and potential synergies. We also put new processes and systems in place to support the transformation efforts that will deliver the significant growth and profitability expectations we have for the business in the coming quarters and years. Some of these include successfully validated the token licensing model and designing the suite for SSE, which was released last week for Windows. The strong release time line was achieved through the focus effort by our software development and product management teams. The SSE suite has quickly been embraced by customers that we have engaged with in these discussions. This is the first step in the transformation of the SSE business and a clear demonstration of the learnings and expertise gains from our own transformation in the 2009 to 2014 period. As we have experienced, when heritage AspenTech introduced the token licensing model for the engineering and MSC suites, customers quickly recognize that by providing the entire portfolio of products in a single suite, it is much easier to try new products and accelerate adoption under a token licensing model. We expect the latest version of the ASPEN-1 SSE suite to be released in the near future as the final component of the tokenization of the SSE product portfolio. Second, we began the process of migrating the DGM or dealer grid management product portfolio to a term contract structure with the ultimate objective being the introduction of the token licensing model and DGM Suite, which is expected to happen in the second half of this fiscal year. As a reminder, the DGM product portfolio has been historically a perpetual license business. So there is a significant transition for existing customers that needs to occur to get them onto the token licensing model while we will live with the suite and tokens when engaging new customers. The introduction of the DGM suite will also enable the cross-selling opportunity of DGM products into heritage AspenTech market where customers are accustomed to this licensing model. Third, we have signed and been awarded multiple commercial agreements for DGM products that will be implemented solely by third parties to demonstrate separability of software licenses and services. Achieving separability will result in an earlier inclusion of software licenses to ACV. Today, software licenses in the DGM business are recognized on a percent of completion basis during projects since these are considered bundled. Therefore, DGM transactions are currently not included in ACV when signed. We aim to achieve this separability within the second half of fiscal year 2023. Fourth, we have successfully onboarded and aligned the sales teams from OSI and SSE, including establishing a common sales and forecast methodology, refining territories and accounts ownership standardizing quota and commission structure and establishing cross-sell procedures. Ensuring alignment across the sales organization and the entire company is critical, and we're pleased with how we have come together throughout the first quarter. And last, we have established a commercial organization that will support Emerson's go-to-market teams in the varied territories identified for them to resell our products. Emerson has also established [indiscernible] with AspenTech product quarters that will be compensated for Siemens. Overall, we cannot be more pleased with the progress made in the partnership. In regards to the synergies expected from the transaction, we expect to deliver synergies in four areas: growth, business transformation, costs and commercial agreements. Each of the synergy streams are now broken down into sub-streams with clear team and individual accountability for each. Overall, we are pleased with the progress made in the first quarter in each sub-stream to put us on the trajectory to meet or exceeded. We have made great progress on the cost synergies already capturing a significant percentage of them. We expect to begin generating synergies in the three other areas in the second half of this fiscal year. We've been confident about our ability to deliver on the synergies. And as mentioned before, we have also identified other potential areas of opportunities. I'm very proud of the performance of the team in the first quarter. We successfully laid the foundation to set us in the right trajectory to achieve our fiscal year 2023 and longer term objectives. Now turning to our first quarter financial results. Annual contract value or ACV was $809.6 million, up 7.7% year-over-year. Revenue was $250.8 million. GAAP loss per share was $0.17 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.20 and free cash flow was $10.7 million. Additionally, we're sharing the following information to provide you with visibility into the early transformation momentum created with the DGM and SSE product portfolios in the quarter. The DGM product portfolio generated $16.9 million in software license orders not accounted for ACV results. $5.5 million, of which were term agreements and the rest perpetual. While the term licenses cannot be included in ACV when signed due to the bundled arrangement nature of the transaction, this outcome demonstrates our ability to introduce term licensing to OSI customers. We're very happy with this outcome right out of the gate, considering that it was the first full quarter since the transaction closed. For the SSE product portfolio, we saw the start of the transformation of the commercial relationship with customers. Some customers with agreements up for renewal accept the new terms of conditions typical of heritage AspenTech software agreements converted from perpetual to term license agreements and/or, in some cases, extended the term of their agreements. An example of the change in the commercial relationship with customers is the agreement with an international oil company based in the Asia-Pacific region that consolidated a legacy perpetual license agreement and multiple older contracts into one contract at a time of renewal of one of their existing agreements, signing up for a three-year term with significant growth all due to the newly perceived value in the relationship with AspenTech. Again, this is a narrow demonstration of the value creation opportunities we have with these new businesses and the changes we're making in how we will approach customer relationships. Now moving on to the macro environment. Overall, demand trends were similar to what we have seen in recent quarters. While we remain vigilant about the uncertain economic backdrop, fundamentals in each of our core end markets remains constructive. We continue to see strong deal activity across each of our key end markets and in each region around the world. Our customers recognize that the dual challenge of meeting the rising demand for resources globally with the urgent need to meaningfully reduce environmental impact will be the key strategic priority facing their businesses for many years to come. Mainly, to meet this objective will result in an increasingly difficult regulatory environment that may eventually challenge their license to operate from society. At large, meeting the dual challenge will require rethinking how our customers design and operate their assets, including their reliance on electrical power from renewables. This in turn will drive a significant investment in technologies to modernize the electrical grid, capture and sequester carbon in industrial parts and scale new energy sources, such as hydrogen, which we believe will all ultimately benefit AspenTech\u2019s business in meaningful ways and make us an increasingly strategic partner to them. As we have also seen in recent months, energy security has become a critically importantly strategic concern. It is spurring substantial new demand in areas like LNG and more broadly reinforces the fact that many of the traditional sources of energy will remain essential to securing a steady and secure flow of affordable energy for the foreseeable future. The breadth and depth of AspenTech\u2019s product portfolio and our decades of experience in this market also puts us in a unique position to benefit from these trends. I would now like to provide some more color on our performance by vertical. Refining had a solid start to the year. Demand for refined products remains strong and refiners settled into a more normalized profitability profile in the quarter following the record crack spreads earlier this year. Increase in diesel and jet fuel demand is expected to continue to climb over the next 12 months, providing greater support for improved financial performance for this quarter. Refining has long been a source of strength for AspenTech, and we believe this industry segment will continue to be well positioned in the remainder of fiscal year 2023. The upstream vertical is now a more meaningful contributor to AspenTech and had a strong quarter as we saw exciting initial demand for our SSE products. Customer feedback has been fantastic on the value of bringing together AspenTech\u2019s engineering solutions with SSE\u2019s capabilities in areas like subsurface modeling and carbon capture. Having a product portfolio that supports the entire life cycle of upstream operations is unprecedented and solidifies our leadership in this market. We believe there is significant upside potential in the coming years in the upstream market for the SSE suite as oil and gas companies increase CapEx budgets after several years of underinvestment. And the opportunities from the carbon capture and sequestration or CCS and geothermal energy become more prevalent. We also get off to a great start in the power transmission and distribution market or T&D, generating new momentum with DGM after the two-year ownership transition process for the OSI business. The scale of investment immediately decree in the coming years to support increased electricity demand and the complexity introduced by renewable sources of power, like wind, solar and hydro at large. We signed a number of important wins in DGM during the quarter, including the first multimillion dollar term license order in that business. We are very pleased with how the pipeline for this business is building and the breadth of customer conversations we\u2019re having. We believe this recognize that they will need much more sophisticated technology across their operations to manage the growing complexity of power transmission and distribution. And while it is early, we are having exciting conversations with some of our energy and clinical customers about the potential benefits of micro grids to their business. This opportunity will take time to play out, and we believe it will be significant. Chemicals had a good quarter, and we have been very pleased with how customers in this market have embraced the need to increase investments to meet the dual challenge, which for them, also includes plastics circular. In the near term, this market, particularly in Europe, will need to work through the challenges related to the energy supply disruptions from a cost and demand perspective. This is a situation that we\u2019re monitoring closely and is probably the biggest area of uncertainty in our business currently. However, in the past, we have overseen that these types of situations has benefited AspenTech as it becomes an even bigger imperative to run a petrochemical plant as efficiently as possible. Finally, we\u2019re pleased with the trends in the E&C vertical. As we have discussed in recent calls, the need for sustainability is opening up new business opportunities for E&C, which is helping to strengthen and diversify their business. For example, in 2021, over 100 CCS or carbon capture and sequestration facilities were announced. Traditional oil and gas CapEx investment is also growing meaningfully after several years of underinvestment during the pandemic. The net result of all of this is a vertical that is as well positioned as it has been in years to generate consistent growth for AspenTech. The macro environment referenced above, supported the performance of the heritage AspenTech suite in line with our expectations. As a reference, following the three agreements signed in the quarter, all of the three agreements signed in the quarter. First, one of the largest public utility companies in the United States and a decade-long customer of OSI committed to the implementation of two large scaler systems for advanced distribution management or ADMS and distributed energy management or DEM capability. We were selected following a highly competitive sales process in which they evaluated technologies from multiple competitors. This win expand the deployment of ADM solutions to its distribution and outage management business from its existing deployment in its transmission business. This expanded agreement is an important step forward in the customers\u2019 efforts to invest in its regulated businesses, accelerate its carbon reduction targets and streamline the [indiscernible] value for customers, communities and investors. I would note that we were able to successfully transition the sales process to a business contract after starting as a [indiscernible] prior to the completion of the Emerson transaction. Second, a state-owned oil company in one of the major oil-producing countries in the Eurasia region, signed a new five-year agreement using AspenTech\u2019s customary return for a range of products in the SSE portfolio. [indiscernible] as this has been a former SSE customer who has expired long ago and decided to return in part due to the broader product portfolio and vision of the new AspenTech. This new agreement sets the relationship for further expansion in the use of SSE products. And third and final, an international company and long-time AspenTech engineering suite customer expanded its total spend commitment for the third time since the renewal of the agreement in fiscal 2021 and has now increased its total spend by more than 40% in two years. This amendment increases software access to their gas business for use of the integrated front-end engineering design capabilities, including the Aspen OptiPlant product. There are many more initiatives being pursued with this customer for further expansion in the use of AspenTech products. From an innovation perspective, we have finalized a whole conversion for in aspenONE, which we will release for general availability soon, and where our continued investment in sustainability will be further demonstrated with many new application moments. Meeting the dual challenge will also require co-innovation and partnering by customers and suppliers of technology. We now have a dedicated team co-innovating with our customers where one of the most interesting developments in the partnership group, we have established to develop a solution to record, report and manage the potential CO2 emissions by leveraging several of our products. This is a great indication of the increasingly important role AspenTech is playing with our customers in the sustainability space. We will also be hosting open forum, our global conference for the Power T&D industry for users of the DGM product portfolio in Las Vegas in early December. This is an exciting opportunity for the new AspenTech to establish our vision and direction for this industry and engage with this customer growth to introduce them to the capabilities of the new company. Finally, we continue to execute on our M&A strategy. During the quarter, we acquired Inmation, a market leader in industrial real-time information management. Inmation adapts to the needs of its customers by connecting an organization\u2019s industrial data from various data sources from client-level histories to enterprise systems to create a real-time industrial data infrastructure. We will combine this capability with AspenTech\u2019s existing portfolio of plant level solutions and AI capabilities to create a unique enterprise-wide data infrastructure. We will make Inmation the cornerstone of our AIoT industrial data and connectivity business. In addition, we continue to make progress in integration planning for Micromine and are having positive conversations on how to capitalize on the opportunity in the metals and mining market. We expect the transaction will close late in our second fiscal quarter subject to regulatory approvals. I would like to wrap up with some quick thoughts business dynamics and our outlook for fiscal year 2023. We are tracking well against our full year ACV growth target of 10.5% to 13.5%, including 4 points of contribution from DGM and SSE as well as against our free cash flow guidance. As we have indicated previously, historically, the second half of the fiscal year is much stronger for heritage AspenTech. We expect the growth and synergies from DGM and SSE to begin materializing in earnest in the second half of the fiscal year considering the sales cycle for the pipeline of these products and the time required to evolve the commercial relationship with customers. We also want to reiterate that expanding trends and opportunity dynamics in the first of the fiscal year remain positive, reflecting customers calendar year 2022 budgets. As we approach the second half of the fiscal year, today, we remain optimistic that customer budgets for calendar 2023 will be supported. Anecdotally, we heard positive feedback from customer oil and gas CapEx budgets for next year. Also, please recall that budgets in the power T&D markets are typically regulated, so there\u2019s a good deal of disability in that market. While our customers businesses have continued to do well, we recognized that they face a number of potential challenges, particularly in the chemicals market in the near term. As a reminder, our guidance range was intentionally set wider than normal to account for a range of outcomes that also include geopolitical considerations. We believe that was prudent back in August and we continue to think is the right approach. Let me wrap up by saying how please I am with the progress we made in the first quarter, the hard work by everyone at new AspenTech to bring together these three businesses in such a short time has been a great success. We have set a stage to deliver on the growth and financial objectives we have guided to for fiscal year 2023 and beyond. With that, let me turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. As a reminder, these results are being reported under Topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of booking and more specifically renewal booking. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years and this nonlinearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a reminder, we have transitioned from annual spend to ACV, annual contract value, as our primary growth metric. We define ACV as an estimate of the annual value of our portfolio of term license and term and perpetual software maintenance and support or SMS agreement. ACV provides insight into our annual growth and retention of our recurring revenue base, which is the majority of our overall revenue as well as recurring cash flow. Annual contract value was $809.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up 7.7% year-over-year. This includes approximately $2.7 million of contribution from the recently acquired business of inmation. Please also note that we booked a $1.7 million reduction in ACV during this quarter due to a Russia sanction related write off. As Antonio mentioned, while we work through the transition of the DGM portfolio to term licenses, orders from this business are not included in ACV when signed due to the lack of separability from the AspenTech provided services. We expect DGM to contribute more meaningfully to ACV in the second half of this fiscal year after we achieve separability. Annual spend for heritage AspenTech, which the company defines as the annualized value of all term license and maintenance contracts at the end of the quarter for the businesses other than OSI and SSE was approximately $682.3 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which increased 8.3% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and 1.2% subsequently. This includes approximately $1.6 million of contribution from inmation. As a reminder, we intend to provide this disclosure on annual spend for heritage AspenTech only for fiscal 2023 to provide investors comparability with our historical disclosures. Total bookings, which we define as the total value of customer term license and perpetual SMS contract signs in the current period left the value of term license and perpetual SMS contract signed in the current period, but where the initial licenses are not yet being delivered under Topic 606. Plus term license and perpetual SMS contracts signed in the previous period for which the initial licenses are deem delivered in the current period was $224 million, a 43% increase year-over-year. Total revenue was $250.8 million for the first quarter. As a reminder, as a result of the Emerson transaction, the subsidiary that included the DGM and SSE businesses became the surviving entity. As a result, the year ago comparisons you see in our financial statements only include DGM and SSE in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, and year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful. Turning to profitability beginning on a GAAP basis. operating expenses for the quarter were $210.9 million. Total expenses including cost of revenue were $302 million. Operating loss was $51.2 million and net loss for a quarter was $11.2 million or $0.17 per share. The net loss reflects the non-cash expense recognized for the mark-to-market adjustment for an Australia dollar foreign currency derivative related to the announced Micromine acquisition. This will continue to fluctuate until the closing of the transaction. Turning to non-GAAP results, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of the tangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition related fees, and excluding the impact of the unrealized loss on the foreign currency derivative, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter of $92.6 million, representing a 36.9% non-GAAP operating margin. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period to period due to the timing of customer renewals and therefore license revenue recognized during the quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $142 million or $2.20 per share based on 64.5 million shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with approximately $382.5 million of cash and cash equivalent and $270 million outstanding under our credit facility. During the quarter, we spend approximately $75 million for the acquisition of inmation. As Antonio highlighted. We are excited to bring inmation together with AspenTech and believe it is a great example of the opportunity we have to expand our product portfolio and increase the value we deliver for customers via acquisitions. From a financial perspective, inmation is expected to be immaterial in fiscal 2023 from a revenue of profitability and ACV contribution perspective. In the first quarter, we generated $5.1 million of cash from operations and $10.7 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and excluding acquisition and integration planning related payments. As a reminder, the first quarter is typically our lowest cash flow quarter due primarily to the seasonality of cash collection. I would now like to close with guidance. We have gotten off to a strong start in fiscal 2023 and we see positive underlying demand trends across the business. Our outlook for fiscal 2023 reflects these trends while also considering a wider range of potential outcomes to reflect the growing uncertainty in the economy. And finish with the progress that we have made on our integration initiatives during the quarter. We believe we are well positioned for the long term from a growth and profitability perspective and our ability to realize the $110 million of adjusted EBITDA synergy by 2026. With respect to ACV, we are maintaining a target of 10.5% to 13.5% growth for the year, including four points of growth contribution from the DGM and SSE product portfolios. The spending environment remains favorable overall and we believe we on track to drive greater contribution from the DGM and SSE portfolios in the second half of the year. We are maintaining our bookings in the range of $1.07 billion to $1.17 billion, which includes $547 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2023. This includes approximately $111 million of contract up for renewal in the second quarter. We continue to expect revenue in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.2 billion. We expect license revenue in the range of $765 million to $826 million and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $312 million and $64 million, respectively. From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $1.197 to $1.207 billion, but increased expense outlook is related to acquisition, integration planning, and amortization of purchase and tangible expenses associated with inmation acquisition. Taking together, we expect GAAP operating loss in a range of $57 million to $5 million for fiscal 2023 with GAAP net loss in the range of $32.5 million to $22.5 million. We expect GAAP net loss per share to in the range of $0.49 to $0.34. From a non-GAAP perspective, we expect operating income of $503 million to $555 million and non-GAAP income per share in the range of $6.76 to $6.91. From a free cash flow perspective, we continue to expect free cash flow of $347 to $362 million. Our fiscal 2023 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments in the range of $94 million to $104 million, which is unchanged. To wrap up, AspenTech is off to a strong start in fiscal 2023. We are successfully executing on our integration plan and have set the foundation to deliver on our near and long-term financial objectives. We believe we are uniquely positioned to create even greater value for our customers and shareholders over the long term and our keenly focused on maximizing the opportunity. With that operator, let\u2019s begin with Q&A.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matt Pfau from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Matt.\nMatt Pfau: Hey. Hey, Antonio. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Appreciate it. You wanted to ask, appreciate that you left the guidance ranges the same for your key metrics to account for a range of macro outcomes. But with another quarter of data points and conversations with customers, do you feel any differently about the probability of the low end versus the high end there?\nAntonio Pietri: Oh, let me look at like we said in our prepared remarks, Matt, today, we see a solid micro environment out there for our customers or prices have remained in a very good range for these customers. The industry continues to execute on what our CapEx budgets resulting from investment approved for them by local governments and other type of entities. And as we said, it\u2019s only chemicals, especially European companies where we\u2019re seeing at degradation of the performance around revenue growth and margin. But we\u2019ve also seen that sort of situation before where these customers also decide to invest more on technology to drive greater efficiencies to try to overcome the marketing degradation. So overall, today, we feel like the macro environment has remained and will remain through the remainder of this calendar year. And so far what we\u2019ve heard anecdotally is that budgets will still be solid for calendar year 2023. The refining industry, if anything continues to improve their performance, if you look at the results announced by some of the independent refiners here in the U.S., incredible results. So overall, we\u2019ve been good about the outlook as of today.\nMatt Pfau: And then on the increased focused on energy security and your expectation to benefit from that, is that something you\u2019re already seeing play out in your business or is that something that will take some time to materialize? Thanks.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, no, look, I think some of that is already playing out through a final investment decisions around some of the LNG facilities that are going to be built to increase LNG production and then export out of the U.S. into other parts of the world. If you follow Qatar as a country, they issue a significant or they signed significant agreements with some of the major international oil companies for shared production agreements between their gas production as well, that all eventually flows through our customers starting with the EMCs and eventually facilities that are running that, then they will have a chance to optimize their operations and include their reliability. And eventually we also hope to be getting them excited about employing some of the microgrid technology capabilities from our side. So, overall, we just see a good environment and one that is driven by multiple factors that are benefiting that.\nMatt Pfau: Great. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, thank you, Matt.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question, please. And our next question comes from Rob Oliver from Baird. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Rob.\nRob Oliver: Hi, Antonio. Hi, Chantelle. Thank you guys for taking my questions. I\u2019m in a loud spot, so I want to put them both out there and then mute. So Antonio just following up on Matt\u2019s question, just regarding the macro, appreciate your commentary. It sounds like the only change or modest change that from your prepared remarks was around chemicals where there\u2019s some uncertainty there and you mentioned supply and demand issues and stuff like that. Can you talk a little bit about how that then is factored into that wide range of outcomes, meaning are you seeing strength in other areas that are potentially making up for that in driving the ACV? And then, the second question, which was my follow-up, was just around your comments relative to strength and upstream. Really interesting, and I think you alluded to a combo core Aspen SSE deal, if I heard that right, and I apologize because the audio wasn\u2019t great for me. But if so, can you talk a little bit about that? Are those deals happening right now? What the pipeline looks for that and what the kind of increase in deal sizing opportunity looks versus what you saw for core Aspen? Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, well, I mean, let me clarify as well regarding the first part of your question. Rob, I mean, chemical companies reported in their second calendar quarter results meaning the June quarter record profitability and record revenue. Now what we\u2019re seeing here in the September quarter results that are coming down from that record profitability and record revenue to perhaps profitability more in line with their historical performance. But nonetheless, if not what it was back in June. So, while we\u2019re keeping an eye on this our chemicals business performed well in our Q1 fiscal quarter. We \u2013 it\u2019s a change and therefore we\u2019re monitoring to see, we detect any behavior change from this customers. But so far, so good. Look, if there were to be a deterioration, if there\u2019s one, it\u2019s something that we have accounted for in that range, as you said. I mean, and what other puts and takes, well, you said it. We believe that the combination of AspenTech, heritage AspenTech engineering suite with SSEs subsurface times and engineering suite is a great, great new offering for our customers. Customers get excited about the potential to optimize their operations, both combining the subsurface and above surface facilities. And this is leading to not only great conversations, but a completely different perspective about the new AspenTech from these customers for the top relationship that they want to have with us going forward, which is changing the conversations completely. So we\u2019re optimistic that the SSE business could have the potential for overperformance in fiscal 2023. It\u2019s early days, but based on the conversations in this first quarter again, just as a degree of optimism.\nRob Oliver: Great. Thank you guys very much.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, Rob.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nAndrew Obin: Hey guys. Good afternoon.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Andrew.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Obin: Just want to ask a question about the sort of the inmation acquisition because I think it\u2019s actually very interesting, it goes to the heart of your working closer with Emerson, right? Because I think, I believe Emerson built their platform based on sort of data capabilities based on that, right? And you had a competing product and now you\u2019re effectively taking over that sort of rationalizing, I think the two approaches. Can you just expand on that and just maybe talk about where you see more opportunities to sort of rationalize the approaches between the two companies in terms of technology? Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, so, and Andrew, you\u2019re exactly right. Emerson was an early investor in inmation. They invested in inmation in 2020. And you\u2019re starting to see some of the benefits of the relationship between Emerson and Aspen Technology. Emerson highlighted to us \u2013 what they thought was a strength of inmation and why we should be interested in inmation. After doing diligence and doing our own assessment of the capabilities of inmation, we felt that their technology would be a step change in our capabilities. And now while we closed the transaction. What I can tell you though is and the rationale for why we thinking inmation is so important. And the fact is that over the last 12, 18 months as we\u2019ve reengaged with customers in person more and more customers are telling us that was now they have all their data in these massive data lays that are being created by the cloud services companies. They have a real difficulty making sense of all this data related this data to each other. And therefore, they're asking for help in that regard. And this is exactly what inmation does. Inmation brings order to data, we contextualize the data. It creates data relationships. And as such, customers that deploy inmation will be able to then explore the latent value that exist in the data by using that data on in applications or other use cases, for example, with AspenTech applications capabilities, so we're very excited about this. It's going to become the cornerstone of our AIoT business. And now, well, now that AspenTech bounced in a way, Emerson has increased its investment in inmation because they own 55% of Aspen Technology by their name. The patients now in AspenTech, and this is now the two companies are going to be basically the data foundation for our customers going forward. The other areas where there will be opportunities, certainly in the control, advanced process control area, historian and other opportunities, but this is all areas that we still have to explore with Emerson. But this is going to be part of that commercial relationship that Emerson and AspenTech has established. That also has to be vetted by related public transactions were needed to mature that is properly done at an arm's length of that relationship. So we're very excited. And this is the first step in perhaps many of these types of relations going forward.\nAndrew Obin: Congratulations and thank you for a great answer. Thanks a lot.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you for your question. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Jason.\nJason Celino: Hi, Antonio. Hi, Chantelle. Good afternoon. Maybe my first one, I understand that Q1 is typically a lower sequential growth quarter as been always like that. Maybe why did ACV and particularly, the heritage annual spend metric, it was kind of flat, decelerated just a hair, but anything to call out on that?\nAntonio Pietri: Let me give you an answer and then Chantelle can follow up. So just look at the two months of our lowest growth quarters, typically and that is the case. We're happy with our performance in Q1. Chantelle highlighted in his prepared remarks, that we had a transaction in Russia that we had to write-off because eventually didn't need the requirements under the tensions structure that exists or framework that exists with some Russian companies and that impacted the net growth in ACV that we deliver. But otherwise, we would have been [Technical Difficulty].\nJason Celino: Great. And then when we think about acquisitions, so inmation, it's interesting that lead came from Emerson and obviously, we have Micromine. But \u2013 how should we think about the pace of your acquisitions going forward? And then maybe how you intend to fund them if you do see a pickup? Thanks.\nAntonio Pietri: Well, let me look, we certainly also want to be judicious on the M&A front with regard to how much we've taken on with \u2013 I consider the first July and August to have been months of a lot of work. It required a lot of, if you will, activation energy to put in place everything that we talked about in the prepared remarks so that we can execute the rest of this fiscal year and beyond. So I would say we were through the bulk of not only integration, board also sort of the transformation infrastructure that we needed to put in place to be successful going forward with SSE and OSI. We are patiently waiting for the Micromine transaction to close that a well-run business has been run by private equity for almost four years, high profitability, high growth. So there's no little transformation that has to be done there. It's only about immigration. And inmation, it's a small company. I also believe that if you want to be judicious about M&A, you do acquisitions when they're available. And that availability will be say our next move from an M&A standpoint. But we're making good progress with we built an organization that is focused on dividends and integration of acquisitions that is performing incredibly well. So I believe that we've grown a new muscle in the company around diligence and integration of these acquisitions that we didn't have two years ago, and that is a muscle that will rely on going forward.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. I think the other thing I'd add, Jason, just to kind of give you is we're in a comfortable zone on what the activity we are doing. And each of them have their own flavor to it for their own disposes. So like Antonio mentioned, the Emerson owners have seven months. We have integration. We had to hit the ground running. We had the muscle number built in the IMO team when we have. If you look at inmation, it's a horizon to play more of a tuck-in. And then Micromine is almost like its own standalone business starts funding. So I think that the difference in a variety of them also complement that it's a doable venture that we wonder look at Jason versus all the same, including strain on the same board in the same team in the organization. So I think that's another way to look at it.\nJason Celino: No, that\u2019s actually quite helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Clarke Jeffries from KeyBanc Capital Markets. I apologize about that. Your line is now open.\nClarke Jeffries: Hello, thank you for taking the question. First question is just Antonio, how optimistic are you about the profitability and demand environment for the refining industry? And maybe specifically LNG, lots of headlines around reaching kind of peak storage capacity in the EU right now. Any signs that you're seeing in terms of potential cuts to OpEx budgets? Or do you see the current levels as still elevated enough to facilitate those final investment decisions for those export facilities or any other business related to LNG that you have?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, let me first address LNG start and then I'll talk about refining. Look, the fact is that when these customers, operators making the final investment decision, they're making an investment decision for a 20, 30 year time frame. And the outlook for the use of LNG as a source of energy so these fluctuations \u2013 short-term fluctuations, I don't think they're going to change anything. The fact is that gas is considered will be a transition fuel for net-zero carbon emission ambitions. And the demand profile is there to support that greater investment that's gone into the ground to build this asset. So I don't think any of these changes for the storage is filled on out in Europe. With respect to refining, look, the fact is that refiners are feeling very bullish. I had the opportunity to meet over the weekend an individual in the trading function of an independent refining company. And I was actually surprised of how optimistic this person felt about their margins going forward because return only now that jet fuel demand is starting to come back, but this individual was also incredibly excited about diesel demand coming back, and these are two things that have been missing over the last 12 months. So this individual was not only optimistic about it today, but even the next six to 12 months. So I think \u2013 and it\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing from refiners. Good solid continued spend on our technologies.\nClarke Jeffries: All right. A little bit of technical difficulties there. But a follow-up question is just on the pace of migration for SSE and DGM. I mean, certainly encouraging to see the SSE suite launched and DGM coming in the second half. Were those time lines ahead of schedule or roughly what you expected when you set out with guidance? And any incremental confidence you have in the ACV growth in those segments for the rest of the year either off of benefits to attrition or kind of the net new funnel here?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. I believe [indiscernible] R&D organizations in the software industry, and they perform accordingly. So they were ahead of plan on the release of the SSE suite for Windows. I hope they achieve the same feed for the Venus version and the DGM suite because that will help us with our trajectory. Those transformations are hard, and you have to build momentum in the transformation because there\u2019s a lot of sort of infrastructure we have to put in place systems, processes best practices organizations. And we\u2019ve done a lot of that now in the Q1 quarter. I believe we\u2019ve built momentum, and we\u2019ll continue to build momentum in Q2. And that\u2019s why in the prepared remarks, we stated that we expect a lot of the transformation benefits to start showing off \u2013 to really show off in Q3, Q4. And look, from my own assessment, I do believe that our year will come together beautifully in the Q3, Q4 for quarters in the first half of next calender year.\nClarke Jeffries: Perfect. Thank you very much for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question please. And our next question comes from Mark Schappel from Loop Capital. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Mark.\nMark Schappel: Hi, Antonio. Hi, Chantelle. Antonio, I just want to go back to your comments around the chemical industry and just to make sure I understand that correctly. Are you actually seeing usage or buying hesitation from these customers? Or are you just raising a few red flags, given the recent profit warnings from some of the members in the sector?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Just the latter. We didn\u2019t see any behavior change from chemical customers if you want. We just want to acknowledge that we\u2019re seeing this dynamic. And like I said, they\u2019re just coming down from record profitability and revenue in the quarter to quarter, something more normal, but nonetheless, it\u2019s a change, and we just want to highlight that to all of you.\nMark Schappel: Helpful. Thank you. And then talk a little bit about the APM suite. Maybe just give us a little bit of an update in terms of any new pilots or customer wins that are worth mentioning?\nAntonio Pietri: Look, so we keep our update for APM to the half year. So we do that in the January call. But Look, we continue to gain traction. I do think the market has sort of unfrozen from the pandemic period. We\u2019re seeing a lot more engagement with customers. We are seeing also bigger deals in the pipeline and more interest. I also think that customers after two, three years of trying to figure out what everything that they were being told by all these suppliers of technology and that they\u2019re sort of cutting through the noise and focusing on those technologies and capabilities that they think will help. And I\u2019d like to think that AspenTech in that category.\nMark Schappel: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Hi, Antonio. Hi, Chantelle. Thanks for taking the question. And so just a few quarters into working with Emerson software assets, what are the key impressions and what has maybe surprised you most as far? Thanks so much.\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I\u2019ll give you my impression and Chantelle give you hers. Look, first of all, when I first met with Lal Karsanbhai, one of my key ask was the oil side business, because I felt they had the potential to truly become a technology leader in the utilities industry. And basically, the last four, five months have only corroborated my \u2013 what I thought was the case. They have great technology. Their customers love their technology and what they do for them, and now with the scale of the new AspenTech and our channel to market on a global basis because they\u2019re a very North American-focused company, we\u2019ll be able to accelerate their expansion into international markets. So very excited about that. Look, it\u2019s been a great presence of price as well. They have unbelievable technology. We\u2019re going to be investing in that technology to accelerate some of their innovation. But more instantly, the whole perception of SSE by customers has changed now in their partnership and ownership by AspenTech. Again, back to this opportunity to optimize subsurface and above surface facilities, AspenTech\u2019s on capabilities in software and how we can contribute to SSE and SSE\u2019s expertise in upstream and now AspenTech being really the only company in the market that can model the entire petroleum supply chain from the rock to the corner gas station is a very unique capability. I started having meetings with customers immediately after we close the transaction and have been so excited about what I\u2019m hearing from this customer. So I\u2019m very optimistic. I love the fact that we own these businesses. And they totally reposition that and help us reposition usability, CCS, geothermal energy, electrification with our own capabilities around efficiency and clarity so really from a strong sustainability position going forward.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. I think the things I would only add to what Antonio mentioned I agree with those. I would say for the overall, I\u2019m completely energized by the enthusiasm to lean into the synergies that we have together. So I think that\u2019s fantastic. I think for the OSI, DGM, I think that the team realizing the tremendous opportunity to digitalize that industry, the transmission distribution industry is very encouraging. I think for the SSE side, having the team jump in with the token that\u2019s now available for Windows and Linux coming. We believe that to take that and run with it in the first quarter. It was very impressive. So I think this really good data points in the first quarter is very encouraging.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And thank you. And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Antonio Pietri, CEO, for closing remarks.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, Justin, and thanks, everyone, for joining what is the first earnings call of the new AspenTech. We look forward to engaging with all of you on the road here in the next few weeks and months. Thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Chantelle Breithaupt",
            "content": "Thank you, Antonio. I will now review our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. As a reminder, these results are being reported under Topic 606, which has a material impact on both the timing and method of our revenue recognition for our term license contracts. Our license revenue is heavily impacted by the timing of booking and more specifically renewal booking. A decrease or increase in bookings between fiscal periods resulting from a change in the amount of term license contracts up for renewal is not an indicator of the health or growth of our business. The timing of renewals is not linear between quarters or fiscal years and this nonlinearity will have a significant impact on the timing of our revenue. As a reminder, we have transitioned from annual spend to ACV, annual contract value, as our primary growth metric. We define ACV as an estimate of the annual value of our portfolio of term license and term and perpetual software maintenance and support or SMS agreement. ACV provides insight into our annual growth and retention of our recurring revenue base, which is the majority of our overall revenue as well as recurring cash flow. Annual contract value was $809.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, up 7.7% year-over-year. This includes approximately $2.7 million of contribution from the recently acquired business of inmation. Please also note that we booked a $1.7 million reduction in ACV during this quarter due to a Russia sanction related write off. As Antonio mentioned, while we work through the transition of the DGM portfolio to term licenses, orders from this business are not included in ACV when signed due to the lack of separability from the AspenTech provided services. We expect DGM to contribute more meaningfully to ACV in the second half of this fiscal year after we achieve separability. Annual spend for heritage AspenTech, which the company defines as the annualized value of all term license and maintenance contracts at the end of the quarter for the businesses other than OSI and SSE was approximately $682.3 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which increased 8.3% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and 1.2% subsequently. This includes approximately $1.6 million of contribution from inmation. As a reminder, we intend to provide this disclosure on annual spend for heritage AspenTech only for fiscal 2023 to provide investors comparability with our historical disclosures. Total bookings, which we define as the total value of customer term license and perpetual SMS contract signs in the current period left the value of term license and perpetual SMS contract signed in the current period, but where the initial licenses are not yet being delivered under Topic 606. Plus term license and perpetual SMS contracts signed in the previous period for which the initial licenses are deem delivered in the current period was $224 million, a 43% increase year-over-year. Total revenue was $250.8 million for the first quarter. As a reminder, as a result of the Emerson transaction, the subsidiary that included the DGM and SSE businesses became the surviving entity. As a result, the year ago comparisons you see in our financial statements only include DGM and SSE in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, and year-over-year comparisons are not meaningful. Turning to profitability beginning on a GAAP basis. operating expenses for the quarter were $210.9 million. Total expenses including cost of revenue were $302 million. Operating loss was $51.2 million and net loss for a quarter was $11.2 million or $0.17 per share. The net loss reflects the non-cash expense recognized for the mark-to-market adjustment for an Australia dollar foreign currency derivative related to the announced Micromine acquisition. This will continue to fluctuate until the closing of the transaction. Turning to non-GAAP results, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of the tangibles associated with acquisitions and acquisition related fees, and excluding the impact of the unrealized loss on the foreign currency derivative, we reported non-GAAP operating income for the first quarter of $92.6 million, representing a 36.9% non-GAAP operating margin. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period to period due to the timing of customer renewals and therefore license revenue recognized during the quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $142 million or $2.20 per share based on 64.5 million shares outstanding. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with approximately $382.5 million of cash and cash equivalent and $270 million outstanding under our credit facility. During the quarter, we spend approximately $75 million for the acquisition of inmation. As Antonio highlighted. We are excited to bring inmation together with AspenTech and believe it is a great example of the opportunity we have to expand our product portfolio and increase the value we deliver for customers via acquisitions. From a financial perspective, inmation is expected to be immaterial in fiscal 2023 from a revenue of profitability and ACV contribution perspective. In the first quarter, we generated $5.1 million of cash from operations and $10.7 million of free cash flow after taking into consideration the net impact of capital expenditures, capitalized software and excluding acquisition and integration planning related payments. As a reminder, the first quarter is typically our lowest cash flow quarter due primarily to the seasonality of cash collection. I would now like to close with guidance. We have gotten off to a strong start in fiscal 2023 and we see positive underlying demand trends across the business. Our outlook for fiscal 2023 reflects these trends while also considering a wider range of potential outcomes to reflect the growing uncertainty in the economy. And finish with the progress that we have made on our integration initiatives during the quarter. We believe we are well positioned for the long term from a growth and profitability perspective and our ability to realize the $110 million of adjusted EBITDA synergy by 2026. With respect to ACV, we are maintaining a target of 10.5% to 13.5% growth for the year, including four points of growth contribution from the DGM and SSE product portfolios. The spending environment remains favorable overall and we believe we on track to drive greater contribution from the DGM and SSE portfolios in the second half of the year. We are maintaining our bookings in the range of $1.07 billion to $1.17 billion, which includes $547 million of contracts that are up for renewal in fiscal 2023. This includes approximately $111 million of contract up for renewal in the second quarter. We continue to expect revenue in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.2 billion. We expect license revenue in the range of $765 million to $826 million and maintenance revenue and service and other revenue of approximately $312 million and $64 million, respectively. From an expense perspective, we expect total GAAP expenses of $1.197 to $1.207 billion, but increased expense outlook is related to acquisition, integration planning, and amortization of purchase and tangible expenses associated with inmation acquisition. Taking together, we expect GAAP operating loss in a range of $57 million to $5 million for fiscal 2023 with GAAP net loss in the range of $32.5 million to $22.5 million. We expect GAAP net loss per share to in the range of $0.49 to $0.34. From a non-GAAP perspective, we expect operating income of $503 million to $555 million and non-GAAP income per share in the range of $6.76 to $6.91. From a free cash flow perspective, we continue to expect free cash flow of $347 to $362 million. Our fiscal 2023 free cash flow guidance assumes cash tax payments in the range of $94 million to $104 million, which is unchanged. To wrap up, AspenTech is off to a strong start in fiscal 2023. We are successfully executing on our integration plan and have set the foundation to deliver on our near and long-term financial objectives. We believe we are uniquely positioned to create even greater value for our customers and shareholders over the long term and our keenly focused on maximizing the opportunity. With that operator, let's begin with Q&A. Hi, Andrew. Yes. I think the other thing I'd add, Jason, just to kind of give you is we're in a comfortable zone on what the activity we are doing. And each of them have their own flavor to it for their own disposes. So like Antonio mentioned, the Emerson owners have seven months. We have integration. We had to hit the ground running. We had the muscle number built in the IMO team when we have. If you look at inmation, it's a horizon to play more of a tuck-in. And then Micromine is almost like its own standalone business starts funding. So I think that the difference in a variety of them also complement that it's a doable venture that we wonder look at Jason versus all the same, including strain on the same board in the same team in the organization. So I think that's another way to look at it. Yes. I think the things I would only add to what Antonio mentioned I agree with those. I would say for the overall, I'm completely energized by the enthusiasm to lean into the synergies that we have together. So I think that's fantastic. I think for the OSI, DGM, I think that the team realizing the tremendous opportunity to digitalize that industry, the transmission distribution industry is very encouraging. I think for the SSE side, having the team jump in with the token that's now available for Windows and Linux coming. We believe that to take that and run with it in the first quarter. It was very impressive. So I think this really good data points in the first quarter is very encouraging."

            "name": "Antonio Pietri",
            "content": "Thanks Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our first fiscal quarter performance was in line with our expectations. This was an important quarter since the completion of the Emerson transaction. [Technical Difficulty] business currently on the steps of the performance on OSI and SSE businesses. We entered the fiscal year with a clear focus to execute on our integration plan after the 7.5 months of [Technical Difficulty] completed before the close of the transaction on May 16. During the quarter, we validated many of our expectations from the integration planning phase, but also learn of additional process improvements and potential synergies. We also put new processes and systems in place to support the transformation efforts that will deliver the significant growth and profitability expectations we have for the business in the coming quarters and years. Some of these include successfully validated the token licensing model and designing the suite for SSE, which was released last week for Windows. The strong release time line was achieved through the focus effort by our software development and product management teams. The SSE suite has quickly been embraced by customers that we have engaged with in these discussions. This is the first step in the transformation of the SSE business and a clear demonstration of the learnings and expertise gains from our own transformation in the 2009 to 2014 period. As we have experienced, when heritage AspenTech introduced the token licensing model for the engineering and MSC suites, customers quickly recognize that by providing the entire portfolio of products in a single suite, it is much easier to try new products and accelerate adoption under a token licensing model. We expect the latest version of the ASPEN-1 SSE suite to be released in the near future as the final component of the tokenization of the SSE product portfolio. Second, we began the process of migrating the DGM or dealer grid management product portfolio to a term contract structure with the ultimate objective being the introduction of the token licensing model and DGM Suite, which is expected to happen in the second half of this fiscal year. As a reminder, the DGM product portfolio has been historically a perpetual license business. So there is a significant transition for existing customers that needs to occur to get them onto the token licensing model while we will live with the suite and tokens when engaging new customers. The introduction of the DGM suite will also enable the cross-selling opportunity of DGM products into heritage AspenTech market where customers are accustomed to this licensing model. Third, we have signed and been awarded multiple commercial agreements for DGM products that will be implemented solely by third parties to demonstrate separability of software licenses and services. Achieving separability will result in an earlier inclusion of software licenses to ACV. Today, software licenses in the DGM business are recognized on a percent of completion basis during projects since these are considered bundled. Therefore, DGM transactions are currently not included in ACV when signed. We aim to achieve this separability within the second half of fiscal year 2023. Fourth, we have successfully onboarded and aligned the sales teams from OSI and SSE, including establishing a common sales and forecast methodology, refining territories and accounts ownership standardizing quota and commission structure and establishing cross-sell procedures. Ensuring alignment across the sales organization and the entire company is critical, and we're pleased with how we have come together throughout the first quarter. And last, we have established a commercial organization that will support Emerson's go-to-market teams in the varied territories identified for them to resell our products. Emerson has also established [indiscernible] with AspenTech product quarters that will be compensated for Siemens. Overall, we cannot be more pleased with the progress made in the partnership. In regards to the synergies expected from the transaction, we expect to deliver synergies in four areas: growth, business transformation, costs and commercial agreements. Each of the synergy streams are now broken down into sub-streams with clear team and individual accountability for each. Overall, we are pleased with the progress made in the first quarter in each sub-stream to put us on the trajectory to meet or exceeded. We have made great progress on the cost synergies already capturing a significant percentage of them. We expect to begin generating synergies in the three other areas in the second half of this fiscal year. We've been confident about our ability to deliver on the synergies. And as mentioned before, we have also identified other potential areas of opportunities. I'm very proud of the performance of the team in the first quarter. We successfully laid the foundation to set us in the right trajectory to achieve our fiscal year 2023 and longer term objectives. Now turning to our first quarter financial results. Annual contract value or ACV was $809.6 million, up 7.7% year-over-year. Revenue was $250.8 million. GAAP loss per share was $0.17 and non-GAAP EPS was $2.20 and free cash flow was $10.7 million. Additionally, we're sharing the following information to provide you with visibility into the early transformation momentum created with the DGM and SSE product portfolios in the quarter. The DGM product portfolio generated $16.9 million in software license orders not accounted for ACV results. $5.5 million, of which were term agreements and the rest perpetual. While the term licenses cannot be included in ACV when signed due to the bundled arrangement nature of the transaction, this outcome demonstrates our ability to introduce term licensing to OSI customers. We're very happy with this outcome right out of the gate, considering that it was the first full quarter since the transaction closed. For the SSE product portfolio, we saw the start of the transformation of the commercial relationship with customers. Some customers with agreements up for renewal accept the new terms of conditions typical of heritage AspenTech software agreements converted from perpetual to term license agreements and/or, in some cases, extended the term of their agreements. An example of the change in the commercial relationship with customers is the agreement with an international oil company based in the Asia-Pacific region that consolidated a legacy perpetual license agreement and multiple older contracts into one contract at a time of renewal of one of their existing agreements, signing up for a three-year term with significant growth all due to the newly perceived value in the relationship with AspenTech. Again, this is a narrow demonstration of the value creation opportunities we have with these new businesses and the changes we're making in how we will approach customer relationships. Now moving on to the macro environment. Overall, demand trends were similar to what we have seen in recent quarters. While we remain vigilant about the uncertain economic backdrop, fundamentals in each of our core end markets remains constructive. We continue to see strong deal activity across each of our key end markets and in each region around the world. Our customers recognize that the dual challenge of meeting the rising demand for resources globally with the urgent need to meaningfully reduce environmental impact will be the key strategic priority facing their businesses for many years to come. Mainly, to meet this objective will result in an increasingly difficult regulatory environment that may eventually challenge their license to operate from society. At large, meeting the dual challenge will require rethinking how our customers design and operate their assets, including their reliance on electrical power from renewables. This in turn will drive a significant investment in technologies to modernize the electrical grid, capture and sequester carbon in industrial parts and scale new energy sources, such as hydrogen, which we believe will all ultimately benefit AspenTech's business in meaningful ways and make us an increasingly strategic partner to them. As we have also seen in recent months, energy security has become a critically importantly strategic concern. It is spurring substantial new demand in areas like LNG and more broadly reinforces the fact that many of the traditional sources of energy will remain essential to securing a steady and secure flow of affordable energy for the foreseeable future. The breadth and depth of AspenTech's product portfolio and our decades of experience in this market also puts us in a unique position to benefit from these trends. I would now like to provide some more color on our performance by vertical. Refining had a solid start to the year. Demand for refined products remains strong and refiners settled into a more normalized profitability profile in the quarter following the record crack spreads earlier this year. Increase in diesel and jet fuel demand is expected to continue to climb over the next 12 months, providing greater support for improved financial performance for this quarter. Refining has long been a source of strength for AspenTech, and we believe this industry segment will continue to be well positioned in the remainder of fiscal year 2023. The upstream vertical is now a more meaningful contributor to AspenTech and had a strong quarter as we saw exciting initial demand for our SSE products. Customer feedback has been fantastic on the value of bringing together AspenTech's engineering solutions with SSE's capabilities in areas like subsurface modeling and carbon capture. Having a product portfolio that supports the entire life cycle of upstream operations is unprecedented and solidifies our leadership in this market. We believe there is significant upside potential in the coming years in the upstream market for the SSE suite as oil and gas companies increase CapEx budgets after several years of underinvestment. And the opportunities from the carbon capture and sequestration or CCS and geothermal energy become more prevalent. We also get off to a great start in the power transmission and distribution market or T&D, generating new momentum with DGM after the two-year ownership transition process for the OSI business. The scale of investment immediately decree in the coming years to support increased electricity demand and the complexity introduced by renewable sources of power, like wind, solar and hydro at large. We signed a number of important wins in DGM during the quarter, including the first multimillion dollar term license order in that business. We are very pleased with how the pipeline for this business is building and the breadth of customer conversations we're having. We believe this recognize that they will need much more sophisticated technology across their operations to manage the growing complexity of power transmission and distribution. And while it is early, we are having exciting conversations with some of our energy and clinical customers about the potential benefits of micro grids to their business. This opportunity will take time to play out, and we believe it will be significant. Chemicals had a good quarter, and we have been very pleased with how customers in this market have embraced the need to increase investments to meet the dual challenge, which for them, also includes plastics circular. In the near term, this market, particularly in Europe, will need to work through the challenges related to the energy supply disruptions from a cost and demand perspective. This is a situation that we're monitoring closely and is probably the biggest area of uncertainty in our business currently. However, in the past, we have overseen that these types of situations has benefited AspenTech as it becomes an even bigger imperative to run a petrochemical plant as efficiently as possible. Finally, we're pleased with the trends in the E&C vertical. As we have discussed in recent calls, the need for sustainability is opening up new business opportunities for E&C, which is helping to strengthen and diversify their business. For example, in 2021, over 100 CCS or carbon capture and sequestration facilities were announced. Traditional oil and gas CapEx investment is also growing meaningfully after several years of underinvestment during the pandemic. The net result of all of this is a vertical that is as well positioned as it has been in years to generate consistent growth for AspenTech. The macro environment referenced above, supported the performance of the heritage AspenTech suite in line with our expectations. As a reference, following the three agreements signed in the quarter, all of the three agreements signed in the quarter. First, one of the largest public utility companies in the United States and a decade-long customer of OSI committed to the implementation of two large scaler systems for advanced distribution management or ADMS and distributed energy management or DEM capability. We were selected following a highly competitive sales process in which they evaluated technologies from multiple competitors. This win expand the deployment of ADM solutions to its distribution and outage management business from its existing deployment in its transmission business. This expanded agreement is an important step forward in the customers' efforts to invest in its regulated businesses, accelerate its carbon reduction targets and streamline the [indiscernible] value for customers, communities and investors. I would note that we were able to successfully transition the sales process to a business contract after starting as a [indiscernible] prior to the completion of the Emerson transaction. Second, a state-owned oil company in one of the major oil-producing countries in the Eurasia region, signed a new five-year agreement using AspenTech's customary return for a range of products in the SSE portfolio. [indiscernible] as this has been a former SSE customer who has expired long ago and decided to return in part due to the broader product portfolio and vision of the new AspenTech. This new agreement sets the relationship for further expansion in the use of SSE products. And third and final, an international company and long-time AspenTech engineering suite customer expanded its total spend commitment for the third time since the renewal of the agreement in fiscal 2021 and has now increased its total spend by more than 40% in two years. This amendment increases software access to their gas business for use of the integrated front-end engineering design capabilities, including the Aspen OptiPlant product. There are many more initiatives being pursued with this customer for further expansion in the use of AspenTech products. From an innovation perspective, we have finalized a whole conversion for in aspenONE, which we will release for general availability soon, and where our continued investment in sustainability will be further demonstrated with many new application moments. Meeting the dual challenge will also require co-innovation and partnering by customers and suppliers of technology. We now have a dedicated team co-innovating with our customers where one of the most interesting developments in the partnership group, we have established to develop a solution to record, report and manage the potential CO2 emissions by leveraging several of our products. This is a great indication of the increasingly important role AspenTech is playing with our customers in the sustainability space. We will also be hosting open forum, our global conference for the Power T&D industry for users of the DGM product portfolio in Las Vegas in early December. This is an exciting opportunity for the new AspenTech to establish our vision and direction for this industry and engage with this customer growth to introduce them to the capabilities of the new company. Finally, we continue to execute on our M&A strategy. During the quarter, we acquired Inmation, a market leader in industrial real-time information management. Inmation adapts to the needs of its customers by connecting an organization's industrial data from various data sources from client-level histories to enterprise systems to create a real-time industrial data infrastructure. We will combine this capability with AspenTech's existing portfolio of plant level solutions and AI capabilities to create a unique enterprise-wide data infrastructure. We will make Inmation the cornerstone of our AIoT industrial data and connectivity business. In addition, we continue to make progress in integration planning for Micromine and are having positive conversations on how to capitalize on the opportunity in the metals and mining market. We expect the transaction will close late in our second fiscal quarter subject to regulatory approvals. I would like to wrap up with some quick thoughts business dynamics and our outlook for fiscal year 2023. We are tracking well against our full year ACV growth target of 10.5% to 13.5%, including 4 points of contribution from DGM and SSE as well as against our free cash flow guidance. As we have indicated previously, historically, the second half of the fiscal year is much stronger for heritage AspenTech. We expect the growth and synergies from DGM and SSE to begin materializing in earnest in the second half of the fiscal year considering the sales cycle for the pipeline of these products and the time required to evolve the commercial relationship with customers. We also want to reiterate that expanding trends and opportunity dynamics in the first of the fiscal year remain positive, reflecting customers calendar year 2022 budgets. As we approach the second half of the fiscal year, today, we remain optimistic that customer budgets for calendar 2023 will be supported. Anecdotally, we heard positive feedback from customer oil and gas CapEx budgets for next year. Also, please recall that budgets in the power T&D markets are typically regulated, so there's a good deal of disability in that market. While our customers businesses have continued to do well, we recognized that they face a number of potential challenges, particularly in the chemicals market in the near term. As a reminder, our guidance range was intentionally set wider than normal to account for a range of outcomes that also include geopolitical considerations. We believe that was prudent back in August and we continue to think is the right approach. Let me wrap up by saying how please I am with the progress we made in the first quarter, the hard work by everyone at new AspenTech to bring together these three businesses in such a short time has been a great success. We have set a stage to deliver on the growth and financial objectives we have guided to for fiscal year 2023 and beyond. With that, let me turn the call over to Chantelle. Chantelle? Hi, Matt. Oh, let me look at like we said in our prepared remarks, Matt, today, we see a solid micro environment out there for our customers or prices have remained in a very good range for these customers. The industry continues to execute on what our CapEx budgets resulting from investment approved for them by local governments and other type of entities. And as we said, it's only chemicals, especially European companies where we're seeing at degradation of the performance around revenue growth and margin. But we've also seen that sort of situation before where these customers also decide to invest more on technology to drive greater efficiencies to try to overcome the marketing degradation. So overall, today, we feel like the macro environment has remained and will remain through the remainder of this calendar year. And so far what we've heard anecdotally is that budgets will still be solid for calendar year 2023. The refining industry, if anything continues to improve their performance, if you look at the results announced by some of the independent refiners here in the U.S., incredible results. So overall, we've been good about the outlook as of today. Yes, no, look, I think some of that is already playing out through a final investment decisions around some of the LNG facilities that are going to be built to increase LNG production and then export out of the U.S. into other parts of the world. If you follow Qatar as a country, they issue a significant or they signed significant agreements with some of the major international oil companies for shared production agreements between their gas production as well, that all eventually flows through our customers starting with the EMCs and eventually facilities that are running that, then they will have a chance to optimize their operations and include their reliability. And eventually we also hope to be getting them excited about employing some of the microgrid technology capabilities from our side. So, overall, we just see a good environment and one that is driven by multiple factors that are benefiting that. Yes, thank you, Matt. Hi, Rob. Yes, well, I mean, let me clarify as well regarding the first part of your question. Rob, I mean, chemical companies reported in their second calendar quarter results meaning the June quarter record profitability and record revenue. Now what we're seeing here in the September quarter results that are coming down from that record profitability and record revenue to perhaps profitability more in line with their historical performance. But nonetheless, if not what it was back in June. So, while we're keeping an eye on this our chemicals business performed well in our Q1 fiscal quarter. We \u2013 it's a change and therefore we're monitoring to see, we detect any behavior change from this customers. But so far, so good. Look, if there were to be a deterioration, if there's one, it's something that we have accounted for in that range, as you said. I mean, and what other puts and takes, well, you said it. We believe that the combination of AspenTech, heritage AspenTech engineering suite with SSEs subsurface times and engineering suite is a great, great new offering for our customers. Customers get excited about the potential to optimize their operations, both combining the subsurface and above surface facilities. And this is leading to not only great conversations, but a completely different perspective about the new AspenTech from these customers for the top relationship that they want to have with us going forward, which is changing the conversations completely. So we're optimistic that the SSE business could have the potential for overperformance in fiscal 2023. It's early days, but based on the conversations in this first quarter again, just as a degree of optimism. Thank you, Rob. Hi, Andrew. Yes, so, and Andrew, you're exactly right. Emerson was an early investor in inmation. They invested in inmation in 2020. And you're starting to see some of the benefits of the relationship between Emerson and Aspen Technology. Emerson highlighted to us \u2013 what they thought was a strength of inmation and why we should be interested in inmation. After doing diligence and doing our own assessment of the capabilities of inmation, we felt that their technology would be a step change in our capabilities. And now while we closed the transaction. What I can tell you though is and the rationale for why we thinking inmation is so important. And the fact is that over the last 12, 18 months as we've reengaged with customers in person more and more customers are telling us that was now they have all their data in these massive data lays that are being created by the cloud services companies. They have a real difficulty making sense of all this data related this data to each other. And therefore, they're asking for help in that regard. And this is exactly what inmation does. Inmation brings order to data, we contextualize the data. It creates data relationships. And as such, customers that deploy inmation will be able to then explore the latent value that exist in the data by using that data on in applications or other use cases, for example, with AspenTech applications capabilities, so we're very excited about this. It's going to become the cornerstone of our AIoT business. And now, well, now that AspenTech bounced in a way, Emerson has increased its investment in inmation because they own 55% of Aspen Technology by their name. The patients now in AspenTech, and this is now the two companies are going to be basically the data foundation for our customers going forward. The other areas where there will be opportunities, certainly in the control, advanced process control area, historian and other opportunities, but this is all areas that we still have to explore with Emerson. But this is going to be part of that commercial relationship that Emerson and AspenTech has established. That also has to be vetted by related public transactions were needed to mature that is properly done at an arm's length of that relationship. So we're very excited. And this is the first step in perhaps many of these types of relations going forward. Thank you. Hi, Jason. Let me give you an answer and then Chantelle can follow up. So just look at the two months of our lowest growth quarters, typically and that is the case. We're happy with our performance in Q1. Chantelle highlighted in his prepared remarks, that we had a transaction in Russia that we had to write-off because eventually didn't need the requirements under the tensions structure that exists or framework that exists with some Russian companies and that impacted the net growth in ACV that we deliver. But otherwise, we would have been [Technical Difficulty]. Well, let me look, we certainly also want to be judicious on the M&A front with regard to how much we've taken on with \u2013 I consider the first July and August to have been months of a lot of work. It required a lot of, if you will, activation energy to put in place everything that we talked about in the prepared remarks so that we can execute the rest of this fiscal year and beyond. So I would say we were through the bulk of not only integration, board also sort of the transformation infrastructure that we needed to put in place to be successful going forward with SSE and OSI. We are patiently waiting for the Micromine transaction to close that a well-run business has been run by private equity for almost four years, high profitability, high growth. So there's no little transformation that has to be done there. It's only about immigration. And inmation, it's a small company. I also believe that if you want to be judicious about M&A, you do acquisitions when they're available. And that availability will be say our next move from an M&A standpoint. But we're making good progress with we built an organization that is focused on dividends and integration of acquisitions that is performing incredibly well. So I believe that we've grown a new muscle in the company around diligence and integration of these acquisitions that we didn't have two years ago, and that is a muscle that will rely on going forward. Yes, let me first address LNG start and then I'll talk about refining. Look, the fact is that when these customers, operators making the final investment decision, they're making an investment decision for a 20, 30 year time frame. And the outlook for the use of LNG as a source of energy so these fluctuations \u2013 short-term fluctuations, I don't think they're going to change anything. The fact is that gas is considered will be a transition fuel for net-zero carbon emission ambitions. And the demand profile is there to support that greater investment that's gone into the ground to build this asset. So I don't think any of these changes for the storage is filled on out in Europe. With respect to refining, look, the fact is that refiners are feeling very bullish. I had the opportunity to meet over the weekend an individual in the trading function of an independent refining company. And I was actually surprised of how optimistic this person felt about their margins going forward because return only now that jet fuel demand is starting to come back, but this individual was also incredibly excited about diesel demand coming back, and these are two things that have been missing over the last 12 months. So this individual was not only optimistic about it today, but even the next six to 12 months. So I think \u2013 and it's what we're seeing from refiners. Good solid continued spend on our technologies. Yes. I believe [indiscernible] R&D organizations in the software industry, and they perform accordingly. So they were ahead of plan on the release of the SSE suite for Windows. I hope they achieve the same feed for the Venus version and the DGM suite because that will help us with our trajectory. Those transformations are hard, and you have to build momentum in the transformation because there's a lot of sort of infrastructure we have to put in place systems, processes best practices organizations. And we've done a lot of that now in the Q1 quarter. I believe we've built momentum, and we'll continue to build momentum in Q2. And that's why in the prepared remarks, we stated that we expect a lot of the transformation benefits to start showing off \u2013 to really show off in Q3, Q4. And look, from my own assessment, I do believe that our year will come together beautifully in the Q3, Q4 for quarters in the first half of next calender year. Hi, Mark. Yes. Just the latter. We didn't see any behavior change from chemical customers if you want. We just want to acknowledge that we're seeing this dynamic. And like I said, they're just coming down from record profitability and revenue in the quarter to quarter, something more normal, but nonetheless, it's a change, and we just want to highlight that to all of you. Look, so we keep our update for APM to the half year. So we do that in the January call. But Look, we continue to gain traction. I do think the market has sort of unfrozen from the pandemic period. We're seeing a lot more engagement with customers. We are seeing also bigger deals in the pipeline and more interest. I also think that customers after two, three years of trying to figure out what everything that they were being told by all these suppliers of technology and that they're sort of cutting through the noise and focusing on those technologies and capabilities that they think will help. And I'd like to think that AspenTech in that category. Well, I'll give you my impression and Chantelle give you hers. Look, first of all, when I first met with Lal Karsanbhai, one of my key ask was the oil side business, because I felt they had the potential to truly become a technology leader in the utilities industry. And basically, the last four, five months have only corroborated my \u2013 what I thought was the case. They have great technology. Their customers love their technology and what they do for them, and now with the scale of the new AspenTech and our channel to market on a global basis because they're a very North American-focused company, we'll be able to accelerate their expansion into international markets. So very excited about that. Look, it's been a great presence of price as well. They have unbelievable technology. We're going to be investing in that technology to accelerate some of their innovation. But more instantly, the whole perception of SSE by customers has changed now in their partnership and ownership by AspenTech. Again, back to this opportunity to optimize subsurface and above surface facilities, AspenTech's on capabilities in software and how we can contribute to SSE and SSE's expertise in upstream and now AspenTech being really the only company in the market that can model the entire petroleum supply chain from the rock to the corner gas station is a very unique capability. I started having meetings with customers immediately after we close the transaction and have been so excited about what I'm hearing from this customer. So I'm very optimistic. I love the fact that we own these businesses. And they totally reposition that and help us reposition usability, CCS, geothermal energy, electrification with our own capabilities around efficiency and clarity so really from a strong sustainability position going forward. Thank you, Justin, and thanks, everyone, for joining what is the first earnings call of the new AspenTech. We look forward to engaging with all of you on the road here in the next few weeks and months. Thanks."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that the conference is being recorded. I will now hand the conference over your speaker host, Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead.\nBrian Denyeau: Thank you, Olivia. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 ending June 30, 2024. With me on the call today are Antonio Pietri, AspenTech\u2019s President and CEO; and Dave Baker, AspenTech\u2019s CFO. Please note we have posted an earnings presentation on our IR website. This includes an explanation regarding the impact of ASC Topic 606 on our financial results. It also includes definitions of annual contract value, or ACV, bookings and free cash flow, among other metrics. We ask that investors refer to this presentation in conjunction with today\u2019s call. Starting on Slide 2, I want to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today\u2019s press release and in our annual report on Form 10-K and other subsequent filings made with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this presentation, we\u2019ll present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s earnings press release and investor presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks, Brian, and welcome to everyone joining us today. AspenTech delivered a strong fourth quarter to finish fiscal 2024. We achieved these results on the strength of our innovation and focused execution on a solid pipeline of business despite the persistence of a dynamic macro environment and cautious customer spending in some of our end markets. We were also pleased to see the benefits of our efficiency and productivity initiatives in the second half of fiscal 2024 come to fruition, delivering a favorable expense outcome for the full fiscal year. Our Q4 performance is a demonstration of what\u2019s possible as a result of our efforts over the past 2 years to integrate the Heritage AspenTech, DGM and SSE businesses while also transforming the DGM and SSE businesses. We believe these efforts are now largely completed, which coupled with our broad portfolio of mission-critical products, position AspenTech well to execute and deliver on an attractive combination of ACV growth and best-in-class profitability going forward. Additionally, we continue to make good progress in our commercial relationship with Emerson, and we expect these efforts to lead to further benefits in fiscal 2025 and beyond. Turning to Slide 3 for our Q4 and fiscal 2024 results. ACV was $968 million in the fourth quarter, representing 9.4% year-over-year growth and 3.5% sequential growth. Free cash flow was $335 million in fiscal 2024, slightly below our guidance and $153 million in the fourth quarter. I would also like to provide an update on our exit from Russia announced earlier today. We\u2019re exiting Russia following the U.S. government\u2019s recent announcement of expanded sanctions in the country prohibiting among other actions, the sales, service, maintenance and support of enterprise management software and design and manufacturing software in the Russian market. As a result of these measures and our exit from the Russian market, we have written off certain assets that are related to our operations in the country. From an ACV perspective, we have written off all Russia ACV for a reduction of approximately $35 million in our total ACV balance as of the end of fiscal 2024. Our new ACV balance is $933 million after adjusting to reflect the impact of this reduction. We have included tables in the appendix of our earnings presentations to help bridge these numbers for investors. Dave will address the other related areas in his remarks. As you will remember, we moved to renewals only in Russia in fiscal 2024. The contribution from this business in fiscal 2023 made it apparent that it was no longer going to be a material \u2013 was no longer going to be material to our overall growth profile resulting from the continued expansion of sanctions on the country. When removing all Russia ACV from our results, our fiscal 2023 growth rate improved 60 basis points from 11.8% to 12.4% year-over-year, while our fiscal 2024 growth rate also improved 60 basis points from 9.4% to 10% year-over-year. Relatedly, attrition in fiscal 2024 was 5.6% when including Russia ACV compared to 4.7% in the same period when removing Russia ACV. Now returning to our results, I would like to emphasize the following regarding our Q4 and fiscal 2024 outcomes. First, as I mentioned at the start, our performance in Q4 demonstrates the benefit of our transformation and integration efforts to bring together Heritage AspenTech, DGM and SSE and investments made over the past 2 years. The outcome achieved was execution-driven leveraging the platform built. We were also pleased to see the initial benefits from the sales expansion efforts made across the portfolio as we continue to advance and mature our business in these areas. Second, our innovation remains highly relevant and mission-critical to customers in asset-intensive industries. Throughout fiscal 2024, we work collaboratively with many leading players across our end markets to advance our product offerings and develop new solutions. By working alongside our customers and remaining focused on accelerating their operational excellence, we continue to be a key strategic partner, helping them to meet their efficiency and sustainability goals while navigating a dynamic macro environment. Third and final, we remain committed to driving increased efficiency and productivity across organization. With this focus, we have delivered lower expenses in the second half of fiscal 2024 relative to the first half of fiscal 2024. Looking ahead, we\u2019re confident in our ability to maintain expenses at current levels. We\u2019ll also continue to invest in strategic growth areas, including our DGM business. Turning to Slide 4. I will now provide an update on our suite performances in Q4 and fiscal 2024. Please note that all ACV growth figures referenced for suites will be based on our 9.4% year-over-year growth rate in fiscal 2024, which does not reflect the impact of the write-off related to the suspension of commercial activities in Russia. The digital grid management suite, or DGM, grew by approximately 40% in fiscal 2024 to contribute 2.5 points of growth in line with our expectation. This outcome is a testament to the strength of our DGM suite and products and the early benefits from building out DGM\u2019s go-to-market capabilities to date. It also underscores how we remain well positioned to be a prime beneficiary of the substantial CapEx tailwinds to modernize, expand and cybersecure grids around the world. Our outages, such as those recently experienced by the city of Houston, due to Hurricane Beryl highlight the need to create a more resilient grid in the face of more frequent and impactful weather events, including the capability to recover faster from them. These are the use cases that are recently launched AspenTech OSI outage management system was developed for and is now being deployed by utilities in North America. We also saw good momentum with utilities outside of North America as part of our Q4 success. In Europe, we signed our largest term software deal ever for the region to upgrade national grid operators existing SCADA and EMS solution while displacing a competitor. This utility was in the market for a solution that is modern, adaptable and most importantly, capable of helping them to ensure reliable real-time operations in the face of rapid renewables growth. In South America, we completed a significant term license deal with a long-standing customer that is also one of the region\u2019s largest transmission utility. With networks across multiple countries that continue to grow in complexity, this customer highly values our grid management capabilities and trusts our ability to help them navigate an evolving landscape after more than a decade of working together. These are just a few of the successes we saw with DGM in international markets in Q4. As a core driver of this suites growth, we\u2019re excited to build upon our successes globally going forward. The Subsurface Science and Engineering suite, or SSE, contributed 1 point of growth in fiscal 2024, in line with our expectations. SSE had a strong Q4 as it benefited from solid execution as well as customers\u2019 positive reception to the tokenization of our SSE products. We continue to see solid demand across the upstream market. During the quarter, for example, we further expanded our business with a national oil company in Asia for our advanced petrophysical analysis capabilities, in areas such as formation evaluation and reservoir characterization while also converting them from their prepared to a licensing arrangement to term software and tokens. This customer now has access to the full set of product capabilities in the SSE suite, which we expect will lead to use of other products, resulting in increased usage and spend with AspenTech. Turning to Slide 5. Our Heritage AspenTech suites contributed 6 points of growth in fiscal 2024, outperforming our expectations for 5.5 points of growth. The engineering suite represented 3.4 points of this total growth. Consistent with SSE, customer interest in our offerings remain solid in the upstream market. For example, we continue to expand our relationship with an upstream gas producer in Latin America that is leveraging our engineering suite capabilities to increase production from their gas fields by debottlenecking and optimizing their gas processing facilities. This equates to hundreds of millions of dollars in CapEx savings resulting in one of the most important ongoing value-creation use cases in our customer base. EPCs in particular, are benefiting from growing backlogs driven by CapEx strength in traditional energy and sustainability. In Q4, for example, we won a large 7-figure deal with a long-standing EPC customer. By expanding access to the engineering suite, this customer can now further optimize our engineering man-hour costs, streamline their facilities design processes and provide their customers with even more highly relevant asset design options, thereby improving their overall bidding prospects success. We also signed important sustainability related wins in Q4, even as growth in this area moderated relative to the first half of the year. As an example, we expanded our business with a leading sustainable aviation fuel company that is using our engineering suite to meet its operational performance objectives while scaling up. We\u2019re excited about the opportunity to continue partnering with this company going forward as it continues to grow and explore additional AspenTech offerings. The Manufacturing & Supply Chain suite, or MSC, contributed the other 2.6 points of HAT growth in fiscal 2024. Customers continue to see our MSC suite capabilities as essential to improving operational and financial performance and achieving their sustainability goals. As a result, we saw solid uptake across MSC in the second half of fiscal 2024 and especially in Q4, despite this suite experiencing the most pronounced impact from the extended downturn in chemicals. In Q4, we won several deals for our new Aspen Unified Planning and Scheduling Solution and leading multiunit optimization product, GDOT. For example, we signed a mid-7-figure deal with a leading refiner in North America based on the strength of our technology, domain expertise and dedication to co-innovation to support them in increasing operational efficiencies and creating a standardization and real-time visibility across their value chain in their next phase of their digitalization journey. We also signed a large deal with a leading refiner in Europe. This represents a continuation of a deeply collaborative relationship with the customer, who is now in the process of transforming their business from traditional refining to biofuels. Our ability to support biocomponent optimization through Unified was a key driver of our further expansion with this customer. Finally, the Asset Performance Management suite, or APM, performed as expected, remaining flat year-over-year. As I mentioned last quarter, we have simplified APM\u2019s go-to-market strategy and are increasing our focus on certain market segments where the use cases lead to significant value capture for customers and produce high-quality ACV for AspenTech. As a validation of our strategy calibration, we saw meaningful ACV growth contribution from these market segments in the Q4 quarter, which mitigated the attrition experienced from customers in market where we no longer focus on. We\u2019re in the early stages of our new strategy and plan for some moderate sales head count investment focused on APM sales in the market segments targeted going forward. On Slide 6, I would now like to provide an update on our innovation. As I highlighted on our last call, we held a successful OPTIMIZE user conference in early May. With a robust turnout, OPTIMIZE 24 was an excellent forum to reconnect with our users, align on shared visions of the future and drive further collaboration and co-innovation opportunities. We were excited to have received lots of positive feedback from customers about the event, our strategy and the Aspen technician leading to additional engagement opportunities in the quarter and adding to our existing pipeline of business. After OPTIMIZE, we continue to engage with customers around industrial AI which is how we refer to our unique plan of artificial intelligence, domain expertise and first principles based innovation. With a well-established track record in the field, we\u2019re seeing an acceleration of the interest from customers around our ability to deliver tangible value through our approach. This includes better modeling and optimization, decision support, predictive maintenance and more. As we drive further innovation around industrial AI, we believe that it will continue to serve as an important contributor to our growth. Finally, I\u2019m also excited to announce that we plan to release our new microgrid solution under general availability this quarter as part of our V14.4 update. While this solution is part of the DGM suite, we see a significant opportunity to expand it into downstream chemicals and refining markets, where there\u2019s increasing focus on ensuring resilient and reliable power supply as renewable energy is incorporated into their electrical networks. Turning to Slide 7. I would now like to close with guidance. We started this year with a solid pipeline of business and a strong foundation from the integration and transformation work over the past 2 years. With this phase of work now largely completed, our teams will be able to focus on capturing the opportunity in front of us. For fiscal 2025, we\u2019re targeting ACV growth of approximately 9%. This is based on a total ACV balance of $933 million as of the end of fiscal 2024, which reflects the removal of all Russia ACV. At the suite level, this includes expectations for approximately 5.5 points of growth from HAT, approximately 2.5 points of growth from DGM and approximately 1 point of growth from SSE. We also expect attrition to be approximately 4.5% in fiscal 2025, which improved on our ex Russia attrition rate of 4.7% in fiscal 2024. This guidance reflects the following macro assumptions. First, we expect end market demand trends to remain largely similar to what we saw in the second half of fiscal 2024. This includes continued strength with utilities and energy, muted growth in chemicals and a more moderate sustainability CapEx environment. Second, we expect the macro environment in fiscal 2025 to remain dynamic. This includes expectations for the continuation of cautious customer spending in the face of an uncertain economic environment. For free cash flow, we expect approximately $340 million in fiscal 2025. I would note that we expect underlying free cash flow growth in fiscal 2025 to be meaningfully stronger than our guidance indicates due to several one-time factors that Dave will address in a moment. Finally, we aim to deliver flat expenses year-over-year. As I touched on at the beginning, we established solid traction in this area in the second half of fiscal 2024. And this fiscal 2025 expense plan further emphasizes our commitment to leading a best-in-class profitability business. As part of these efforts, we have identified additional opportunities to further streamline the organization and align resources across AspenTech. Today, we announced a workforce reduction of approximately 5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, including actions related to our Russia exit. We are supporting the departing employees with appropriate severance packages and other services to help them in their transition to new opportunities. These type of decisions are never easy to make, and on behalf of the company, I want to thank all impacted employees for their service and contributions to AspenTech over the years. With that, I will turn it over to Dave for a review of our financial results. Dave?\nDave Baker: Thank you, Antonio, and hello, everyone. It is a pleasure to join my first call with AspenTech. I\u2019d like to start by thanking Chris Stagno for his excellent work in serving as the interim CFO role and working with the team to deliver a strong finish to our fiscal 2024. I\u2019m excited to join such a talented team and to partner with Antonio, Chris, our finance leaders and the broader executive team to continue to drive value and focused execution for AspenTech. I look forward to speaking with many of you in the days ahead. Turning to Slide 8 to review our Q4 and fiscal 2024 results. We grew ACV 9.4% year-over-year in fiscal 2024 and 3.5% quarter-over-quarter in Q4. This outcome was 40 basis points above our guidance for fiscal 2024, as we benefited from strong execution on a solid pipeline of business to close out the year. Total bookings were $416 million in Q4 and $1.16 billion in fiscal 2024 while revenue was $343 million in Q4 and $1.13 billion in fiscal 2024. Please note that our revenue is recognized under ASC Topic 606 and bookings and revenue are heavily impacted by contract renewal timing. Also, under our ASC Topic 606, the impact of additional sanctions on Russia resulted in a modification of all existing contracts with customers in the country for a net reduction of $5.5 million in Q4 revenue. For profitability, on a non-GAAP basis, we reported operating income of $173 million in Q4, representing a 50.6% non-GAAP operating margin. For fiscal 2024, we reported non-GAAP operating income of $456 million, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 40.5%. As Antonio noted, we saw strong traction on cost savings in the second half of our fiscal 2024, following more elevated expense outlays in the first half of fiscal 2024 to fuel our long-term growth. Net GAAP net income was $151 million in the quarter or $2.37 per share, compared to $138 million or $2.13 per share a year ago. Non-GAAP income was $422 million or $6.59 per share in fiscal 2024. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended fiscal 2024 with approximately $237 million of cash and cash equivalents and no debt. As of quarter end, we had approximately $23 million of cash in Russia that we are unable to transfer to other countries due to sanctions and their impact on banking in the country. We plan to use roughly half of this amount as we wind down our Russia operations in fiscal 2025, mostly in Q1, with the remainder staying on our balance sheet as restricted cash in noncurrent assets. We also enter into \u2013 we also entered into a new 5-year $200 million credit facility in Q4. On share repurchases, we completed our $300 million share repurchase authorization in Q4, repurchasing an additional 278,000 shares for $57 million. We also announced today that our Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase authorization for up to $100 million in fiscal 2025. We believe this is a prudent authorization amount that provides us flexibility to pursue M&A opportunities, which remains our top capital allocation priority while also returning capital to shareholders. On cash flows, we generated $155 million of cash flow from operations and $153 million of free cash flow in Q4. For the full year, we generated $340 million of cash flow from operations and $335 million of free cash flow, slightly below our expectations due to higher cash tax. Turning to Slide 9. I would like to now close with guidance. Consistent with prior fiscal years, we will continue to provide guidance on an annual basis. For fiscal 2025, we expect total ACV growth of approximately 9% year-over-year, from our base of $933 million as of the end of fiscal 2024. This includes expectations for attrition of approximately 4.5% and market conditions that are largely similar to what we experienced in the second half of fiscal 2024, as Antonio mentioned. We expect that total bookings of $1.17 billion, revenue of approximately $1.19 billion, GAAP net income of approximately $52 million and non-GAAP net income of approximately $478 million. From a cash flow perspective, we expect operating cash flows of approximately $357 million and free cash flow of approximately $340 million. This includes expectations for cash tax payments of $135 million and higher capital expenditures related to office buildouts. Turning to Slide 10. We have included a chart to help bridge our free cash flow guidance for investors. This includes two important considerations. First, we estimate that Russia free cash flow represented approximately $25 million in fiscal 2024. Second, we expect to use an additional $10 million in cash related to our Russia exit as well as $8 million in cash related to our restructuring charge. Adjusting for these one-time items, we expect to grow underlying free cash flow by 15% in fiscal 2025. For a complete review of our updated fiscal year \u201825 guidance, please refer to our earnings presentation slides now available on our IR website. Turning to Slide 11, I will now address our linearity expectations for the year. First, for ACV, we expect the cadence of new ACV to be similar to what we have seen historically. We also expect our Q1 sequential growth rate to be softer than we have seen in the past due to higher-than-normal concentration of attrition in the quarter. Second, the workforce reduction Antonio referenced earlier will impact our financials in the following ways. First, we expect to realize approximately $25 million in annualized cost savings from this action. This is aligned with our goal to keep costs flat, while also investing in strategic growth areas. Second, we expect the restructuring charge to be between $7 million to $9 million and for the majority of this charge to occur in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. On free cash flow, we expect to generate the substantial majority of our free cash flow in the second half of our fiscal year, consistent with our historical results. We also expect free cash flow to be near breakeven in the first quarter, which is consistent with our historical results and also due to the timing of one-off items related to our restructuring in Russia exit. Finally, we expect bookings of $681 million up for renewal in fiscal 2025, with $85 million up for renewal in Q1. In closing, we delivered a strong Q4 to finish our fiscal year. Look forward to fiscal \u2013 looking to fiscal 2025, we remain focused on driving further productivity and efficiency across the organization in-line with our targets for solid topline ACV growth and profitability improvements. Additionally, with a strong foundation in place for our expanded portfolio, we are confident in our ability to deliver value for customers while also navigating the current dynamic macro environment. With that, I will turn the call back to Antonio for his closing remarks. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks, Dave. Before we open it up to Q&A, I would like to announce that we will be holding an Investor Day on Tuesday, September 17, near our headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts. With 2 full years since our strategic transaction with Emerson and experience in operating our expanded portfolio, we\u2019re excited to come together for a more comprehensive discussion of what we have accomplished, as well as how we\u2019re positioned for long-term growth. For those interested in attending, please reach out to our Investor Relations team for additional information. We will also webcast the event live for those who are unable to make the trip. With that, we will open it up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Now first question coming from the line of Rob Oliver with Baird. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Rob.\nRob Oliver: Great. Hi, good afternoon. Hi, Antonio. Hi, Dave. I had two questions. Antonio, one for you and then one for Dave. So Antonio, I wanted to ask about some of the sales issues from last quarter, which you had cited that there were some sort of sales execution issues, I think largely pertaining to the Heritage AspenTech business, but correct me if I\u2019m wrong there. I just wanted to get an update from you now heading into the new fiscal year where you guys stand relative to the kind of sales, sales leadership and your confidence in the ability to drive that organization? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, let me look, I\u2019m very confident [Technical Difficulty] address all the execution issues that we saw in Q3. And moving forward is about executing with excellence. We quickly did an analysis after the end of Q3 to understand where we had some of the challenges. Of course, there was a much deeper review of deals and strategies to close those deals. And the results that we achieved in the quarter are a demonstration of what\u2019s possible here.\nRob Oliver: Great. Thanks, Antonio, I appreciate that. And then, Dave, if you\u2019ll allow me, just a 2-parter for you. One on \u2013 I know you mentioned the attrition will be slightly higher in Q1 when you walked us through the linearity. Why is that? And the attrition is coming down for the year and what gives you the confidence that you can achieve that? And then the second is just more of an open question, on yes, you\u2019ve been in your seat now for a quarter and wanted to get a sense from you of kind of where you see \u2013 you mentioned in your prepared remarks about value creation, and I would just love to hear where you \u2013 what gets you most excited now that you have a sense of the organization? Thank you very much.\nDave Baker: Sure, Rob. So the attrition question first with Q1, it really is just the timing of the renewals and when they land in the year and this year, there are more renewals land in Q1. And we are confident that we will see the attrition coming down just one with the exit from Russia, that helps. And then secondly, just based on the renewals that we have and we could scope out. We have good line of sight there and are confident in being able to deliver that. And then secondly, the first couple of months, it\u2019s been a lot of learning and working on partnering with Antonio, the executive team as well as finance to really understand. And as you look at going forward, it really is continued focus on the execution that we saw in Q4 and there\u2019s still work for us to do around bringing some of the back-office systems together, as well as some of the footprint consolidations and then just generally working with the team as we look at our operations and how we can continue to drive efficiency there across the entire organization.\nRob Oliver: Very helpful. Thank you, guys.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Hi, this is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew. Look, I think ACV growth rate ex Russia seems to have kind of bottomed you or stabilized with both third quarter and fourth quarter, up 10% year-over-year. I guess with easier comparisons ahead, what factors are you kind of seeing or baking into guidance to have that slowing ACV growth for fiscal \u201825?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, let me look, as we said in our prepared remarks, certainly, we still believe that there\u2019s an uncertain macro environment out in the marketplace. But equally, we\u2019re more cautious on the demand that we would expect to see from sustainability CapEx. We had a strong first half of the year in fiscal \u201824. We had a slower benefit from sustainability CapEx in the second half of fiscal \u201824. I think we \u2013 our assumption is that we\u2019ll continue to see that sort of environment in the second half of fiscal \u201824 into fiscal \u201825. Therefore, there\u2019s sort of a half year impact there. And considering some of the reports that we\u2019ve seen and uncertainty around demand, I think we\u2019re being more cautious around the refining demand. We saw very strong demand from refining in the second half of fiscal \u201824. We\u2019ve seen reports of compressed margins in refining. But overall, it\u2019s just a slightly lower expectation around refining demand. But overall, look, where we sit today, we feel very good about that 9%, and we\u2019ll certainly execute throughout the year to exceed that number.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Got it. And then just touching on the commercial relationship with Emerson. As you went through the year, did the kind of ACV contribution that you\u2019ve got through that channel improve? And how are you thinking about that within the fiscal \u201825 guidance? Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, certainly, now that we\u2019ve closed out fiscal \u201824, we can see that some of the adjustments that we made on our joint go-to-market activities at the beginning of fiscal \u201824 started to pay off, especially in the second half of the fiscal year. And now even here into Q1 fiscal \u201825, we see some solid opportunities that are resulting from our joint go-to-market activities, and we would expect to see a greater benefit from, really, what is a developing comfort between the two companies on how we need to be operating in the marketplace, the strengths of each other, and how we can leverage each other\u2019s capabilities and technology to create a 1 plus 1 equaling 3.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you so much.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Dylan Becker with William Blair. Your line is open.\nDylan Becker: Hi, Antonio. Hi, Dave. Thanks for taking the question. Nice job. Maybe first for Antonio, you called out a customer realizing $100 million plus in CapEx savings, pretty significant, obviously, ROI here. I wonder despite kind of a challenging macro backdrop you\u2019re seeing, how those customers are pairing the potential savings around some of their decisioning efforts, particularly if large kind of capital projects maybe are a bit more challenged to kick off throughout fiscal \u201825?\nAntonio Pietri: Well, let me look, this is the beauty of our technology in that \u2013 the use case that I referenced and it\u2019s hundreds of millions. I won\u2019t give you the specific number because it\u2019s actually these customers did present at OPTIMIZE, and I know you were there, Dylan, and he presented this specific use case. In the face of challenge CapEx, this customer is using our technology to find ways to debottleneck their existing gas processing facilities and optimize them for throughput. And therefore, they are generating incremental throughput through those facilities that saves them building a new facility that would cost them in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And that\u2019s how that use case comes about. So look, there\u2019s different ways that our customers innovate and use our software to create value. And I think this is a great example of what\u2019s possible with our technology.\nDylan Becker: Okay. That\u2019s great. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Antonio. And maybe somewhat for Dave, but maybe Antonio, you\u2019ve been here for a while too, calling for the significant kind of operating leverage growth on the back of some flat expenses. You\u2019ve done this in the past, right? So how should we think about kind of where that leverage is coming from? Sales efficiencies, synergies? And maybe how to think about the potential balance here between that margin leverage and the ability, as you guys kind of called out to optionally reinvest or use that as an optionality lever, if you will, in the potential situation where the environment does improve throughout the balance of the year? Thanks.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, let me first speak to look to my experience and Dave can chime in. Look, I\u2019ve always believed, and we know that one of the great strength of AspenTech is the leverage that we have in the model to increase sales with very little incremental spend as long as we\u2019re driving innovation into the market. So we continue to see that, and I would argue \u2013 I mean, Q4 had a big component of that. If you look at the DGM outcome that we achieved in the fiscal year and in Q4, a lot of the incremental ACV, the growth in ACV came from aftermarket sales to customers were \u2013 that already had an installed SCADA system from DGM the monarch system and an EMS solution, so the ability to expand sales with those customers. So ultimately, I think our relationship with customers, innovation and the token licensing model in that any innovation or new products that we develop or acquire and we can put into the suite and immediately it\u2019s available to every customer of AspenTech, create a highly leverageable go-to-market model. And that\u2019s the basis for our belief that we can run a best-in-class profitability business here, over time, as we scale the DGM, SSE and we continue to grow the AspenTech business.\nDylan Becker: That\u2019s great. Thanks, Antonio.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question coming from the line of Devin Au with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJason Celino: Hey, thanks. This is actually Jason. I was able to make it.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Jason.\nJason Celino: Maybe a couple of clarifying questions. So if we look at the growth in Q4, Russia \u2013 with Russia and without Russia, it looks like Russia is a tailwind \u2013 excluding the tailwind, is that just because Russia just wasn\u2019t growing and kind of a drag?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. As we said, I mean, in fiscal \u2013 we said in the remarks, in fiscal \u201823, it was clear that Russia wasn\u2019t going to be a contributor to growth based on the outcome that we achieved. And the fact is more or less the same outcome was experienced in fiscal \u201824. The benefit to the growth rate is when you take out the ACV that existed in Russia, then your denominator becomes smaller and therefore, your numerator produces a larger number, which is a faster or greater growth rate. That\u2019s the benefit of that.\nJason Celino: Okay, got it. Basic math. Yes. And then the restructuring, is that only impacting maybe your employees in Russia or is that restructuring other areas, just wanted to clarify?\nAntonio Pietri: No, no, this is broad-based across the company. The fact is that the Russia component is small. This is across every function and region.\nJason Celino: Okay, alright. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Nay Soe Naing with Berenberg. Your line is open.\nNay Soe Naing: Hi, thank you for giving the questions. I\u2019ve got a couple if I may. Firstly, starting with the chemicals vertical, please, it will be great to get an update on the macro dynamics there. We have now hit anniversary of when you guys started \u2013 the macro cycle started affecting your numbers. So it would be great to understand or if you feel like the balance cycle is now ahead of trough there going forward? And then secondly, this is now a few quarters that you\u2019re able to call out competitive wins in DGM. So it would be great to hear from you how you are able to achieve these competitive wins in this product market? That will be great. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Okay. Alright. Well, let me first address the first question. Look, the chemicals market continues to be, from an OpEx standpoint, continues to be depressed going through the trough. We have seen a couple of positive announcements from chemical companies where they\u2019re starting to see a pickup in demand, but a very preliminary. And doesn\u2019t \u2013 and in our opinion, doesn\u2019t change the trajectory of what we expect to see in fiscal \u201825, which is more of the same that we saw in fiscal \u201824. So our assumption for the fiscal year is that we will see little contribution from chemicals. And I just want to point out, I mean, chemicals is about 22% of our total ACV, which means that in a normal year, we would probably see about 20% of our growth coming from chemicals. So there\u2019s a significant component of our growth that is not producing \u2013 of our business that is not producing. And when it starts to pick up, we would expect to see that benefit in a meaningful manner to our overall growth rate. When it comes to DGM, look, in a way, the OSI business prior to Emerson and AspenTech, even though it was a 30-year-old business, it was a new kid on the block, and they developed a very contemporaneous technology with great capabilities, modern technology, a great cybersecurity, that when it\u2019s compared to the technology of the incumbents, it certainly outshines them from a capabilities, deployability, configurability, ease of use and so on and so forth. I have been in many controlled rooms of our customers in DGM over the last 18, 24 months. And you can see how happy these customers are with the dashboard and the user interfaces and everything that they use around DGM. So basically, it\u2019s just more contemporaneous technology, more modern, more cybersecure, more applications on top of the base data system. In my remarks, I referenced outage management, which is a new application that is becoming incredibly important for utilities in order to be able to pinpoint outages and recover from them faster. There is also capabilities around distributed energy resources, especially the use case around energy battery storage or renewable energy. So it\u2019s a combination of factors. And I just want to point out that when these utilities go out for \u2013 to upgrade their systems, they\u2019re either upgrading their system with the incumbent or they are choosing someone else that, therefore, results in a displacement and it is in those situations, where an OSI is chosen that we displaced because we are building our business, we are building our installed base and that will take many more years to accomplish, but it is the opportunity that we have ahead of us here.\nNay Soe Naing: Thank you so much. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question coming from the line of Joshua Tilton with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nArsenije Matovic: Hi. This is Arsenije on for Josh. So, I just wanted to understand the 4Q bookings coming ahead, I think of expectations. What drove that? And then on the flat bookings guidance for 2025 on a reported basis, not adjusting for Russia in \u201824 bookings and your renewal bookings $100 million higher than \u201824, does the guidance embed any conservatism in new bookings in addition to reflecting the impact of discontinuing Russia operations, and just a quick follow-up?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, let me \u2013 no doubt that the guidance for fiscal \u201825 assumes the discontinuation of Russian operations and the write-off of the ACV, which also means we are writing off equivalent amount of bookings associated with that ACV. So, you have to adjust for that. I also want to remind you that our \u2013 the profile, our bookings year-to-year is not consistent. It\u2019s a mountain range. And this year, we have coming up, we have the bookings that we have. We have a concentration of bookings in Q1. But the important thing to note is that just because we have a certain amount of bookings doesn\u2019t mean necessarily that those bookings generate an equal and proportional amount of growth in ACV. In the bookings, there is a combination of attrition. There is a combination of flat renewals and there is a combination of growth from some of those bookings. And depending on the contracts that are coming up for renewal is we produce a certain outcome from the bookings that are coming up from renewal. And then we have to go generate incremental growth from the existing contracts that are not coming up for renewal. And the fact is that most of the growth that we experienced in any given year is from contracts that are in the middle of the contract as opposed to coming up for renewal. I don\u2019t know if that answered your question.\nArsenije Matovic: That said on the forward bookings estimate. But just in terms of 4Q bookings, I think it was above expectations, unless I misunderstood something from the presentations. Why don\u2019t you clarify that, what drove that outperformance?\nAntonio Pietri: The Q4 outperformance, let me look. So, this is a thing about giving you all the bookings number, whether it\u2019s in a quarter or for the year. The fact of the matter is that we can also do early renewals of contracts that are in the future. And there was a contract that wasn\u2019t supposed to renew until this fiscal year, fiscal year \u201825 that was accelerated into Q4 as part of a bigger transaction for growth that was signed in the Q4 quarter. So, there was a repackaged incremental growth with an early renewal of a large contract, which then generated a larger amount of bookings that were not expected in the initial number that we gave you.\nArsenije Matovic: Got it. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And as there are no further questions in the Q&A queue, at this time, I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Antonio Pietri for any closing remarks.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, operator, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. We will be attending the Piper Sandler Growth Conference in the second week of September. As I mentioned earlier, we will also be holding an Investor Day on September 17th, please reach out to our Investor Relations team for more information on this event. And we look forward to catching up with many of you soon. Thank you everyone for joining and we will see you on the road. Thanks.\nOperator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Dave Baker",
            "content": "Thank you, Antonio, and hello, everyone. It is a pleasure to join my first call with AspenTech. I'd like to start by thanking Chris Stagno for his excellent work in serving as the interim CFO role and working with the team to deliver a strong finish to our fiscal 2024. I'm excited to join such a talented team and to partner with Antonio, Chris, our finance leaders and the broader executive team to continue to drive value and focused execution for AspenTech. I look forward to speaking with many of you in the days ahead. Turning to Slide 8 to review our Q4 and fiscal 2024 results. We grew ACV 9.4% year-over-year in fiscal 2024 and 3.5% quarter-over-quarter in Q4. This outcome was 40 basis points above our guidance for fiscal 2024, as we benefited from strong execution on a solid pipeline of business to close out the year. Total bookings were $416 million in Q4 and $1.16 billion in fiscal 2024 while revenue was $343 million in Q4 and $1.13 billion in fiscal 2024. Please note that our revenue is recognized under ASC Topic 606 and bookings and revenue are heavily impacted by contract renewal timing. Also, under our ASC Topic 606, the impact of additional sanctions on Russia resulted in a modification of all existing contracts with customers in the country for a net reduction of $5.5 million in Q4 revenue. For profitability, on a non-GAAP basis, we reported operating income of $173 million in Q4, representing a 50.6% non-GAAP operating margin. For fiscal 2024, we reported non-GAAP operating income of $456 million, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 40.5%. As Antonio noted, we saw strong traction on cost savings in the second half of our fiscal 2024, following more elevated expense outlays in the first half of fiscal 2024 to fuel our long-term growth. Net GAAP net income was $151 million in the quarter or $2.37 per share, compared to $138 million or $2.13 per share a year ago. Non-GAAP income was $422 million or $6.59 per share in fiscal 2024. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended fiscal 2024 with approximately $237 million of cash and cash equivalents and no debt. As of quarter end, we had approximately $23 million of cash in Russia that we are unable to transfer to other countries due to sanctions and their impact on banking in the country. We plan to use roughly half of this amount as we wind down our Russia operations in fiscal 2025, mostly in Q1, with the remainder staying on our balance sheet as restricted cash in noncurrent assets. We also enter into \u2013 we also entered into a new 5-year $200 million credit facility in Q4. On share repurchases, we completed our $300 million share repurchase authorization in Q4, repurchasing an additional 278,000 shares for $57 million. We also announced today that our Board of Directors has approved a share repurchase authorization for up to $100 million in fiscal 2025. We believe this is a prudent authorization amount that provides us flexibility to pursue M&A opportunities, which remains our top capital allocation priority while also returning capital to shareholders. On cash flows, we generated $155 million of cash flow from operations and $153 million of free cash flow in Q4. For the full year, we generated $340 million of cash flow from operations and $335 million of free cash flow, slightly below our expectations due to higher cash tax. Turning to Slide 9. I would like to now close with guidance. Consistent with prior fiscal years, we will continue to provide guidance on an annual basis. For fiscal 2025, we expect total ACV growth of approximately 9% year-over-year, from our base of $933 million as of the end of fiscal 2024. This includes expectations for attrition of approximately 4.5% and market conditions that are largely similar to what we experienced in the second half of fiscal 2024, as Antonio mentioned. We expect that total bookings of $1.17 billion, revenue of approximately $1.19 billion, GAAP net income of approximately $52 million and non-GAAP net income of approximately $478 million. From a cash flow perspective, we expect operating cash flows of approximately $357 million and free cash flow of approximately $340 million. This includes expectations for cash tax payments of $135 million and higher capital expenditures related to office buildouts. Turning to Slide 10. We have included a chart to help bridge our free cash flow guidance for investors. This includes two important considerations. First, we estimate that Russia free cash flow represented approximately $25 million in fiscal 2024. Second, we expect to use an additional $10 million in cash related to our Russia exit as well as $8 million in cash related to our restructuring charge. Adjusting for these one-time items, we expect to grow underlying free cash flow by 15% in fiscal 2025. For a complete review of our updated fiscal year \u201825 guidance, please refer to our earnings presentation slides now available on our IR website. Turning to Slide 11, I will now address our linearity expectations for the year. First, for ACV, we expect the cadence of new ACV to be similar to what we have seen historically. We also expect our Q1 sequential growth rate to be softer than we have seen in the past due to higher-than-normal concentration of attrition in the quarter. Second, the workforce reduction Antonio referenced earlier will impact our financials in the following ways. First, we expect to realize approximately $25 million in annualized cost savings from this action. This is aligned with our goal to keep costs flat, while also investing in strategic growth areas. Second, we expect the restructuring charge to be between $7 million to $9 million and for the majority of this charge to occur in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. On free cash flow, we expect to generate the substantial majority of our free cash flow in the second half of our fiscal year, consistent with our historical results. We also expect free cash flow to be near breakeven in the first quarter, which is consistent with our historical results and also due to the timing of one-off items related to our restructuring in Russia exit. Finally, we expect bookings of $681 million up for renewal in fiscal 2025, with $85 million up for renewal in Q1. In closing, we delivered a strong Q4 to finish our fiscal year. Look forward to fiscal \u2013 looking to fiscal 2025, we remain focused on driving further productivity and efficiency across the organization in-line with our targets for solid topline ACV growth and profitability improvements. Additionally, with a strong foundation in place for our expanded portfolio, we are confident in our ability to deliver value for customers while also navigating the current dynamic macro environment. With that, I will turn the call back to Antonio for his closing remarks. Antonio? Sure, Rob. So the attrition question first with Q1, it really is just the timing of the renewals and when they land in the year and this year, there are more renewals land in Q1. And we are confident that we will see the attrition coming down just one with the exit from Russia, that helps. And then secondly, just based on the renewals that we have and we could scope out. We have good line of sight there and are confident in being able to deliver that. And then secondly, the first couple of months, it's been a lot of learning and working on partnering with Antonio, the executive team as well as finance to really understand. And as you look at going forward, it really is continued focus on the execution that we saw in Q4 and there's still work for us to do around bringing some of the back-office systems together, as well as some of the footprint consolidations and then just generally working with the team as we look at our operations and how we can continue to drive efficiency there across the entire organization."

            "name": "Antonio Pietri",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and welcome to everyone joining us today. AspenTech delivered a strong fourth quarter to finish fiscal 2024. We achieved these results on the strength of our innovation and focused execution on a solid pipeline of business despite the persistence of a dynamic macro environment and cautious customer spending in some of our end markets. We were also pleased to see the benefits of our efficiency and productivity initiatives in the second half of fiscal 2024 come to fruition, delivering a favorable expense outcome for the full fiscal year. Our Q4 performance is a demonstration of what's possible as a result of our efforts over the past 2 years to integrate the Heritage AspenTech, DGM and SSE businesses while also transforming the DGM and SSE businesses. We believe these efforts are now largely completed, which coupled with our broad portfolio of mission-critical products, position AspenTech well to execute and deliver on an attractive combination of ACV growth and best-in-class profitability going forward. Additionally, we continue to make good progress in our commercial relationship with Emerson, and we expect these efforts to lead to further benefits in fiscal 2025 and beyond. Turning to Slide 3 for our Q4 and fiscal 2024 results. ACV was $968 million in the fourth quarter, representing 9.4% year-over-year growth and 3.5% sequential growth. Free cash flow was $335 million in fiscal 2024, slightly below our guidance and $153 million in the fourth quarter. I would also like to provide an update on our exit from Russia announced earlier today. We're exiting Russia following the U.S. government's recent announcement of expanded sanctions in the country prohibiting among other actions, the sales, service, maintenance and support of enterprise management software and design and manufacturing software in the Russian market. As a result of these measures and our exit from the Russian market, we have written off certain assets that are related to our operations in the country. From an ACV perspective, we have written off all Russia ACV for a reduction of approximately $35 million in our total ACV balance as of the end of fiscal 2024. Our new ACV balance is $933 million after adjusting to reflect the impact of this reduction. We have included tables in the appendix of our earnings presentations to help bridge these numbers for investors. Dave will address the other related areas in his remarks. As you will remember, we moved to renewals only in Russia in fiscal 2024. The contribution from this business in fiscal 2023 made it apparent that it was no longer going to be a material \u2013 was no longer going to be material to our overall growth profile resulting from the continued expansion of sanctions on the country. When removing all Russia ACV from our results, our fiscal 2023 growth rate improved 60 basis points from 11.8% to 12.4% year-over-year, while our fiscal 2024 growth rate also improved 60 basis points from 9.4% to 10% year-over-year. Relatedly, attrition in fiscal 2024 was 5.6% when including Russia ACV compared to 4.7% in the same period when removing Russia ACV. Now returning to our results, I would like to emphasize the following regarding our Q4 and fiscal 2024 outcomes. First, as I mentioned at the start, our performance in Q4 demonstrates the benefit of our transformation and integration efforts to bring together Heritage AspenTech, DGM and SSE and investments made over the past 2 years. The outcome achieved was execution-driven leveraging the platform built. We were also pleased to see the initial benefits from the sales expansion efforts made across the portfolio as we continue to advance and mature our business in these areas. Second, our innovation remains highly relevant and mission-critical to customers in asset-intensive industries. Throughout fiscal 2024, we work collaboratively with many leading players across our end markets to advance our product offerings and develop new solutions. By working alongside our customers and remaining focused on accelerating their operational excellence, we continue to be a key strategic partner, helping them to meet their efficiency and sustainability goals while navigating a dynamic macro environment. Third and final, we remain committed to driving increased efficiency and productivity across organization. With this focus, we have delivered lower expenses in the second half of fiscal 2024 relative to the first half of fiscal 2024. Looking ahead, we're confident in our ability to maintain expenses at current levels. We'll also continue to invest in strategic growth areas, including our DGM business. Turning to Slide 4. I will now provide an update on our suite performances in Q4 and fiscal 2024. Please note that all ACV growth figures referenced for suites will be based on our 9.4% year-over-year growth rate in fiscal 2024, which does not reflect the impact of the write-off related to the suspension of commercial activities in Russia. The digital grid management suite, or DGM, grew by approximately 40% in fiscal 2024 to contribute 2.5 points of growth in line with our expectation. This outcome is a testament to the strength of our DGM suite and products and the early benefits from building out DGM's go-to-market capabilities to date. It also underscores how we remain well positioned to be a prime beneficiary of the substantial CapEx tailwinds to modernize, expand and cybersecure grids around the world. Our outages, such as those recently experienced by the city of Houston, due to Hurricane Beryl highlight the need to create a more resilient grid in the face of more frequent and impactful weather events, including the capability to recover faster from them. These are the use cases that are recently launched AspenTech OSI outage management system was developed for and is now being deployed by utilities in North America. We also saw good momentum with utilities outside of North America as part of our Q4 success. In Europe, we signed our largest term software deal ever for the region to upgrade national grid operators existing SCADA and EMS solution while displacing a competitor. This utility was in the market for a solution that is modern, adaptable and most importantly, capable of helping them to ensure reliable real-time operations in the face of rapid renewables growth. In South America, we completed a significant term license deal with a long-standing customer that is also one of the region's largest transmission utility. With networks across multiple countries that continue to grow in complexity, this customer highly values our grid management capabilities and trusts our ability to help them navigate an evolving landscape after more than a decade of working together. These are just a few of the successes we saw with DGM in international markets in Q4. As a core driver of this suites growth, we're excited to build upon our successes globally going forward. The Subsurface Science and Engineering suite, or SSE, contributed 1 point of growth in fiscal 2024, in line with our expectations. SSE had a strong Q4 as it benefited from solid execution as well as customers' positive reception to the tokenization of our SSE products. We continue to see solid demand across the upstream market. During the quarter, for example, we further expanded our business with a national oil company in Asia for our advanced petrophysical analysis capabilities, in areas such as formation evaluation and reservoir characterization while also converting them from their prepared to a licensing arrangement to term software and tokens. This customer now has access to the full set of product capabilities in the SSE suite, which we expect will lead to use of other products, resulting in increased usage and spend with AspenTech. Turning to Slide 5. Our Heritage AspenTech suites contributed 6 points of growth in fiscal 2024, outperforming our expectations for 5.5 points of growth. The engineering suite represented 3.4 points of this total growth. Consistent with SSE, customer interest in our offerings remain solid in the upstream market. For example, we continue to expand our relationship with an upstream gas producer in Latin America that is leveraging our engineering suite capabilities to increase production from their gas fields by debottlenecking and optimizing their gas processing facilities. This equates to hundreds of millions of dollars in CapEx savings resulting in one of the most important ongoing value-creation use cases in our customer base. EPCs in particular, are benefiting from growing backlogs driven by CapEx strength in traditional energy and sustainability. In Q4, for example, we won a large 7-figure deal with a long-standing EPC customer. By expanding access to the engineering suite, this customer can now further optimize our engineering man-hour costs, streamline their facilities design processes and provide their customers with even more highly relevant asset design options, thereby improving their overall bidding prospects success. We also signed important sustainability related wins in Q4, even as growth in this area moderated relative to the first half of the year. As an example, we expanded our business with a leading sustainable aviation fuel company that is using our engineering suite to meet its operational performance objectives while scaling up. We're excited about the opportunity to continue partnering with this company going forward as it continues to grow and explore additional AspenTech offerings. The Manufacturing & Supply Chain suite, or MSC, contributed the other 2.6 points of HAT growth in fiscal 2024. Customers continue to see our MSC suite capabilities as essential to improving operational and financial performance and achieving their sustainability goals. As a result, we saw solid uptake across MSC in the second half of fiscal 2024 and especially in Q4, despite this suite experiencing the most pronounced impact from the extended downturn in chemicals. In Q4, we won several deals for our new Aspen Unified Planning and Scheduling Solution and leading multiunit optimization product, GDOT. For example, we signed a mid-7-figure deal with a leading refiner in North America based on the strength of our technology, domain expertise and dedication to co-innovation to support them in increasing operational efficiencies and creating a standardization and real-time visibility across their value chain in their next phase of their digitalization journey. We also signed a large deal with a leading refiner in Europe. This represents a continuation of a deeply collaborative relationship with the customer, who is now in the process of transforming their business from traditional refining to biofuels. Our ability to support biocomponent optimization through Unified was a key driver of our further expansion with this customer. Finally, the Asset Performance Management suite, or APM, performed as expected, remaining flat year-over-year. As I mentioned last quarter, we have simplified APM's go-to-market strategy and are increasing our focus on certain market segments where the use cases lead to significant value capture for customers and produce high-quality ACV for AspenTech. As a validation of our strategy calibration, we saw meaningful ACV growth contribution from these market segments in the Q4 quarter, which mitigated the attrition experienced from customers in market where we no longer focus on. We're in the early stages of our new strategy and plan for some moderate sales head count investment focused on APM sales in the market segments targeted going forward. On Slide 6, I would now like to provide an update on our innovation. As I highlighted on our last call, we held a successful OPTIMIZE user conference in early May. With a robust turnout, OPTIMIZE 24 was an excellent forum to reconnect with our users, align on shared visions of the future and drive further collaboration and co-innovation opportunities. We were excited to have received lots of positive feedback from customers about the event, our strategy and the Aspen technician leading to additional engagement opportunities in the quarter and adding to our existing pipeline of business. After OPTIMIZE, we continue to engage with customers around industrial AI which is how we refer to our unique plan of artificial intelligence, domain expertise and first principles based innovation. With a well-established track record in the field, we're seeing an acceleration of the interest from customers around our ability to deliver tangible value through our approach. This includes better modeling and optimization, decision support, predictive maintenance and more. As we drive further innovation around industrial AI, we believe that it will continue to serve as an important contributor to our growth. Finally, I'm also excited to announce that we plan to release our new microgrid solution under general availability this quarter as part of our V14.4 update. While this solution is part of the DGM suite, we see a significant opportunity to expand it into downstream chemicals and refining markets, where there's increasing focus on ensuring resilient and reliable power supply as renewable energy is incorporated into their electrical networks. Turning to Slide 7. I would now like to close with guidance. We started this year with a solid pipeline of business and a strong foundation from the integration and transformation work over the past 2 years. With this phase of work now largely completed, our teams will be able to focus on capturing the opportunity in front of us. For fiscal 2025, we're targeting ACV growth of approximately 9%. This is based on a total ACV balance of $933 million as of the end of fiscal 2024, which reflects the removal of all Russia ACV. At the suite level, this includes expectations for approximately 5.5 points of growth from HAT, approximately 2.5 points of growth from DGM and approximately 1 point of growth from SSE. We also expect attrition to be approximately 4.5% in fiscal 2025, which improved on our ex Russia attrition rate of 4.7% in fiscal 2024. This guidance reflects the following macro assumptions. First, we expect end market demand trends to remain largely similar to what we saw in the second half of fiscal 2024. This includes continued strength with utilities and energy, muted growth in chemicals and a more moderate sustainability CapEx environment. Second, we expect the macro environment in fiscal 2025 to remain dynamic. This includes expectations for the continuation of cautious customer spending in the face of an uncertain economic environment. For free cash flow, we expect approximately $340 million in fiscal 2025. I would note that we expect underlying free cash flow growth in fiscal 2025 to be meaningfully stronger than our guidance indicates due to several one-time factors that Dave will address in a moment. Finally, we aim to deliver flat expenses year-over-year. As I touched on at the beginning, we established solid traction in this area in the second half of fiscal 2024. And this fiscal 2025 expense plan further emphasizes our commitment to leading a best-in-class profitability business. As part of these efforts, we have identified additional opportunities to further streamline the organization and align resources across AspenTech. Today, we announced a workforce reduction of approximately 5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, including actions related to our Russia exit. We are supporting the departing employees with appropriate severance packages and other services to help them in their transition to new opportunities. These type of decisions are never easy to make, and on behalf of the company, I want to thank all impacted employees for their service and contributions to AspenTech over the years. With that, I will turn it over to Dave for a review of our financial results. Dave? Thanks, Dave. Before we open it up to Q&A, I would like to announce that we will be holding an Investor Day on Tuesday, September 17, near our headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts. With 2 full years since our strategic transaction with Emerson and experience in operating our expanded portfolio, we're excited to come together for a more comprehensive discussion of what we have accomplished, as well as how we're positioned for long-term growth. For those interested in attending, please reach out to our Investor Relations team for additional information. We will also webcast the event live for those who are unable to make the trip. With that, we will open it up to questions. Operator? Hi, Rob. Yes. Well, let me look, I'm very confident [Technical Difficulty] address all the execution issues that we saw in Q3. And moving forward is about executing with excellence. We quickly did an analysis after the end of Q3 to understand where we had some of the challenges. Of course, there was a much deeper review of deals and strategies to close those deals. And the results that we achieved in the quarter are a demonstration of what's possible here. Thank you. Yes. Well, let me look, as we said in our prepared remarks, certainly, we still believe that there's an uncertain macro environment out in the marketplace. But equally, we're more cautious on the demand that we would expect to see from sustainability CapEx. We had a strong first half of the year in fiscal \u201824. We had a slower benefit from sustainability CapEx in the second half of fiscal \u201824. I think we \u2013 our assumption is that we'll continue to see that sort of environment in the second half of fiscal \u201824 into fiscal \u201825. Therefore, there's sort of a half year impact there. And considering some of the reports that we've seen and uncertainty around demand, I think we're being more cautious around the refining demand. We saw very strong demand from refining in the second half of fiscal \u201824. We've seen reports of compressed margins in refining. But overall, it's just a slightly lower expectation around refining demand. But overall, look, where we sit today, we feel very good about that 9%, and we'll certainly execute throughout the year to exceed that number. Yes. Look, certainly, now that we've closed out fiscal \u201824, we can see that some of the adjustments that we made on our joint go-to-market activities at the beginning of fiscal \u201824 started to pay off, especially in the second half of the fiscal year. And now even here into Q1 fiscal \u201825, we see some solid opportunities that are resulting from our joint go-to-market activities, and we would expect to see a greater benefit from, really, what is a developing comfort between the two companies on how we need to be operating in the marketplace, the strengths of each other, and how we can leverage each other's capabilities and technology to create a 1 plus 1 equaling 3. Thank you. Well, let me look, this is the beauty of our technology in that \u2013 the use case that I referenced and it's hundreds of millions. I won't give you the specific number because it's actually these customers did present at OPTIMIZE, and I know you were there, Dylan, and he presented this specific use case. In the face of challenge CapEx, this customer is using our technology to find ways to debottleneck their existing gas processing facilities and optimize them for throughput. And therefore, they are generating incremental throughput through those facilities that saves them building a new facility that would cost them in the hundreds of millions of dollars. And that's how that use case comes about. So look, there's different ways that our customers innovate and use our software to create value. And I think this is a great example of what's possible with our technology. Yes. Well, let me first speak to look to my experience and Dave can chime in. Look, I've always believed, and we know that one of the great strength of AspenTech is the leverage that we have in the model to increase sales with very little incremental spend as long as we're driving innovation into the market. So we continue to see that, and I would argue \u2013 I mean, Q4 had a big component of that. If you look at the DGM outcome that we achieved in the fiscal year and in Q4, a lot of the incremental ACV, the growth in ACV came from aftermarket sales to customers were \u2013 that already had an installed SCADA system from DGM the monarch system and an EMS solution, so the ability to expand sales with those customers. So ultimately, I think our relationship with customers, innovation and the token licensing model in that any innovation or new products that we develop or acquire and we can put into the suite and immediately it's available to every customer of AspenTech, create a highly leverageable go-to-market model. And that's the basis for our belief that we can run a best-in-class profitability business here, over time, as we scale the DGM, SSE and we continue to grow the AspenTech business. Hi, Jason. Yes. As we said, I mean, in fiscal \u2013 we said in the remarks, in fiscal \u201823, it was clear that Russia wasn't going to be a contributor to growth based on the outcome that we achieved. And the fact is more or less the same outcome was experienced in fiscal \u201824. The benefit to the growth rate is when you take out the ACV that existed in Russia, then your denominator becomes smaller and therefore, your numerator produces a larger number, which is a faster or greater growth rate. That's the benefit of that. No, no, this is broad-based across the company. The fact is that the Russia component is small. This is across every function and region. Thanks. Okay. Alright. Well, let me first address the first question. Look, the chemicals market continues to be, from an OpEx standpoint, continues to be depressed going through the trough. We have seen a couple of positive announcements from chemical companies where they're starting to see a pickup in demand, but a very preliminary. And doesn't \u2013 and in our opinion, doesn't change the trajectory of what we expect to see in fiscal \u201825, which is more of the same that we saw in fiscal \u201824. So our assumption for the fiscal year is that we will see little contribution from chemicals. And I just want to point out, I mean, chemicals is about 22% of our total ACV, which means that in a normal year, we would probably see about 20% of our growth coming from chemicals. So there's a significant component of our growth that is not producing \u2013 of our business that is not producing. And when it starts to pick up, we would expect to see that benefit in a meaningful manner to our overall growth rate. When it comes to DGM, look, in a way, the OSI business prior to Emerson and AspenTech, even though it was a 30-year-old business, it was a new kid on the block, and they developed a very contemporaneous technology with great capabilities, modern technology, a great cybersecurity, that when it's compared to the technology of the incumbents, it certainly outshines them from a capabilities, deployability, configurability, ease of use and so on and so forth. I have been in many controlled rooms of our customers in DGM over the last 18, 24 months. And you can see how happy these customers are with the dashboard and the user interfaces and everything that they use around DGM. So basically, it's just more contemporaneous technology, more modern, more cybersecure, more applications on top of the base data system. In my remarks, I referenced outage management, which is a new application that is becoming incredibly important for utilities in order to be able to pinpoint outages and recover from them faster. There is also capabilities around distributed energy resources, especially the use case around energy battery storage or renewable energy. So it's a combination of factors. And I just want to point out that when these utilities go out for \u2013 to upgrade their systems, they're either upgrading their system with the incumbent or they are choosing someone else that, therefore, results in a displacement and it is in those situations, where an OSI is chosen that we displaced because we are building our business, we are building our installed base and that will take many more years to accomplish, but it is the opportunity that we have ahead of us here. Yes. You're welcome. Yes. Well, let me \u2013 no doubt that the guidance for fiscal \u201825 assumes the discontinuation of Russian operations and the write-off of the ACV, which also means we are writing off equivalent amount of bookings associated with that ACV. So, you have to adjust for that. I also want to remind you that our \u2013 the profile, our bookings year-to-year is not consistent. It's a mountain range. And this year, we have coming up, we have the bookings that we have. We have a concentration of bookings in Q1. But the important thing to note is that just because we have a certain amount of bookings doesn't mean necessarily that those bookings generate an equal and proportional amount of growth in ACV. In the bookings, there is a combination of attrition. There is a combination of flat renewals and there is a combination of growth from some of those bookings. And depending on the contracts that are coming up for renewal is we produce a certain outcome from the bookings that are coming up from renewal. And then we have to go generate incremental growth from the existing contracts that are not coming up for renewal. And the fact is that most of the growth that we experienced in any given year is from contracts that are in the middle of the contract as opposed to coming up for renewal. I don't know if that answered your question. The Q4 outperformance, let me look. So, this is a thing about giving you all the bookings number, whether it's in a quarter or for the year. The fact of the matter is that we can also do early renewals of contracts that are in the future. And there was a contract that wasn't supposed to renew until this fiscal year, fiscal year \u201825 that was accelerated into Q4 as part of a bigger transaction for growth that was signed in the Q4 quarter. So, there was a repackaged incremental growth with an early renewal of a large contract, which then generated a larger amount of bookings that were not expected in the initial number that we gave you. You're welcome. Thank you, operator, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. We will be attending the Piper Sandler Growth Conference in the second week of September. As I mentioned earlier, we will also be holding an Investor Day on September 17th, please reach out to our Investor Relations team for more information on this event. And we look forward to catching up with many of you soon. Thank you everyone for joining and we will see you on the road. Thanks."

Welcome to the Q3 Fiscal 2024 Aspen Technology Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Brian Denyeau from ICR.\nBrian Denyeau: Thank you, Josh. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 ending March 31, 2024. With me on the call today are Antonio Pietri, AspenTech's President and CEO; and Chris Stagno, AspenTech's Interim CFO. Please note we have posted earnings presentation on our IR website, and we ask that investors refer to this presentation in conjunction with today's call. Starting on Slide 2, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's press release and in our annual report on Form 10-K and other subsequent filings made with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this presentation, we will present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release and investor presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks, Brian, and welcome to everyone joining us today. Before I get into our results, I would like to highlight our flagship optimize user conference, which we held last week in Houston, Texas with a theme of Partnering for the Future. This was the first time that the new AspenTech organization has held an optimized event, and we were pleased to see many new and familiar faces in attendance. More than ever, our customers are focused on addressing the dual challenge of meeting the increasing demand for resources from a growing population with an increasing standard of living, while also addressing the sustainability imperative. At its core, this requires leading the organizations through a transformation that will require a heavy investment in digitalization and new technologies to meet performance, resiliency and sustainability objectives. We believe the strong customer attendance and discussions held at the conference are representative of the opportunity available to AspenTech in the future. Now turning to Slide 3 for our Q3 results. We remain incredibly excited about the market opportunity we're seeing as reflected in the ongoing and healthy growth of our pipeline. That said, the volume of business closed in the quarter did not meet our expectations or reflect the opportunity available to us. Annual contract value or ACV was $936 million in Q3, increasing 2.4% quarter-over-quarter and 9.5% year-over-year and included the closing of the delayed renewal agreement that I had referenced on our prior Q2 earnings call. Free cash flow was $137 million in Q3. The lower than expected ACV growth in the quarter was driven by what we believe was a slow start to budget deployments by customers in their new fiscal year, and secondarily and to a much lesser degree, our maturing sales organization. On the customer side, while customers remained engaged throughout the quarter on exciting value creation opportunities and discussions, ultimately their conviction to close business in the quarter waned in the last month. We saw closing timelines extend beyond the quarter exercise more caution in final purchasing decisions. These dynamics were prevalent across most regions and end markets in the quarter. We believe this reflected customers' need for additional time to evaluate their own end markets and budgetary allocations in the context of uncertainty created by a dynamic macro environment. That said, customers continue to communicate that their budgets are generally consistent with those of calendar 2023 and we're also seeing that strength exhibited in our pipeline. We continue to monitor this dynamic closely and are doing everything within our control to drive faster decision making to meet our sales goals. On the sales side, we saw some instances where our sales execution was below our expectations as we continue to onboard our expanded sales team and institutionalize best practices. Over the past 12 to 18 months, we have put in place new sales leadership, expanded our overall sales team and adjusted sales coverage for a significant portion of our customer base. We believe the combination of a still maturing sales team and a more cautious spending environment created some missed opportunities in Q3. We remain confident the investments and changes made to our sales organization will best position us to fully capitalize on our long-term growth opportunity. While we cannot control spending caution among global customers, we can actively address those things that we can control. To that end, in the near-term, we are working to drive full alignment across and return our sales execution and predictability to the level that we expect of ourselves as a high performance organization. Considering our Q3 performance, we are lowering our ACV growth outlook to at least 9.9% in fiscal year 2024. We believe this target is prudent when considering the dynamic we saw in Q3. We're also updating our fiscal year 2024 free cash flow guide to at least $340 million, which is mainly a function of softer net new ACV in Q3. Chris will provide more color on our financials in his remarks. With that said, I will now turn to Slide 4 to provide an update on our suite's performances in Q3 as well as our updated expectations for fiscal year 2024. Starting with Digital Grid Management or DGM, this suite saw continued strength in demand and signed several term license wins in Q3, as we continue to expand wallet share with existing customers and win new loads. During the quarter, for example, we won a large distribution management and optimization deal in North America, beating the competition across nearly all evaluation categories including compliance, technology, security and performance. Overall, we continue to be excited about the outlook and prospects for this suite. Demand for our grid innovation remains strong as the acceleration of global electrification and prioritization of energy security drives an unprecedented investment cycle to update and modernize the grid. The combination of these funding tailwinds and the strength of our grid technology is helping to drive a strong term pipeline growth for DGM both in the United States and international markets. Separately, as we've mentioned in the past, utility customers have a materially different and longer procurement process than our older customer segments. We continue to make progress in refining and strengthening our sales forecasting in this area considering the purchasing process characteristics associated with these deals. Overall, we are pleased with DGM's year-to-date performance and it remains on track to deliver approximately 2.5 points of growth for our fiscal year 2024. Subsurface Science & Engineering or SSE had a softer quarter. In Q3, SSE had its largest block of contracts up for renewal. This backdrop combined with the two factors I laid out at the top of the call resulted in deals that pushed out of the quarter and more muted growth. We now expect to close many of these deals this quarter. With that said, the backdrop for SSE customers remains strong with solid CapEx and operating budgets in place for the remainder of the calendar year. In Q3, for example, we further expanded our existing SSE business with a national oil company in Latin America. This customer values the strength of our seismic technology and has shown significant interest in converting to tokenization down the road to access our entire portfolio of subsurface innovation more easily. Taking all these into consideration, we now expect approximately one point of growth from SSE in our fiscal year 2024. Turning to Slide 5 and our Heritage AspenTech Suites. This is the part of the business where the two drivers I laid out regarding our Q3 performance were most notable. Engineering saw a significant number of deals pushed out of the quarter across all regions, marking a slowdown from the Suite's prior accelerated levels in the first half. This was more prevalent in our High Velocity Sales or HVS organization, which is one of the areas where we have increased our sales headcount significantly over the past several quarters. HVS is focused on generating new business through the SMB segment of the market as well as with larger enterprise accounts new to AspenTech. With that said, we continue to believe that our engineering suite will remain a prime beneficiary of the positive CapEx outlook for both traditional energy markets and sustainability over the long-term. In Q3, for example, we continue to win deals with owner operators and E&C companies, expanding our business with a long-standing customer, who is one of the world's top EPC firms in response to their increasing backlog in the energy sector and sustainability projects. Turning to our Manufacture & Supply Chain Suite or MSC. In Q3, MSC benefited from the closing of the delayed Q2 transaction and a pickup in sales activity. However, we still saw some deals move out of the quarter. The prolonged downturn in the chemicals industry remains a headwind for MSC, while refining was also an area where we did see some more cautious buying activity in Q3. Nevertheless, we were encouraged by the early uptake of our recently released Aspen Unified Planning product with several customers committing to it in the quarter. Looking ahead, we remain cautious on when a chemicals recovery will return while refiners continue to have a favorable outlook. Our pipeline of business in this area continues to grow with the interest in our multivariable process control DMC3 product, multiunit dynamic optimization GDOT product and comprehensive supply chain optimization solution. Finally, Asset Performance Management or APM performed below expectations in Q3 as several deals moved out of the quarter. The combination of these with higher expected attrition for the full fiscal year means that we do not expect APM to contribute to ACV growth in fiscal 2024. We're in the process of simplifying its go to market strategy since it is now clear to us that there are certain market segments where we're taking a leadership position and APM's return on investment is real, material and quantifiable. We believe this should provide better, more targeted selling opportunities and minimize the risk of future attrition over time. Taking all these factors into account, we now expect our Heritage AspenTech Suite to contribute at least 5.5 points of ACV growth to our fiscal year 2024 results. On Slide 6, I would now like to provide an update on our product and R&D initiatives. R&D and product teams have remained laser focused on the launch of our V14.3 software update, which we plan to release this quarter. Version 14.3 will include updates to our recently launched Aspen Unified Platform, deeper industrial AI integration across our portfolio and more. As an example, this release will include Aspen Virtual Advisor or AVA for Aspen Unified Planning & Scheduling. We have previously released Aspen Virtual Advisor for our DMC3 multivariable process control technology. In Version 14.3, we're introducing AVA to the planning and scheduling area. AVA leverages AI algorithms at its core to help guide users in analyzing and optimizing production plans. We also launched the beta version of our new Aspen Workflow product in Q3 as a shared component for Unified and other solutions. Aspen Workflow allows users to orchestrate workflows and actions across AspenTech and third-party applications for more efficient operational outcomes. This is just one of the many ways we're working to enhance the ability of our users to achieve greater workflow automation in their highly complex operating environments. Finally, we're excited to announce the recent limited availability launch of our Strategic Planning for Sustainability Pathways product, a new and unique integrated modeling and optimization solution that aims to guide companies in carbon capture, use and sequestration decision-making and sustainability strategy investments. By leveraging generative AI capabilities, strategic planning for sustainability pathways help sustainability planners to solve the blank page problem, combining different inputs to generate initial plans for asset carbon reduction. Turning to Slide 7, I would now like to provide some color on our key focus areas for the coming quarters. First, we have several initiatives underway to drive better alignment and complete the onboarding across our sales teams. We're already making progress in these areas to date. Second, we're working to further drive efficiencies and productivity across the entire company to accelerate our path to best-in-class profitability and free cash flow going forward. We are focused on controlling what we can control and believe there are several opportunities rationalize expenses and drive multiyear improvements in productivity. Third, we will continue to make targeted investments into strategically important areas of the business. This includes a special focus in our DGM business given the multiple tailwinds in that space and our continued belief in its significant long-term growth opportunity. Finally, I want to be clear that we feel strongly that our performance in Q3 does not reflect the full potential of the opportunities we're seeing today nor does it reflect any material changes in the long-term underlying strength of our end markets. Our customers remain at the center of several important megatrends, including global decarbonization and electrification, as well as the transition to a new energy system. At the same time, we are dealing with demands to do more with less, while working to address a growing skills gap across their labor forces. As leaders in industrial software, our portfolio remains perfectly situated to help customers navigate these challenges, providing a compelling outlook for future spend with AspenTech. In conclusion, we are taking the necessary steps to drive improvements in areas that are both within our control and able to better position us to achieve our objectives in Q4 and beyond. We are confident that increased focus we now have in place for our expanded sales force combined with the multiple tailwinds we see across most end markets will yield improved ACV growth over time. Before I turn the call over to Chris, I would like to welcome two new members to the AspenTech team. First is our new Chief Financial Officer, David Baker. With a long and successful tenure in senior financial roles at Emerson, Dave comes to the company armed with deep financial acumen and operational expertise in support of our long-term growth objectives. I'm looking forward to my partnership with Dave. I would also like to thank Chris for serving in the interim role over the last 4 months and for everything he has done to maintain our forward trajectory. Thank you, Chris. Secondly, I would like to welcome David Henshall to AspenTech's Board of Directors. Over a long and highly successful career in software, David has accumulated a wealth of knowledge and leadership experience that will prove invaluable to us as we advance organization going forward. Welcome, David. With that, I will turn it over to Chris for a review of our financial results before we open it up for Q&A. Chris?\nChris Stagno: Thank you, Antonio, and hello, everyone. Turning to our Q3 performance, I will start out by highlighting that our earnings presentation includes explanations regarding the impact of ASC Topic 606 on our financial results. We have also included definitions of annual contract value or ACV, bookings and free cash flow among other metrics in our earnings presentation now available on our IR website. We ask that investors refer to these definitions together with today's call. Starting on Slide 8, annual contract value was $936 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, up 9.5% year-over-year and 2.4% quarter-over-quarter. As Antonio mentioned, this included the closing of the large delayed renewal that pushed out from our prior Q2. Total bookings were $301 million in the third quarter, increasing 30% year-over-year, while total revenue was $278 million for the third quarter, increasing 21% year-over-year. Please note that bookings and revenue are heavily impacted by contract renewal timing, while the majority of our revenue is recognized under ASC Topic 606. Now turning to profitability. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported operating income of $116 million in Q3, representing a 41.8% non-GAAP operating margin. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $67 million for a non-GAAP operating margin of 29% a year ago. The year-over-year improvement in our margin profile was mainly driven by a higher mix of license and solutions revenue, in addition to onetime expense savings and a continuing focus on driving efficiencies. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period-to-period due to the timing of customer renewals and the resulting impact on license revenue recognition in a given quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $109 million in the quarter or $1.70 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $69 million or $1.06 per share a year ago. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP net income between periods was mainly due to the combination of solid revenue growth and strong operating leverage. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $178 million of cash and cash equivalents, reflecting the impact of share repurchases under our $300 million share repurchase authorization and $198 million available under our revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 228,000 shares for $57 million under our $300 million share repurchase authorization for fiscal year '24. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares or $243 million under the same authorization, with a total remaining value of $57 million. On cash flows, we generated $138 million of cash flow from operations and $137 million of free cash flow in Q3, compared to $131 million in cash flow from operations and $129 million in free cash flow a year ago. Turning to Slide 9, I would now like to close with guidance. As Antonio mentioned, we now expect to achieve ACV growth of at least 9% in fiscal 2024. We expect total bookings of at least $1.03 billion with $580 million up for renewal in fiscal 2024 and $195 million up for renewal in Q4. We expect total revenue of at least $1.1 billion GAAP net loss at or better than $29 million and non-GAAP net income of at least $403 million. From a cash flow perspective, we expect operating cash flow of at least $349 million and free cash flow of at least $340 million. For a complete overview of our updated fiscal year 2024 guidance, please refer to our earnings presentation slides now available on our IR website. In closing, we recognize that our year-to-date performance has not met our expectations and we are committed to implementing the necessary actions to improve our performance going forward. As Antonio mentioned, we now have several different initiatives in place that we are confident will help us address these different areas. Additionally, we are making steady progress toward our return to best-in-class profitability and free cash flow generation. With that, I will turn the call back to Antonio for his closing remarks. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks, Chris. As I mentioned earlier, we have adjusted our guide for fiscal year 2024 in response to the dynamics we faced in Q3 and our measure expectations for this quarter. We're actively monitoring and engaged with our customers to confirm their spending plans and ensure a successful Q4 outcome. More broadly, we remain excited about the strength of our software portfolio and its ability to help our customers run their assets more efficiently and sustainably. We look forward to closing out this fiscal year on a positive note with a focus on execution following our recent expansion initiatives. With that, we'll open it up to questions. Josh?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nJason Celino: I think the question on everyone's minds is relative to maybe last quarter, especially for the Heritage business, like what specifically changed? I mean, where kind of particularly was the downtick? And then, at what point in the quarter did you start to kind of feel it?\nAntonio Pietri : Well, I mean, look, we maintained very good conversations and engagement with our customers basically through the beginning of March. We started to see things start to turn into the 2nd week of March and especially the last two weeks of March as our teams started to drive the closing process with these customers on the different deals and what we expected to be final approval didn't happen or reasons to extend beyond the quarter. So I would say it came down to the last three weeks of the quarter, mainly the last two weeks. As you well know, most of our business comes down to the last weeks of the quarter, and this is where we saw the push out materialize. What I will say about that, as I said in my remarks, it was broad based across all of our regions and impacted most of our product suites to a lesser extent DGM because it's driven by different dynamics, but it was very consistent and in a way also surprising.\nJason Celino: And then just when I think about the Q4 guidance, usually when we look at the sequential change between Q3 and Q4 for ACV, it looks like the implied kind of, increase is kind of consistent with what we saw last year on like on a growth basis. So I guess what I'm asking is, what's baked in from like a conservatism standpoint? Like is there anything that we should be aware of on deals that maybe didn't close this quarter, but you feel good about closing next quarter? Anything you can kind of say there?\nAntonio Pietri : Yes. Well, let me look, we've had a strong conviction about the fiscal year. We said as much in the Q2 earnings call in January, early February. We have a very strong pipeline of business. We have some very interesting deals in that pipeline. Q4 and our guide is based on very specific conversations we're having with customers around very specific set of deals across all of our regions is where we are confirming and we have confirmed with customers not only that they have a budget, because we believe budgets are in place, but they're intent to spend. And I think we need to differentiate between budgets and intent to spend. I think what we saw in Q3 was budgets in place, but the intent to spend got pushed out. And so our Q4 outlook and guidance is based on engagement with customers. There were many conversations had at optimize last week and what we're guiding to is reflects those conversations and an analysis of our pipeline. I have personally done a top to bottom review of our sales activity with every one of our frontline sales leaders, area sales managers, area sales directors. That's something that already happened the week before optimize and that will happen again here. And as such the guidance that we have provided.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Hi. This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. Could you add a little more color around DGM's pipeline, those comments you had, just relative size, how that's developing, your confidence in kind of the knowing that there's an elongated sales cycle, but your confidence in those closing in this fiscal year?\nAntonio Pietri : Yes, sure. Look, first and foremost, we just told you that we believe that DGM will grow approximately 2.5 points or will contribute 2.5 points of growth to our guide of 9. 2.5 points of growth for DGM, puts DGM at somewhere around the range of 40% growth for the year, the suite. Last year that suite grew 30%. So we do believe we have different dynamics around DGM. These are utilities, government owned, whether it's a municipality, a state or across multiple states. So they're driven by the need to upgrade and expand the grid cybersecurity. So their spend has different drivers and motivations. When we first our pipeline continues to grow in DGM. We've expanded our sales organization into Europe. We have started an expansion into Asia Pacific now and in the Middle East. But that pipeline when we go into a customer and we replace an existing system, that's a 12 to 24-month sales cycle, because it's a very rigorous procurement process that happens tied to government regulations. Now, once we are in there, there's upgrades and new applications that get deployed and the sales cycle then tends to be shorter 6 to 12 months. So, our pipeline is a combination of these longer sales cycle deals and the shorter sales cycle upgrades and add-ons, if you will. We like what we see. We like the progress that we're making. We like the investment thesis behind the utilities industry and the continued commitment of funds to upgrade the grid, and we believe we'll continue to benefit from all of that. Of course, we did a reset of the OSI sales team. Even in North America. We've put in a new sales team into Europe. We're going to put a new sales team into Asia Pacific. There's a lot of learning that has to happen in the sales teams, onboarding and institutionalization if you will around how we do business in AspenTech to deliver the quality of growth and profitability that we're accustomed to. So it takes time to onboard these people and make sure they're producing at the level of productivity that we expect. Nonetheless, the Q3 quarter for DGM was a good quarter. There were a couple of deals that slipped into Q4, but that's more timing than anything due to the procurement processes that those customers follow. But overall, we remain very excited about our DGM business.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: And as a follow-up, a lot of the kind of commentary you have here is that if you will, most calendar year budgets for your clients are flat to up. But given your fiscal year-end in June, more of that spend is likely to happen in fiscal 2025 versus fiscal 2024, would you say there's sort of a, if you look at it on a 12-month view, there's been a significant change in your outlook for ACV additions?\nAntonio Pietri : Yes. I mean, look at and I appreciate your question sort of comment all wrapped into one. Look, I think it is important that I don't mean to split hairs here, but there is budgets and then there is intent to spend. If you look at the macro indicators that we track, oil prices, refining margins, CapEx spend in oil and gas, CapEx spend around sustainability, all those indicators are flashing green. I mean, oil prices have fluctuated between $70 and $90, $95. Refining margins came down a little bit in the March quarter, but very still solid. And we're now going into the driving season in the summer here in the United States, so margins should improve for refiners. The CapEx spending in electrification continue to. So, all those indicators are green and we believe that our customers have put in place budgets that are in line with what they deployed in '23, perhaps even a little bit better in some cases around oil and gas CapEx. And now the intent to spend, I think, it has to do more with uncertainty around the macro environment, whether that is interest rates or anything else. And if you look at the results that our customers are in hat, that our customers in heritage has been taken have posted the oil and gas companies, chemical companies, you can understand why perhaps there was a slowdown in spending in the quarter in order to support better results in light of lower revenue, lower profitability, driven by lower oil prices and margins in refining and the challenges around chemicals. So the question then is, okay, is it a temporary slowdown in spending? Does it go into Q4 or the remainder of the year? We don't know that. What we're working on and doing is now very rigorously engaged with our customers to make sure that if our champion or sponsor says, yes, we're going to do a deal that when he goes up to the CFO and CEO for approval that it is approved, because we saw some of that in the Q3 quarter. A strong willingness to do business by our champions and sponsors with approvals and then some deals that got rejected at the CFO, CEO level to the surprise of everyone, including our champions and sponsors. So I think this is a different dynamic. I think budgets are in there, frankly oil prices at $80, $90 or $70 are equally healthy, but the results reported by our customers for the March quarter certainly lead me to think as well that what we saw was just a premeditated pullback on spending.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird.\nRob Oliver: Two questions. I guess the first one for me is around the sales related issues. I know you just enumerated some of those issues on the previous question, but it just seems like a lot coming on here in the back half of the year. So as you're approaching your FY '25, you look at the sales challenges, what's been done and what's fixed and what still remains to be done? And are you confident that you'll have that straightened out ahead of FY '25 kind of sales kick off and everything? And then I had a follow-up question.\nAntonio Pietri : I mean, first of all, Rob, I already conducted a couple of reviews, one of the with the regional sales leaders and area and group leaders right after the quarter ended and then one a couple of weeks ago with the first line leaders for sales. And part of my objective was also to understand what are the challenges and opportunities that they see. We've come up with a very specific set of opportunities that we've put actions around them. Of course, first and foremost, when you have a lot of new sales people in the organization, it starts with their affinity for what customers are telling them, their ability to read the signals that customers are giving them or not, including their own body language when they're meeting with them. So we're certainly deploying a lot of our more experienced people on the deal that we believe we need to close in Q4, because one, it will help them accelerate their understanding of learning, but also it will give us greater assurance of what's coming back as a deal that have the opportunity to close Israel. Look, this isn't something that I think it's the regular process of sales people when they join a company and are learning. But we also have a lot of experienced people in the company that have been here selling for 15, 20, 25 years. So we're taking a much more rigorous approach around partnering and reviewing of the deals. We're also then looking at accelerating the onboarding, making sure that all the training that needs to happen, happens as quickly as possible and more specifically this quarter before we go into the new fiscal year and our new and our sales kickoff meeting in mid July for fiscal 2025. We don't want to wait until the sales kickoff meeting to bring to closure all the onboarding that has to happen, including what are our crown jewels when we're negotiating deals, including what are those terms and conditions in our agreements that are most important to us. Again, to maintain the high quality of business that we generate that supports the profitability that we drive in order to avoid the elongation of negotiations and then many other activities. I think the action plan is very clear. I think also there's some alignment that needs to happen when you have new people that are still learning their way around the organization. So we're also working to facilitate some of that. But I think, look, we've been onboarding people here for the last 12 months, 12, 18 months. The European DGM team was put in place pretty much in the middle of last year. There's newer people that got on boarded in Q1, Q2 and even some in Q3. So we're just working to make sure that we get everyone on the same page, going forward. But I'm optimistic. This is what we're supposed to do and we'll get it done.\nRob Oliver: And then just a quick follow-up and I think we're all going at this question in ways, so it's a bit repetitive. But when I look at the breakdown of your business, you guys actually did a nice job forecasting the DGM and SSE businesses, although little weakness in SSE, which you called out, but DGM essentially came in line. So the bulk of the reduction in a pretty significant reduction at ACV is actually coming from or if I had isolated just that portion of the slide deck that said, hey, that MSC deal that was hadn't closed, I would have thought, okay, we're out of it here. We're in a good spot. So but even with that deal closing, things got much worse. So I think we're focused here, but was it more kind of at the midpoint in the year just sort of hoping that these deals would get through amid some troubling signs or was it something that like changed dramatically in the macro, because it seems a pretty significant amount in your core which is clearly the business that you guys know best?\nAntonio Pietri : I mean, Rob, I think we've always emphasized that one of the challenges that we have with our fiscal year is that it starts on July 1st in the middle of fiscal budget for our customers. And then come January 1st, it's a new fiscal year for our customers, while we're still in the middle of our fiscal year, we normally just finished the second quarter. I think we saw good activity in Q1 and Q2. We always said that our fiscal year was going to be back end loaded, meaning to the second half of the year. And then we come into the new calendar year, new fiscal year for our customers, our Q3 quarter and customers deploy new budgets, but also their intent to spend or not clearly wasn't targeted at the March quarter. This is why I want to be very clear that we need to differentiate between budgets and spending. So I think what's happening here is we always said this was going to be back end loaded. We came into Q3 with great expectations, a great pipeline, a great visibility into deals. I said as much in the early February earnings call, and we got caught by surprise by the spending decisions of our customers. This is a challenge that we have with how our fiscal year lays out. In some case, some years, it's been positive, some years it's been neutral and other years it's been a surprise and I think that's what happened this time around the latter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dylan Becker with William Blair.\nDylan Becker : Maybe kind of double clicking on the pipeline strength and being more calendar year versus fiscal year. Any kind of incremental takeaways from the conference last week and your customer conversations that help kind of validate that conference. I think it was the first time you guys were able to kind of show the full strength of the combined Aspen and Emerson approach. So maybe some customer takeaways that help kind of support that intent to spend initiative.\nAntonio Pietri : Yes. Well, let me look. First of all, the incredible feedback from customers about the conference. The value proposition, our strategy, the opportunity that they see and the challenges that they have and how AspenTech is incredibly well lined up across all of that. So, it was really a moment of a high and that was great to see. Look, we also had great customer meetings around just new relationships, developed extending existing relationships and also specific deals. If you look at what happened, we had close to 1,200, 1,300 customers, our DGM plenary, which happened on Monday, was a standing room only plenary. We had seats for 550 people. We believe we got in there about 650. Part of that was due to customers from other industries interested on the DGM solutions to understand their applicability into their industries, whether it's refining, chemicals, mining. It was a sight to see to have that standing room on the plenary. We got great feedback from customers in DGM about the opportunity to take some of our artificial intelligence capabilities, our optimization capabilities, our control capabilities from our Heritage AspenTech Industries, refining chemicals into our utility solutions to enhance the value creation for them and resiliency of the grid. If you look at also the sessions that we had, one of the main points of feedback that we received is that some of our customers were frustrated, because there were so many sessions that they wanted to attend that were happening at the same time. So they were asking us to see find a way to extend the conference next time, so that they can attend more sessions. And this just speaks to the wealth of technology that now exists inside AspenTech that are so relevant to the challenges and opportunities that these customers are facing. So look, I said it in my plenary presentation, I've never been as excited about the future of this company as I am today. I came out of the conference even more convinced about that feeling and statement. And I think we have to work our way through this moment that we encounter in Q3. We have to certainly finish up some of the transformation initiatives that we're working on. And now that we have in place a sales team, because we now have it in place, We're only expanding sales in DGM to move into Asia and the Middle East. We're going to focus on solidifying the execution of the sales team, making sure that it's performing at the excellent level that we have traditionally performed in AspenTech, and I can only see positive going forward. But certainly, this has been a more challenging year than I expected than we expected in the company. But I just see these as a bump on the road and absolutely doesn't change our future trajectory whatsoever.\nDylan Becker : Maybe sticking internally as you guys kind of think about the expense management side of the equation as well too. I know you called out the opportunity to rationalize and realize productivity gains. You're now 2 years into that Emerson integration. I guess I wonder where or how you're seeing kind of the most readily apparent opportunities there that haven't been realized already and maybe what's more kind of the long-term structural shift? I know sales will be a component of that and sales efficiency, but thinking about kind of the broader cost structure as well.\nAntonio Pietri : Well, I mean, look, certainly, and we said it in the prepared remarks, I think one of the big opportunities that will now and we're already working on and we'll continue to work on here is efficiencies and productivity. When you have three companies coming together and really three and a small one in nation, there will always be opportunities to drive efficiencies as you simplify it, as you streamline the organization. So we're very much focused on that and including onetime expenses sort of non-compensation expenses, because as always, if you want to be a best-in-class profitability company, you have to do more with less and as a culture that we're building here and as part of the focus on efficiencies that we're driving and we'll continue to drive. From a productivity standpoint, it's always been my north star. You get to that profitability level is that really doing more with less on headcount and driving to maximum productivity. It's a multiyear journey, because you cannot just, it's not a binary 0 to 1. As you drive improvements and exercise your muscles, you get feeder and feeder. So this is why I said it was a multiyear journey to the productivity that we want to get to, but as you drive that productivity, you can grow and spending less, which then starts expanding profitability and free cash flow going forward. I know one of the things that we are giving credit for was in the early phases of my tenure in AspenTech when we maintained flat expenses for 4 years in this company and we drove incredible increases in profitability. And I believe that's possible. So I hear as well in the new aspect. So we're going to be focusing on all that much more rigorously. And in the meantime, we'll build our, we'll optimize our sales muscle and I'm sure we'll find ourselves in the right place here pretty soon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Clark Jefferies with Piper Sandler.\nClark Jefferies: Antonio, I think you've really shaped a lot of the description around budget versus spending intent. But I really wanted to, I think, put in that final piece of the discussion around, are these deals primarily lost to no decision or later decision more than anything else? And I think the final part of that is, I didn't see it in the presentation, but want to be explicit. Is attrition trending as you expected? Is the rough 5% number still the applicable number when you think about this commentary around expansion versus retention of ACV? And I have one follow-up.\nAntonio Pietri : No, great point. No, look, our attrition is in line with what we guided for the year, about 5 points of attrition. Of course, we've had this large deal that we renewed in Q2, it's now in Q3 that produced a big bump of attrition. Excluding that deal, our attrition is in line because we've now closed that deal, so that was a net neutral deal, if you will. But no, attrition is fine and we believe we have very good side into that attrition in Q4 as well. Look, it's an interesting dynamic, because while a lot of engineering business got pushed out of the quarter, our E&C customers are expanding spending with AspenTech. We signed a number of transactions in the quarter, especially one of our largest E&Cs, where they expanded their spend with AspenTech by an incremental percentage, which is a sizable number in the context of their deal of the spend they already have with AspenTech. We're seeing these the same behavior across more and more E&Cs. So I don't think it's a CapEx related issue, because CapEx is a long term investment by these customers. I think this is a temporary pullback on OpEx spending that impacts on short-term deals in engineering and MSC and APM. The dynamic that we saw in APM is very typical of the dynamic that we saw during the pandemic in that pullback on OpEx, maintenance being a very discretionary area of spending. And even if you have deals that have already been signed, if they come up for renewal, we've also seen those customers give up on those on those agreements in order to save that spend. So overall, it's a combination of behavior that support the macro, the positive flashing green indicators that we have, but also what was clearly a pullback on spending in the quarter.\nClark Jefferies: And I think just the last point on this about really being March being the timeframe where you started to see some of these impacts to sort of closing times. Just as you sort of frame up across all the segments April and where we are into May, have you seen any definable improvement, especially maybe in the wake of optimize? And if there is any amount of reminder you can give us around how much of the business in ACV terms closes in the last month? That'd be incredibly helpful.\nAntonio Pietri : Well, I mean, we're a typical software company in that regard in that most of our business closes in the last month, okay. And you can ask any software company and they'll probably give you numbers somewhere around 50%, 75% of the business closing in the last month of the quarter. That's just how sales cycles work. And now I'll say, and this is just a commentary, we've already closed good business in the April month, a lot of it tied to the Q4, to the Q2 to Q3 deals that we were pursuing. But there's also some business in Q3 that has moved into Q1. But what I'll also say is that, hardly ever those deals disappear from our pipeline, like a customer didn't want to do business and the deal falls off of the pipeline. It gets pushed out into the future and most of the business that pushed out of Q3 is in Q4 or some of it in Q1.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Schappel with Loop Capital Markets.\nMark Schappel: In your prepared remarks, you noted that you were reviewing your APM segment as a result of the segment's underperformance in the quarter. And you may have touched on this a little bit in the prior question, but I was wondering if you could just provide some additional details around your APM segment and what you're doing there.\nAntonio Pietri : Yes, yes. Look, Mark, the fact is that our APM business, especially our Mtell product, is a great product. I think Mtell has been given 5 or 6 awards as best technology or AI, IoT, whatever since the very beginning. I mean in almost every region of the world, Mtell has gotten a best technology award by hydrocarbon processing, by conferences. Frankly, it's a little bit incredible, the recognition that our products receive. So okay, a lot has happened with Mtell and APM. What we're clearly seeing is that the value proposition for Mtell is incredibly clear, quantifiable and material to, in some customer segments. To the extent that we see very little attrition in those customer segments. So these customers buy the technology deployed and expanded. So we have we have some customers already with the technology across 20, 25 sites generating incredible value. And I'm not going to mention what customer segments because I'm sure the competition is probably listening. But at the same time, we have some customer segments where customers love the technology. They buy, they implement it and for whatever reason, a year or 2 later, either their teams move on, get promoted, leave the company, and the value hasn't really been proven and quantified, and therefore, there isn't a commitment to sustaining the use of the technology. That is what generates attrition. So the product and Mtell and APM, they've never stop generating growth. The fact is that every quarter, there's an important amount of gross growth, new growth that gets generated that is negated then by some attrition. So in this review that we've done, and it's part of the outcome of the reviews that I've been involved in is clearly that if we sharpen our focus with Mtell and APM, we can go into some customer segments where we will be very successful with the product, where we will see very little attrition, and therefore, the net growth will be more material and a contributor to our overall growth as a company. So that's what we're doing. For fiscal '25, we're going to sharpen our strategy, we're going to be very focused and we're going to pursue not business for the sake of business, but high-quality business that doesn't generate attrition later on. And we believe we have a number of customer segments. I can tell you, we believe we're becoming the leader with Mtell in some of those customer segments by far. And those customers that are already using it, they just love the technology.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Antonio Pietri for any closing remarks.\nAntonio Pietri: All right. Thank you, Josh, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. We will be attending the Baird Technology Conference and the William Blair Growth Conference in the first week of June. So please reach out to our Investor Relations team for more information on this event. We look forward to catching up with many of you soon. So thank you, everyone, for joining and we will see you on the road. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Stagno",
            "content": "Thank you, Antonio, and hello, everyone. Turning to our Q3 performance, I will start out by highlighting that our earnings presentation includes explanations regarding the impact of ASC Topic 606 on our financial results. We have also included definitions of annual contract value or ACV, bookings and free cash flow among other metrics in our earnings presentation now available on our IR website. We ask that investors refer to these definitions together with today's call. Starting on Slide 8, annual contract value was $936 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, up 9.5% year-over-year and 2.4% quarter-over-quarter. As Antonio mentioned, this included the closing of the large delayed renewal that pushed out from our prior Q2. Total bookings were $301 million in the third quarter, increasing 30% year-over-year, while total revenue was $278 million for the third quarter, increasing 21% year-over-year. Please note that bookings and revenue are heavily impacted by contract renewal timing, while the majority of our revenue is recognized under ASC Topic 606. Now turning to profitability. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported operating income of $116 million in Q3, representing a 41.8% non-GAAP operating margin. This compares to non-GAAP operating income of $67 million for a non-GAAP operating margin of 29% a year ago. The year-over-year improvement in our margin profile was mainly driven by a higher mix of license and solutions revenue, in addition to onetime expense savings and a continuing focus on driving efficiencies. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period-to-period due to the timing of customer renewals and the resulting impact on license revenue recognition in a given quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $109 million in the quarter or $1.70 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $69 million or $1.06 per share a year ago. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP net income between periods was mainly due to the combination of solid revenue growth and strong operating leverage. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $178 million of cash and cash equivalents, reflecting the impact of share repurchases under our $300 million share repurchase authorization and $198 million available under our revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 228,000 shares for $57 million under our $300 million share repurchase authorization for fiscal year '24. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares or $243 million under the same authorization, with a total remaining value of $57 million. On cash flows, we generated $138 million of cash flow from operations and $137 million of free cash flow in Q3, compared to $131 million in cash flow from operations and $129 million in free cash flow a year ago. Turning to Slide 9, I would now like to close with guidance. As Antonio mentioned, we now expect to achieve ACV growth of at least 9% in fiscal 2024. We expect total bookings of at least $1.03 billion with $580 million up for renewal in fiscal 2024 and $195 million up for renewal in Q4. We expect total revenue of at least $1.1 billion GAAP net loss at or better than $29 million and non-GAAP net income of at least $403 million. From a cash flow perspective, we expect operating cash flow of at least $349 million and free cash flow of at least $340 million. For a complete overview of our updated fiscal year 2024 guidance, please refer to our earnings presentation slides now available on our IR website. In closing, we recognize that our year-to-date performance has not met our expectations and we are committed to implementing the necessary actions to improve our performance going forward. As Antonio mentioned, we now have several different initiatives in place that we are confident will help us address these different areas. Additionally, we are making steady progress toward our return to best-in-class profitability and free cash flow generation. With that, I will turn the call back to Antonio for his closing remarks.

            "name": "Antonio Pietri",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and welcome to everyone joining us today. Before I get into our results, I would like to highlight our flagship optimize user conference, which we held last week in Houston, Texas with a theme of Partnering for the Future. This was the first time that the new AspenTech organization has held an optimized event, and we were pleased to see many new and familiar faces in attendance. More than ever, our customers are focused on addressing the dual challenge of meeting the increasing demand for resources from a growing population with an increasing standard of living, while also addressing the sustainability imperative. At its core, this requires leading the organizations through a transformation that will require a heavy investment in digitalization and new technologies to meet performance, resiliency and sustainability objectives. We believe the strong customer attendance and discussions held at the conference are representative of the opportunity available to AspenTech in the future. Now turning to Slide 3 for our Q3 results. We remain incredibly excited about the market opportunity we're seeing as reflected in the ongoing and healthy growth of our pipeline. That said, the volume of business closed in the quarter did not meet our expectations or reflect the opportunity available to us. Annual contract value or ACV was $936 million in Q3, increasing 2.4% quarter-over-quarter and 9.5% year-over-year and included the closing of the delayed renewal agreement that I had referenced on our prior Q2 earnings call. Free cash flow was $137 million in Q3. The lower than expected ACV growth in the quarter was driven by what we believe was a slow start to budget deployments by customers in their new fiscal year, and secondarily and to a much lesser degree, our maturing sales organization. On the customer side, while customers remained engaged throughout the quarter on exciting value creation opportunities and discussions, ultimately their conviction to close business in the quarter waned in the last month. We saw closing timelines extend beyond the quarter exercise more caution in final purchasing decisions. These dynamics were prevalent across most regions and end markets in the quarter. We believe this reflected customers' need for additional time to evaluate their own end markets and budgetary allocations in the context of uncertainty created by a dynamic macro environment. That said, customers continue to communicate that their budgets are generally consistent with those of calendar 2023 and we're also seeing that strength exhibited in our pipeline. We continue to monitor this dynamic closely and are doing everything within our control to drive faster decision making to meet our sales goals. On the sales side, we saw some instances where our sales execution was below our expectations as we continue to onboard our expanded sales team and institutionalize best practices. Over the past 12 to 18 months, we have put in place new sales leadership, expanded our overall sales team and adjusted sales coverage for a significant portion of our customer base. We believe the combination of a still maturing sales team and a more cautious spending environment created some missed opportunities in Q3. We remain confident the investments and changes made to our sales organization will best position us to fully capitalize on our long-term growth opportunity. While we cannot control spending caution among global customers, we can actively address those things that we can control. To that end, in the near-term, we are working to drive full alignment across and return our sales execution and predictability to the level that we expect of ourselves as a high performance organization. Considering our Q3 performance, we are lowering our ACV growth outlook to at least 9.9% in fiscal year 2024. We believe this target is prudent when considering the dynamic we saw in Q3. We're also updating our fiscal year 2024 free cash flow guide to at least $340 million, which is mainly a function of softer net new ACV in Q3. Chris will provide more color on our financials in his remarks. With that said, I will now turn to Slide 4 to provide an update on our suite's performances in Q3 as well as our updated expectations for fiscal year 2024. Starting with Digital Grid Management or DGM, this suite saw continued strength in demand and signed several term license wins in Q3, as we continue to expand wallet share with existing customers and win new loads. During the quarter, for example, we won a large distribution management and optimization deal in North America, beating the competition across nearly all evaluation categories including compliance, technology, security and performance. Overall, we continue to be excited about the outlook and prospects for this suite. Demand for our grid innovation remains strong as the acceleration of global electrification and prioritization of energy security drives an unprecedented investment cycle to update and modernize the grid. The combination of these funding tailwinds and the strength of our grid technology is helping to drive a strong term pipeline growth for DGM both in the United States and international markets. Separately, as we've mentioned in the past, utility customers have a materially different and longer procurement process than our older customer segments. We continue to make progress in refining and strengthening our sales forecasting in this area considering the purchasing process characteristics associated with these deals. Overall, we are pleased with DGM's year-to-date performance and it remains on track to deliver approximately 2.5 points of growth for our fiscal year 2024. Subsurface Science & Engineering or SSE had a softer quarter. In Q3, SSE had its largest block of contracts up for renewal. This backdrop combined with the two factors I laid out at the top of the call resulted in deals that pushed out of the quarter and more muted growth. We now expect to close many of these deals this quarter. With that said, the backdrop for SSE customers remains strong with solid CapEx and operating budgets in place for the remainder of the calendar year. In Q3, for example, we further expanded our existing SSE business with a national oil company in Latin America. This customer values the strength of our seismic technology and has shown significant interest in converting to tokenization down the road to access our entire portfolio of subsurface innovation more easily. Taking all these into consideration, we now expect approximately one point of growth from SSE in our fiscal year 2024. Turning to Slide 5 and our Heritage AspenTech Suites. This is the part of the business where the two drivers I laid out regarding our Q3 performance were most notable. Engineering saw a significant number of deals pushed out of the quarter across all regions, marking a slowdown from the Suite's prior accelerated levels in the first half. This was more prevalent in our High Velocity Sales or HVS organization, which is one of the areas where we have increased our sales headcount significantly over the past several quarters. HVS is focused on generating new business through the SMB segment of the market as well as with larger enterprise accounts new to AspenTech. With that said, we continue to believe that our engineering suite will remain a prime beneficiary of the positive CapEx outlook for both traditional energy markets and sustainability over the long-term. In Q3, for example, we continue to win deals with owner operators and E&C companies, expanding our business with a long-standing customer, who is one of the world's top EPC firms in response to their increasing backlog in the energy sector and sustainability projects. Turning to our Manufacture & Supply Chain Suite or MSC. In Q3, MSC benefited from the closing of the delayed Q2 transaction and a pickup in sales activity. However, we still saw some deals move out of the quarter. The prolonged downturn in the chemicals industry remains a headwind for MSC, while refining was also an area where we did see some more cautious buying activity in Q3. Nevertheless, we were encouraged by the early uptake of our recently released Aspen Unified Planning product with several customers committing to it in the quarter. Looking ahead, we remain cautious on when a chemicals recovery will return while refiners continue to have a favorable outlook. Our pipeline of business in this area continues to grow with the interest in our multivariable process control DMC3 product, multiunit dynamic optimization GDOT product and comprehensive supply chain optimization solution. Finally, Asset Performance Management or APM performed below expectations in Q3 as several deals moved out of the quarter. The combination of these with higher expected attrition for the full fiscal year means that we do not expect APM to contribute to ACV growth in fiscal 2024. We're in the process of simplifying its go to market strategy since it is now clear to us that there are certain market segments where we're taking a leadership position and APM's return on investment is real, material and quantifiable. We believe this should provide better, more targeted selling opportunities and minimize the risk of future attrition over time. Taking all these factors into account, we now expect our Heritage AspenTech Suite to contribute at least 5.5 points of ACV growth to our fiscal year 2024 results. On Slide 6, I would now like to provide an update on our product and R&D initiatives. R&D and product teams have remained laser focused on the launch of our V14.3 software update, which we plan to release this quarter. Version 14.3 will include updates to our recently launched Aspen Unified Platform, deeper industrial AI integration across our portfolio and more. As an example, this release will include Aspen Virtual Advisor or AVA for Aspen Unified Planning & Scheduling. We have previously released Aspen Virtual Advisor for our DMC3 multivariable process control technology. In Version 14.3, we're introducing AVA to the planning and scheduling area. AVA leverages AI algorithms at its core to help guide users in analyzing and optimizing production plans. We also launched the beta version of our new Aspen Workflow product in Q3 as a shared component for Unified and other solutions. Aspen Workflow allows users to orchestrate workflows and actions across AspenTech and third-party applications for more efficient operational outcomes. This is just one of the many ways we're working to enhance the ability of our users to achieve greater workflow automation in their highly complex operating environments. Finally, we're excited to announce the recent limited availability launch of our Strategic Planning for Sustainability Pathways product, a new and unique integrated modeling and optimization solution that aims to guide companies in carbon capture, use and sequestration decision-making and sustainability strategy investments. By leveraging generative AI capabilities, strategic planning for sustainability pathways help sustainability planners to solve the blank page problem, combining different inputs to generate initial plans for asset carbon reduction. Turning to Slide 7, I would now like to provide some color on our key focus areas for the coming quarters. First, we have several initiatives underway to drive better alignment and complete the onboarding across our sales teams. We're already making progress in these areas to date. Second, we're working to further drive efficiencies and productivity across the entire company to accelerate our path to best-in-class profitability and free cash flow going forward. We are focused on controlling what we can control and believe there are several opportunities rationalize expenses and drive multiyear improvements in productivity. Third, we will continue to make targeted investments into strategically important areas of the business. This includes a special focus in our DGM business given the multiple tailwinds in that space and our continued belief in its significant long-term growth opportunity. Finally, I want to be clear that we feel strongly that our performance in Q3 does not reflect the full potential of the opportunities we're seeing today nor does it reflect any material changes in the long-term underlying strength of our end markets. Our customers remain at the center of several important megatrends, including global decarbonization and electrification, as well as the transition to a new energy system. At the same time, we are dealing with demands to do more with less, while working to address a growing skills gap across their labor forces. As leaders in industrial software, our portfolio remains perfectly situated to help customers navigate these challenges, providing a compelling outlook for future spend with AspenTech. In conclusion, we are taking the necessary steps to drive improvements in areas that are both within our control and able to better position us to achieve our objectives in Q4 and beyond. We are confident that increased focus we now have in place for our expanded sales force combined with the multiple tailwinds we see across most end markets will yield improved ACV growth over time. Before I turn the call over to Chris, I would like to welcome two new members to the AspenTech team. First is our new Chief Financial Officer, David Baker. With a long and successful tenure in senior financial roles at Emerson, Dave comes to the company armed with deep financial acumen and operational expertise in support of our long-term growth objectives. I'm looking forward to my partnership with Dave. I would also like to thank Chris for serving in the interim role over the last 4 months and for everything he has done to maintain our forward trajectory. Thank you, Chris. Secondly, I would like to welcome David Henshall to AspenTech's Board of Directors. Over a long and highly successful career in software, David has accumulated a wealth of knowledge and leadership experience that will prove invaluable to us as we advance organization going forward. Welcome, David. With that, I will turn it over to Chris for a review of our financial results before we open it up for Q&A. Chris? Thanks, Chris. As I mentioned earlier, we have adjusted our guide for fiscal year 2024 in response to the dynamics we faced in Q3 and our measure expectations for this quarter. We're actively monitoring and engaged with our customers to confirm their spending plans and ensure a successful Q4 outcome. More broadly, we remain excited about the strength of our software portfolio and its ability to help our customers run their assets more efficiently and sustainably. We look forward to closing out this fiscal year on a positive note with a focus on execution following our recent expansion initiatives. With that, we'll open it up to questions. Josh? Well, I mean, look, we maintained very good conversations and engagement with our customers basically through the beginning of March. We started to see things start to turn into the 2nd week of March and especially the last two weeks of March as our teams started to drive the closing process with these customers on the different deals and what we expected to be final approval didn't happen or reasons to extend beyond the quarter. So I would say it came down to the last three weeks of the quarter, mainly the last two weeks. As you well know, most of our business comes down to the last weeks of the quarter, and this is where we saw the push out materialize. What I will say about that, as I said in my remarks, it was broad based across all of our regions and impacted most of our product suites to a lesser extent DGM because it's driven by different dynamics, but it was very consistent and in a way also surprising. Yes. Well, let me look, we've had a strong conviction about the fiscal year. We said as much in the Q2 earnings call in January, early February. We have a very strong pipeline of business. We have some very interesting deals in that pipeline. Q4 and our guide is based on very specific conversations we're having with customers around very specific set of deals across all of our regions is where we are confirming and we have confirmed with customers not only that they have a budget, because we believe budgets are in place, but they're intent to spend. And I think we need to differentiate between budgets and intent to spend. I think what we saw in Q3 was budgets in place, but the intent to spend got pushed out. And so our Q4 outlook and guidance is based on engagement with customers. There were many conversations had at optimize last week and what we're guiding to is reflects those conversations and an analysis of our pipeline. I have personally done a top to bottom review of our sales activity with every one of our frontline sales leaders, area sales managers, area sales directors. That's something that already happened the week before optimize and that will happen again here. And as such the guidance that we have provided. Yes, sure. Look, first and foremost, we just told you that we believe that DGM will grow approximately 2.5 points or will contribute 2.5 points of growth to our guide of 9. 2.5 points of growth for DGM, puts DGM at somewhere around the range of 40% growth for the year, the suite. Last year that suite grew 30%. So we do believe we have different dynamics around DGM. These are utilities, government owned, whether it's a municipality, a state or across multiple states. So they're driven by the need to upgrade and expand the grid cybersecurity. So their spend has different drivers and motivations. When we first our pipeline continues to grow in DGM. We've expanded our sales organization into Europe. We have started an expansion into Asia Pacific now and in the Middle East. But that pipeline when we go into a customer and we replace an existing system, that's a 12 to 24-month sales cycle, because it's a very rigorous procurement process that happens tied to government regulations. Now, once we are in there, there's upgrades and new applications that get deployed and the sales cycle then tends to be shorter 6 to 12 months. So, our pipeline is a combination of these longer sales cycle deals and the shorter sales cycle upgrades and add-ons, if you will. We like what we see. We like the progress that we're making. We like the investment thesis behind the utilities industry and the continued commitment of funds to upgrade the grid, and we believe we'll continue to benefit from all of that. Of course, we did a reset of the OSI sales team. Even in North America. We've put in a new sales team into Europe. We're going to put a new sales team into Asia Pacific. There's a lot of learning that has to happen in the sales teams, onboarding and institutionalization if you will around how we do business in AspenTech to deliver the quality of growth and profitability that we're accustomed to. So it takes time to onboard these people and make sure they're producing at the level of productivity that we expect. Nonetheless, the Q3 quarter for DGM was a good quarter. There were a couple of deals that slipped into Q4, but that's more timing than anything due to the procurement processes that those customers follow. But overall, we remain very excited about our DGM business. Yes. I mean, look at and I appreciate your question sort of comment all wrapped into one. Look, I think it is important that I don't mean to split hairs here, but there is budgets and then there is intent to spend. If you look at the macro indicators that we track, oil prices, refining margins, CapEx spend in oil and gas, CapEx spend around sustainability, all those indicators are flashing green. I mean, oil prices have fluctuated between $70 and $90, $95. Refining margins came down a little bit in the March quarter, but very still solid. And we're now going into the driving season in the summer here in the United States, so margins should improve for refiners. The CapEx spending in electrification continue to. So, all those indicators are green and we believe that our customers have put in place budgets that are in line with what they deployed in '23, perhaps even a little bit better in some cases around oil and gas CapEx. And now the intent to spend, I think, it has to do more with uncertainty around the macro environment, whether that is interest rates or anything else. And if you look at the results that our customers are in hat, that our customers in heritage has been taken have posted the oil and gas companies, chemical companies, you can understand why perhaps there was a slowdown in spending in the quarter in order to support better results in light of lower revenue, lower profitability, driven by lower oil prices and margins in refining and the challenges around chemicals. So the question then is, okay, is it a temporary slowdown in spending? Does it go into Q4 or the remainder of the year? We don't know that. What we're working on and doing is now very rigorously engaged with our customers to make sure that if our champion or sponsor says, yes, we're going to do a deal that when he goes up to the CFO and CEO for approval that it is approved, because we saw some of that in the Q3 quarter. A strong willingness to do business by our champions and sponsors with approvals and then some deals that got rejected at the CFO, CEO level to the surprise of everyone, including our champions and sponsors. So I think this is a different dynamic. I think budgets are in there, frankly oil prices at $80, $90 or $70 are equally healthy, but the results reported by our customers for the March quarter certainly lead me to think as well that what we saw was just a premeditated pullback on spending. I mean, first of all, Rob, I already conducted a couple of reviews, one of the with the regional sales leaders and area and group leaders right after the quarter ended and then one a couple of weeks ago with the first line leaders for sales. And part of my objective was also to understand what are the challenges and opportunities that they see. We've come up with a very specific set of opportunities that we've put actions around them. Of course, first and foremost, when you have a lot of new sales people in the organization, it starts with their affinity for what customers are telling them, their ability to read the signals that customers are giving them or not, including their own body language when they're meeting with them. So we're certainly deploying a lot of our more experienced people on the deal that we believe we need to close in Q4, because one, it will help them accelerate their understanding of learning, but also it will give us greater assurance of what's coming back as a deal that have the opportunity to close Israel. Look, this isn't something that I think it's the regular process of sales people when they join a company and are learning. But we also have a lot of experienced people in the company that have been here selling for 15, 20, 25 years. So we're taking a much more rigorous approach around partnering and reviewing of the deals. We're also then looking at accelerating the onboarding, making sure that all the training that needs to happen, happens as quickly as possible and more specifically this quarter before we go into the new fiscal year and our new and our sales kickoff meeting in mid July for fiscal 2025. We don't want to wait until the sales kickoff meeting to bring to closure all the onboarding that has to happen, including what are our crown jewels when we're negotiating deals, including what are those terms and conditions in our agreements that are most important to us. Again, to maintain the high quality of business that we generate that supports the profitability that we drive in order to avoid the elongation of negotiations and then many other activities. I think the action plan is very clear. I think also there's some alignment that needs to happen when you have new people that are still learning their way around the organization. So we're also working to facilitate some of that. But I think, look, we've been onboarding people here for the last 12 months, 12, 18 months. The European DGM team was put in place pretty much in the middle of last year. There's newer people that got on boarded in Q1, Q2 and even some in Q3. So we're just working to make sure that we get everyone on the same page, going forward. But I'm optimistic. This is what we're supposed to do and we'll get it done. I mean, Rob, I think we've always emphasized that one of the challenges that we have with our fiscal year is that it starts on July 1st in the middle of fiscal budget for our customers. And then come January 1st, it's a new fiscal year for our customers, while we're still in the middle of our fiscal year, we normally just finished the second quarter. I think we saw good activity in Q1 and Q2. We always said that our fiscal year was going to be back end loaded, meaning to the second half of the year. And then we come into the new calendar year, new fiscal year for our customers, our Q3 quarter and customers deploy new budgets, but also their intent to spend or not clearly wasn't targeted at the March quarter. This is why I want to be very clear that we need to differentiate between budgets and spending. So I think what's happening here is we always said this was going to be back end loaded. We came into Q3 with great expectations, a great pipeline, a great visibility into deals. I said as much in the early February earnings call, and we got caught by surprise by the spending decisions of our customers. This is a challenge that we have with how our fiscal year lays out. In some case, some years, it's been positive, some years it's been neutral and other years it's been a surprise and I think that's what happened this time around the latter. Yes. Well, let me look. First of all, the incredible feedback from customers about the conference. The value proposition, our strategy, the opportunity that they see and the challenges that they have and how AspenTech is incredibly well lined up across all of that. So, it was really a moment of a high and that was great to see. Look, we also had great customer meetings around just new relationships, developed extending existing relationships and also specific deals. If you look at what happened, we had close to 1,200, 1,300 customers, our DGM plenary, which happened on Monday, was a standing room only plenary. We had seats for 550 people. We believe we got in there about 650. Part of that was due to customers from other industries interested on the DGM solutions to understand their applicability into their industries, whether it's refining, chemicals, mining. It was a sight to see to have that standing room on the plenary. We got great feedback from customers in DGM about the opportunity to take some of our artificial intelligence capabilities, our optimization capabilities, our control capabilities from our Heritage AspenTech Industries, refining chemicals into our utility solutions to enhance the value creation for them and resiliency of the grid. If you look at also the sessions that we had, one of the main points of feedback that we received is that some of our customers were frustrated, because there were so many sessions that they wanted to attend that were happening at the same time. So they were asking us to see find a way to extend the conference next time, so that they can attend more sessions. And this just speaks to the wealth of technology that now exists inside AspenTech that are so relevant to the challenges and opportunities that these customers are facing. So look, I said it in my plenary presentation, I've never been as excited about the future of this company as I am today. I came out of the conference even more convinced about that feeling and statement. And I think we have to work our way through this moment that we encounter in Q3. We have to certainly finish up some of the transformation initiatives that we're working on. And now that we have in place a sales team, because we now have it in place, We're only expanding sales in DGM to move into Asia and the Middle East. We're going to focus on solidifying the execution of the sales team, making sure that it's performing at the excellent level that we have traditionally performed in AspenTech, and I can only see positive going forward. But certainly, this has been a more challenging year than I expected than we expected in the company. But I just see these as a bump on the road and absolutely doesn't change our future trajectory whatsoever. Well, I mean, look, certainly, and we said it in the prepared remarks, I think one of the big opportunities that will now and we're already working on and we'll continue to work on here is efficiencies and productivity. When you have three companies coming together and really three and a small one in nation, there will always be opportunities to drive efficiencies as you simplify it, as you streamline the organization. So we're very much focused on that and including onetime expenses sort of non-compensation expenses, because as always, if you want to be a best-in-class profitability company, you have to do more with less and as a culture that we're building here and as part of the focus on efficiencies that we're driving and we'll continue to drive. From a productivity standpoint, it's always been my north star. You get to that profitability level is that really doing more with less on headcount and driving to maximum productivity. It's a multiyear journey, because you cannot just, it's not a binary 0 to 1. As you drive improvements and exercise your muscles, you get feeder and feeder. So this is why I said it was a multiyear journey to the productivity that we want to get to, but as you drive that productivity, you can grow and spending less, which then starts expanding profitability and free cash flow going forward. I know one of the things that we are giving credit for was in the early phases of my tenure in AspenTech when we maintained flat expenses for 4 years in this company and we drove incredible increases in profitability. And I believe that's possible. So I hear as well in the new aspect. So we're going to be focusing on all that much more rigorously. And in the meantime, we'll build our, we'll optimize our sales muscle and I'm sure we'll find ourselves in the right place here pretty soon. No, great point. No, look, our attrition is in line with what we guided for the year, about 5 points of attrition. Of course, we've had this large deal that we renewed in Q2, it's now in Q3 that produced a big bump of attrition. Excluding that deal, our attrition is in line because we've now closed that deal, so that was a net neutral deal, if you will. But no, attrition is fine and we believe we have very good side into that attrition in Q4 as well. Look, it's an interesting dynamic, because while a lot of engineering business got pushed out of the quarter, our E&C customers are expanding spending with AspenTech. We signed a number of transactions in the quarter, especially one of our largest E&Cs, where they expanded their spend with AspenTech by an incremental percentage, which is a sizable number in the context of their deal of the spend they already have with AspenTech. We're seeing these the same behavior across more and more E&Cs. So I don't think it's a CapEx related issue, because CapEx is a long term investment by these customers. I think this is a temporary pullback on OpEx spending that impacts on short-term deals in engineering and MSC and APM. The dynamic that we saw in APM is very typical of the dynamic that we saw during the pandemic in that pullback on OpEx, maintenance being a very discretionary area of spending. And even if you have deals that have already been signed, if they come up for renewal, we've also seen those customers give up on those on those agreements in order to save that spend. So overall, it's a combination of behavior that support the macro, the positive flashing green indicators that we have, but also what was clearly a pullback on spending in the quarter. Well, I mean, we're a typical software company in that regard in that most of our business closes in the last month, okay. And you can ask any software company and they'll probably give you numbers somewhere around 50%, 75% of the business closing in the last month of the quarter. That's just how sales cycles work. And now I'll say, and this is just a commentary, we've already closed good business in the April month, a lot of it tied to the Q4, to the Q2 to Q3 deals that we were pursuing. But there's also some business in Q3 that has moved into Q1. But what I'll also say is that, hardly ever those deals disappear from our pipeline, like a customer didn't want to do business and the deal falls off of the pipeline. It gets pushed out into the future and most of the business that pushed out of Q3 is in Q4 or some of it in Q1. Yes, yes. Look, Mark, the fact is that our APM business, especially our Mtell product, is a great product. I think Mtell has been given 5 or 6 awards as best technology or AI, IoT, whatever since the very beginning. I mean in almost every region of the world, Mtell has gotten a best technology award by hydrocarbon processing, by conferences. Frankly, it's a little bit incredible, the recognition that our products receive. So okay, a lot has happened with Mtell and APM. What we're clearly seeing is that the value proposition for Mtell is incredibly clear, quantifiable and material to, in some customer segments. To the extent that we see very little attrition in those customer segments. So these customers buy the technology deployed and expanded. So we have we have some customers already with the technology across 20, 25 sites generating incredible value. And I'm not going to mention what customer segments because I'm sure the competition is probably listening. But at the same time, we have some customer segments where customers love the technology. They buy, they implement it and for whatever reason, a year or 2 later, either their teams move on, get promoted, leave the company, and the value hasn't really been proven and quantified, and therefore, there isn't a commitment to sustaining the use of the technology. That is what generates attrition. So the product and Mtell and APM, they've never stop generating growth. The fact is that every quarter, there's an important amount of gross growth, new growth that gets generated that is negated then by some attrition. So in this review that we've done, and it's part of the outcome of the reviews that I've been involved in is clearly that if we sharpen our focus with Mtell and APM, we can go into some customer segments where we will be very successful with the product, where we will see very little attrition, and therefore, the net growth will be more material and a contributor to our overall growth as a company. So that's what we're doing. For fiscal '25, we're going to sharpen our strategy, we're going to be very focused and we're going to pursue not business for the sake of business, but high-quality business that doesn't generate attrition later on. And we believe we have a number of customer segments. I can tell you, we believe we're becoming the leader with Mtell in some of those customer segments by far. And those customers that are already using it, they just love the technology. All right. Thank you, Josh, and thank you to everyone for joining the call today. We will be attending the Baird Technology Conference and the William Blair Growth Conference in the first week of June. So please reach out to our Investor Relations team for more information on this event. We look forward to catching up with many of you soon. So thank you, everyone, for joining and we will see you on the road. Thanks."

After the speaker\u2019s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Brian Denyeau from ICR. Please go ahead.\nBrian Denyeau: Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, ending December 31, 2023. With me on the call today are Antonio Pietri, AspenTech\u2019s President and CEO; and Chris Stagno, AspenTech\u2019s Interim CFO. Please note we have posted earnings presentation on our IR website, and we ask that investors refer to this presentation in conjunction with today\u2019s call. Starting on Slide 2, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may different materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that have caused these results to differ materially are set forth in today\u2019s press release and in our annual report on Form 10-K and other subsequent filings made with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this presentation, we present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measure is included in today\u2019s earnings press release and investor presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, Brian, and welcome to everyone joining us today. Let me start by reiterating that I\u2019ve never been as excited about the future of AspenTech as I am today. The AspenTech team has done an excellent job working through a dynamic macro environment to deliver solid results in the second quarter. With an expanded portfolio and team, we\u2019re uniquely positioned to capture and benefit from the numerous opportunities available in the energy transition from efficiencies and sustainability use cases. Now, starting on Slide 3 with our quarterly results. In Q2, we saw solid demand for our products and solutions. Annual contract value, or ACV, was $914 million, increasing 9.6% year-over-year, while free cash flow was $29 million. These results reflect the delay in renewing a large customer agreement that was scheduled to be renewed in Q2 and reduced ACV growth by approximately 0.6 points. We now expect to close this customer agreement in Q3 with a corresponding benefit to Q3 ACV growth. In addition to this, I would like to highlight four key takeaways regarding our Q2 results. First, our overall term software pipeline has continued to increase. We\u2019re seeing growth in the number and size of opportunities across our businesses, which is in line with our sales channel investments over the past several quarters and the contribution from the DGM and SSE suites resulting from the transformation of those two businesses. We will start converting more of this pipeline to sales in the second half of fiscal year 2024. Second, the macro environment and demand for our products and solutions has remained strong in most end markets, consistent with our commentary from the last couple of quarters. Third, we made significant advances in upgrading our product portfolio and advancing new sustainability-related use cases in Q2. With the successful launch of our V14 software update, we have introduced enhancements to our products that we believe will drive incremental growth in the second half of fiscal year 2024 and longer term. Fourth and final taking all these factors into consideration, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our ACV growth target of at least 11.5% for the full fiscal year. We recognize that we need to have two strong quarters of growth in the second half to achieve this target, and we continue to believe that we\u2019re in a good position to deliver on this outcome. Turning to Slide 4, I will now provide an update on our end markets and suites, starting with digital grid management, our utility solutions business. DGM has enjoyed an excellent first half of the year as it continues to benefit from the mission-critical nature of its products and solutions alongside a robust demand environment. Importantly, today\u2019s utilities are in the early stages of an unprecedented investment cycle to expand the electrical grid, introduce renewable energy, and enhance cybersecurity capabilities to meet the growth in electricity demand driven by the energy transition and the energy security requirements of countries around the world. Our transformation initiative to align the DGM business with the Heritage AspenTech model over the past 18 months are also producing their expected results. These initiatives have included launching and growing DGM\u2019s term software licensing model, expanding its sales channel and global footprint to capitalize on the growth opportunities we\u2019re seeing and ramping up its ISP network. For example, in Q2, we won several large term license deals, including one with a leading North American power utility where we displaced the competition as part of their holding company\u2019s vendor standardization program. Our energy management solutions proven track record of delivering value as well as our longstanding relationships with other utilities in this holding company\u2019s portfolio were key catalysts for us in this win. Both in the U.S. and internationally, DGM\u2019s product strength, hardware agnostic stance, and ability to form a strategic long-term partnership with customers, are driving growth. We expect to see continuous strength from this suite in the second half of fiscal 2024 and believe this will be a high growth business for AspenTech going forward. Now, turning to our Subsurface Science & Engineering suite, SSE performed to expectations in the first half of the fiscal year, benefiting from a strong CapEx spending environment and new use cases driven by sustainability, especially in carbon capture and sequestration. SSE has long been the upstream industry\u2019s most comprehensive offering and the AspenTech go-to-market model is serving as a catalyst to help fully unleash its potential. In Q2, for example, SSE gained further momentum as we closed a large deal with a national oil company in Asia. While many vendors competed for this opportunity, the strength of our subsurface formation evaluation and geological modeling capabilities combined with the strength of our relationships across organization allowed us to ultimately win this deal. We continue to work closely with this customer and see clear pathways to expand this strategic relationship at additional sites with more solutions. SSE is also benefiting from synergies with our engineering suite and the positive momentum from its tokenization rollout. As with our other suites, we continue to see that the combination of a term license model and tokenized suite is a true win-win situation, allowing our customers to benefit from our latest innovation and supporting faster product update. Overall, we expect CapEx budgets in calendar 2024 to remain consistent with last year\u2019s, supporting the demand for SSE products in the second half of fiscal 2024 in line with our expectations. Now moving to Slide 5, let\u2019s review our Heritage AspenTech business, starting with our engineering suite. Strong CapEx trends in traditional upstream markets and newer sustainability-related use cases are driving greater usage by EPCs and our owner operators. On the back of this favorable spending environment, our engineering suite\u2019s modeling, simulation, and analysis capabilities have remained in high demand, supporting the strongest growth this suite has seen in many years in the first half of fiscal 2024. In Q2, for example, we won a large-scale deal with a new EPC logo that is executing several projects for a large energy company in the Middle East. Prior to working with AspenTech, this customer was using a variety of tools from different vendors to manage its process engineering workflows. The customer was interested in standardizing their engineering software solutions toolset and conducted a competitive evaluation process, resulting in the selection of AspenTech due to the breadth of capabilities. By engaging with AspenTech, they are now able to leverage our full portfolio of innovation and product synergies to execute on their project backlog. Separately, our engineering suite has continued to see solid traction with the small-to-medium business segment of the market through our high-velocity sales organization. During the quarter, this business continues to win engineering deals with customers in non-traditional industries for AspenTech that are looking to decarbonize their operations or see a business opportunity in sustainability, including such areas as the aviation biofuels, hydrogen, ammonia, LNG, direct carbon capture, or DAC, and more. Now, turning to our manufacturing and supply chain suite, the MSC results in the first half of 2024 reflected the ongoing weakness in the chemicals market, as well as the delayed renewal that I referenced earlier. Nevertheless, even this business\u2019 typical seasonality, strong pipeline, and expected closing of the delayed renewal agreement, as well as the continuation of solid refining demand and our ongoing innovation efforts, we expect a stronger performance in the second half of this year. As part of our recent V14 software update, we have made substantial improvement to our new Aspen Unified platform environment for asset planning and scheduling in MSC. Specifically, we have introduced tighter and better model integration, improved data management capabilities, deeper AI capabilities and a more scalable architecture. This represents the most significant update to our Unified platform\u2019s planning and scheduling solutions in over a decade. While we are still in the early phase of this rollout, customers are already responding positively to this improvement. For example, in Q2, we received a green light from one of the world\u2019s largest integrated energy companies to implement our updated Aspen Unified planning and scheduling solution across their asset base. This customer highly values the strength of our latest innovations, and ultimately, our ability to support better operational decision-making across their global teams. We\u2019re excited to work with them on this project over the next several months and see additional opportunities to support their digitalization initiatives going forward. Finally, our asset performance management suite continues to gain industry recognition and grow its customer base. For example, in Q2, our APM team closed an exciting win with a large global pharmaceutical company to implement our Mtell product at one of its European manufacturing plants. This deal was supported by our commercial agreement with Emerson, who also has a strong relationship with the customer via their offerings, including the DeltaV control system. While this deal was for one initial site, the customer has shown strong interest in rolling out the solution across its entire manufacturing base to drive further operational and sustainability excellence. Turning to Slide 6. We will discuss our sustainability initiatives. As I highlighted previously, sustainability related topics contributed to accelerated engineering suite growth in Q2. We believe that the strong tailwind we\u2019re seeing in sustainability is being driven by the energy transition and the alignment of corporate strategies with government policy and funding. This was further validated to me at COP28, the United Nations Climate Change Conference. As part of this event, public and private organizations alike made pledges to reduce carbon emissions by increasing renewable energy production and usage and driving higher energy efficiency. To do this, companies must not only accelerate their digitalization journeys but also leverage the potential of new and existing asset optimization technologies. We remain focused on partnering and co-innovating with customers in these areas in Q2 to accelerate their use case development. For example, we advance our collaboration with a large global player in renewable wind energy that aims to also secure leadership in the production of green hydrogen and ammonia. While this customer currently leverages our modeling and DMC3 process capabilities to drive efficiency, we\u2019re now also partnering to improve their electrolyzer modeling capabilities. Additionally, we\u2019ve built on our existing relationship with a refining company in Europe to implement our emissions management solution for better CO2 tracking, reporting, and modeling. This customer already relies on our solutions to run its assets more efficiently and sustainably and is excited about the potential to leverage our emissions management solution to better manage its carbon footprint going forward. As an organization, we also recognize that the challenges presented by the prevailing energy megatrends are considerable and we remain committed to doing our part. To that end, I\u2019m proud to announce that we made a formal commitment last week to achieve net zero emissions as an organization by 2045. As part of this commitment, we will build a decarbonization plan over the next 12 months to 24 months to achieve net zero for Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and across Scope 1 to 3 by 2045 in line with the science-based targets initiative. Now, turning to Slide 7 for our innovation initiatives. In November, we successfully launched enhancements to our version 14 and a new version 14.2 aspenONE software. This update included enhanced industrial AI, further OT data integration, and additional sustainability capabilities with more than 140 sustainability models now available to customers. As mentioned previously, this latest rollout is garnering positive customer response and helping us to win additional business. We look forward to showcasing the full range of our innovations at our optimized 2024 conference in Houston this May. I would also like to take a moment to speak about how our latest V14 update incorporates artificial intelligence. While we have been using industrial AI in our products for years, this latest update leverages the technology in ways that are new, innovative, and represent exciting growth drivers for us. For example, with this latest release, we have integrated additional AI capabilities including neural networks into Aspen Unified and Aspen HYSYS Dynamics Hybrid Models. These AI enhancements extend and build upon our ability to employ non-linear hybrid modeling in both traditional and sustainability related use cases to improve modeling accuracy. We have also incorporated generative AI based assistance into our strategic planning capabilities for sustainability pathways. This innovation helps to solve the cold start problem for users by using their queries or prompts to automatically create a new superstructure workflow, saving them time and allowing them to focus on more creative and high value of tasks. These are just a few examples of the way AspenTech is leveraging AI across our portfolio today. As always, our ability to leverage these innovations alongside the industry expertise and first principles know-how remains a competitive differentiator for us and highly valued by our customers. In closing, on Slide 8, we remain confident in our ability to deliver ACP growth of at least 11.5% year-over-year in fiscal 2024. Our confidence in reaffirming this guidance is primarily based on the following factors. First is the strength of our pipeline resulting from a positive macro environment, resilient demand and sales channel expansion. Second, the adoption of the DGM suite term licensing model is accelerating in the market and contributing to increasing growth. Third, the SSE suite and its tokenization continues to gain momentum in the market. Fourth, is the continued demand strength for our engineering suite, driven by upstream and sustainability CapEx. And fifth and final, an expanded sales channel will have a greater impact on pipeline conversion in the second half of the fiscal year. Specifically, on Q3, we now expect sequential ACV growth in the mid to high 3% range. This accounts for the closing of the delayed renewal agreement mentioned earlier, as well as the factors just referenced in support of our fiscal year guidance. Stronger Q3 and Q4 quarters are in line with our historical cadence as AspenTech\u2019s result have traditionally been more weighted to the second half of our fiscal year. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Chris for a discussion of our Q2 financial results. Chris?\nChris Stagno: Thank you, Antonio, and hello, everyone. I\u2019m excited to be with you here today and to help lead AspenTech through this CFO transition process. Turning to our Q2 performance, I will start out by highlighting that our earnings presentation includes explanations regarding the impact of ASC Topic 606 on our financial results. We have also included definitions of Annual Contract Value or ACV, bookings and free cash flow among other metrics in our earnings presentation now available on our IR website. We ask that investors refer to these definitions together with today\u2019s call. Starting on Slide 9, annual contract value was $914 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, up 9.6% year-over-year and 1.8% quarter-over-quarter. As Antonio mentioned, we had one large renewal, approximately $5.4 million, or 0.6 points of growth that we expected to close in the second quarter but was delayed. We now expect to close this deal in Q3. Total bookings were $233.4 million in the second quarter, decreasing 3.9% year-over-year, consistent with our expectations. Total revenue was $257 million for the second quarter, up 5.9% on a year-over-year basis. Please note that revenue in our model is heavily impacted by contract renewal timing and variability under ASC Topic 606. This includes the impact of the larger deal that was pushed out of Q2. Now turning to profitability. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported operating income of $89 million in Q2, representing a 34% non-GAAP operating margin. This compares to Non-GAAP operating income of $87 million for a Non-GAAP operating margin of 36% a year ago. The year-over-year increase in expenses was driven by increased headcount and compensation costs consistent with our sales expansion efforts and other business initiatives. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period to period due to the timing of customer renewals and the resulting impact on license revenue recognition in a given quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $88 million in the quarter, or $1.37 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $23 million or $0.35 per share. Please note that the difference in non-GAAP net income between periods was mainly due to the change in computing our tax provision, which initially occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $131 million of cash and cash equivalents, reflecting the impact of share repurchases under a $300 million share repurchase authorization and $197 million available under our revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 375,000 shares for $72 million under our $300 million share repurchase authorization for fiscal year 2024. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 955,000 shares for $186 million under the same authorization. On cash flows, we generated $30 million of cash flow from operations and $29 million of free cash flow in Q2, compared to $50 million in cash flow from operations and $48 million in free cash flow a year ago, mainly due to higher cash tax and the variability of contract cycle renewals and billings between that. Turning to Slide 10, I would now like to close with guidance. For the full year of fiscal 2024, we are reiterating our outlook across all metrics. We continue to expect ACV growth of at least 11.5% in fiscal 2024. As Antonio mentioned, we are seeing pipeline strength, a healthy demand environment, several other notable tailwinds across our business that support our conviction as we move into the second half of our fiscal year. In addition, our non-GAAP EPS range has increased by $0.02 from our prior guide to reflect the impact of our share repurchase activity in the second quarter. There was no impact to GAAP EPS. Now turning to Slide 11 for linearity. As Antonio noted, we now expect to deliver sequential ACV growth in the mid to high 3% range in the third quarter. On free cash flow, we expect Q4 to come in slightly above Q3. On revenue, we continue to expect our fiscal 2024 revenue linearity to be similar to that of fiscal 2023. This includes expectations for bookings up for renewal of $580 million in fiscal 2024 with $173 million up for renewal in Q3 and $195 million up for renewal in Q4. For a complete overview of our fiscal year 2024 guidance and linearity commentary, please refer to our earnings presentation slides now available on our IR website. In closing, we delivered a solid Q2 performance to close out the first half of our fiscal 2024. With a strong foundation in place, we continue to make investments in those areas that can support growth, while also remaining disciplined in our execution to return to our historical profitability levels over time. Looking ahead, we are excited about the opportunities we are seeing across our end markets and confident in our ability to deliver on our fiscal 2024 financial targets. With that, I will turn it back over to Antonio for closing comments.\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks, Chris. As I mentioned earlier, we recognize that we need two strong quarters of growth in the second half to achieve our fiscal 2024 guidance targets. We believe that we\u2019re in a good position to deliver on this outcome. Our confidence is supported by the factors we laid out today. We\u2019re also excited by the growth potential of our innovation efforts. Across our portfolio, we continue to roll out new and enhanced capabilities to help our customers better meet their efficiency and sustainability objectives. As global leaders in industrial software, AspenTech has a long track record of partnering closely with customers to understand their needs, support their digitalization efforts, and drive positive business outcomes. We remain fully committed to this work going forward. With that, we will open it up for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rob Oliver from Baird. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Rob.\nRob Oliver: Great. Hi, Antonio. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two. My first one is, just I know you\u2019ve called out the sort of back-half-weighted nature of the ACV guide, and you provided some details around that. I think even with the deal that slipped, at least in our model, it shows up as something markedly more back-end loaded than historically you guys were. So just some of the things you mentioned pipeline, channel expansions, I guess, maybe if you could just home in on kind of one or two things that gives you the most comfort here as we look at that sort of big ramp you guys need in the second half. And then typically in the past you guys provided a range, and this year you guys said that that would be sort of the minimum, is that now the goal, in other words, the chance of kind of beating that number and that being the minimum kind of off the table now. And then I just had a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I mean, like, first of all, we remain to our guidance, which it\u2019s always been at least 11.5% and that is the goal. And time will tell what that means, but at least 11.5% over that number. Look, with regards to how weighted this year is to the second half, first of all, of course, that delayed renewal, which is about 0.6 points of growth, and unfortunately through complications and internal alignment and administrative issues with that customer, that deal didn\u2019t get renewed on time. This isn\u2019t the first time that something like this happens. This is certainly the largest deal that we\u2019ve had to experience that with. Normally, it\u2019s much smaller transactions, but it\u2019s not unusual, and this is the first time that we\u2019ll probably have to disclose something like this. With regards to our confidence on the second half, look, it starts with the volume of the pipeline. Our pipeline over the last 12 months, January to January, our total pipeline for the company has grown over 30% and this is certainly supported by the channel sales expansion, but also by the macro environment that we see, the demand from our customers, and certainly the market leadership position of our products. But more specifically, look, we\u2019re very excited about the fact that now after 18 months, some of the transformation initiatives that we started working at the beginning of fiscal 2023 are starting to bear fruit. The outcome for DGM on term software licensing in the first half of the year was a great outcome. The term software pipeline for DGM is expanding very rapidly. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s grown by almost 500% in the last 12 months, and the majority of our customers are now accepting term software. So we\u2019re very excited about that, and we have a positive outlook for the DGM suite for the full year. Equally, the transformation of the SSE suite into a token suite, they used to do term deals, mostly one-year deals, now it\u2019s tokens, and we\u2019re expanding the duration of those deals. It continues to gain momentum. This is gaining the attention of our customers, but look, I also believe it\u2019s catching the attention of our competition, because it is starting to eat into the market position of some of our competitors. So we\u2019re also very excited about SSE, and we also have a positive outlook for that suite for the full year. Look, equally, the growth that we\u2019re seeing on the engineering suite that started last year, last fiscal year, but has continued this year and we expect it to continue through the full fiscal year is very exciting. It\u2019s driven by both the cap expand, but also sustainability cap expand, and we expect that suite to perform very well for the full fiscal year and most likely above planned. And then, look, we now have an expanded sales team that\u2019s in place for the most part that is now familiar with our motion and cadences, and we expect them to be very, very engaged converting that pipeline here in Q3, Q4. But I also want to say the following, because in a way, with Heritage AspenTech, after 40 years of taking those products to market, we relied on volume to deliver our results in the past, and once in a while we had deals of significant size. What we are now seeing with DGM and SSE is that we have a larger number of more sizable deals in our pipeline that come through as a result of the spend that utilities have to put in place in order to upgrade their systems. These are very large systems that required a lot of software and technology. Therefore, the size of these deals is seven figures and sometimes deep in the seven figures. And with SSE, we\u2019re also seeing deals that are larger than historically had deal. So when we look at our pipeline, it\u2019s not only volume but also size, especially as we talk specifically Q3 and Q4. So there are many reasons for this. As I said, very excited about what I see going forward. And of course, we know that we need to hit on all cylinders to deliver Q3 and Q4 and my expectation is that we will.\nRob Oliver: I appreciate all the detail, Antonio. Thank you. Just quickly as a follow-up, if you could just comment because the question we\u2019ve been getting from investors is around your relationship with Aramco. And I know that you guys do have a co-innovation model with Aramco, and they\u2019re an important customer. Could you just comment on what the recent production cut from Aramco could mean in terms of their CapEx and if that might have any impact at all on Aspen? I know you do a lot with them. Thank you very much.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Aramco is one of my \u2013 our most important customers. We\u2019ve had \u2013 we\u2019ve been doing business with Aramco for probably 30 years. Certainly, with SSE relationship has expanded with Aramco. But look, it\u2019s a relationship that existed and spend that existed before they announced that we\u2019re going to expand their production from 12 million to 13 million barrels. And now that they\u2019ve announced that they\u2019re going to not do it and stay at 12 million barrels. I don\u2019t think it changes our outlook for Aramco. As a matter of fact, Aramco has been a heavy user of our engineering suite. And in my prepared remarks, I talked about the opportunities or advantages that our customers are seeing from leveraging the synergies around the engineering suite and the SSE suite. So we\u2019re engaged with Aramco. And furthermore, what I will say is that on a global basis, oil and gas companies have to replace 4 million to 5 million barrels of oil production every year because of depletion in their reservoirs. So there is a lot of CapEx that has to be put to work to just maintain production, let alone increase it. So we\u2019re still very optimistic about our outlook in the Middle East overall.\nRob Oliver: Great. Thanks again, Antonio. I appreciate it.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, Rob.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Matthew Pfau from William and Blair. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Matt.\nMatthew Pfau: Hi. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to first ask a follow-up in terms of the back half ramp for ACV. So if we exclude the deal, the renewal that got delayed, is the back half ramp still in line with your expectations from the previous quarter? Or did it get more back-end loaded absent that the impact of that renewal?\nAntonio Pietri: Just slightly \u2013 slightly higher in the second half. If you were to put that deal back into Q2, it\u2019s just a few percentage points higher at the second half, but nothing that material.\nMatthew Pfau: Okay, great. And then on DGM, good to hear the commentary on that pipeline being up 500% over the past 12 months for term deals. What about in terms of implementation capacity there? I know that building out the ecosystem has been a focus. Do you feel you have enough implementation capacity to implement those deals?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, I think this is something that we remain very focused on. This is the reason why we continue to progress building the implementation services partner network that \u2013 that we talked about already 12, 18 months ago. But also equally, part of that demand is new business that we\u2019re generating in other regions of the world and we\u2019re setting up teams in those regions as well, including developing these partnerships. So we\u2019re confident in our ability to meet the demand, working closely and collaborating with these customers as these agreements get signed and the implementation plans get defined.\nMatthew Pfau: Okay, great. Appreciate it guys.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Mark Schappel from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Mark.\nMark Schappel: Hi. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Antonio, I was wondering if you could just provide some additional details around that slipped [ph] renewal contract in terms of, say, industry or geography. And also, too, I mean, what\u2019s giving you confidence that that slipped renewal will close in Q3.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well \u2013 so Mark, just for reasons of confidentiality and considering that our friendly competitors may always be listening, we won\u2019t talk about the geography, what technologies or products this is about. As we said, it\u2019s about \u2013 it\u2019s a renewal that got delayed, it\u2019s about $5.4 million in value. We expect that it will close in Q3. We have a very detailed sequence of events, and we are about three quarters through the sequence of event already. So we expect that transaction to close in Q3.\nMark Schappel: Okay. That\u2019s fair. Thanks. And then regarding your joint commercial agreement with Emerson, is there an immediate or maybe a near-term industry focus around that agreement? So for example, you did a pulp and paper joint deal with them last quarter. It looks like a pharma \u2013 a nice pharma deal this quarter. It appears that the commercial agreement is focused more on process manufacturing industries outside of the core oil and gas business. So I was wondering if you could just comment on that.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, I think in the first 12 months of the commercial agreement, mostly fiscal 2023, as we learned about each other, it became clear that focus was going to be very important in succeeding initially in the partnership. So we have \u2013 we are targeting very specific areas of engagement, both areas like pharma, but also areas where Emerson has a lot of strength in their businesses, whether it\u2019s geographies, whether it\u2019s types of projects that they pursue and other areas where Emerson has a very strong presence and also non-traditional industries for AspenTech. We\u2019ve been very focused on that in this fiscal year. Our efforts are very targeted in that regard. And we believe that this is paying off and will pay off more handsomely in the future as we ramp up those go-to-market activities.\nMark Schappel: Great. Thank you. That\u2019s all for me.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Jason.\nJason Celino: Hi, thanks. Yes. Hi, Antonio. Now that we\u2019ve \u2013 well, not we\u2019ve, but now that most of your customers have kind of set their budgets for the year. How are global CapEx rates looking for this year? And maybe how does that maybe compare to last year?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. No. Look, actually, we\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019re hearing and seeing. Oil and gas CapEx are more or less in line to last year or up depending on the customer segment or geography. And by that, I mean, probably 5% to 10%, but mostly in line with last year, which was healthy and good for our business. Refining customers equally, CapEx spending in line with what they\u2019ve traditionally done and what they did last year. Chemicals is more of the same. So we don\u2019t expect a recovery in the spend \u2013 OpEx spend by chemical customers. In calendar 2024 the fact is that the sort of soft patch that they are going through will probably extend through the full calendar year. And then utilities, look, utilities more and more CapEx is being targeted at global electrification and in that utilities. But part of that CapEx in global electrification is going into renewables, whether it\u2019s solar and wind. But that renewable \u2013 that electricity produced from renewables has to be put into or connected into the grid. And therefore, utilities then have to spend to upgrade their systems, deal with the complexity of more and more renewable energy electricity into their networks. And this is one of the main drivers for them to have to spend to upgrade their systems. We\u2019re very excited about what we were hearing from utilities. And look, it used to be a very sort of a steady-state industry 30, 40 years ago. Today it is an incredibly exciting industry. It\u2019s an industry that absolutely will have to rely on technology to deal with the complexity of the grid to maintain the grid imbalance and in operation but also to cybersecurity. And our conversations not only about delivering our software to these customers, but also co-innovating and accelerating co-innovation because part of \u2013 one of the challenges that if you talk to utilities customers is they feel that there needs to be an acceleration of innovation for them to keep up with the complexity that they\u2019re having to manage. So we\u2019re very excited about this over the last 12, 18 months and especially the last six months of last calendar year, I traveled to main utility customers around the world. Not only am I excited about what I just mentioned, but also about the role that now new AspenTech with the DGM suite plays around global electrification and global infrastructure. AspenTech and the Monarch SCADA system in the DGM suite is responsible not only for managing, but keeping the electrical grid in balance for the entire country of India, for example, but also the entire country of Vietnam, but also for Southern California, the lights in Southern California are kept on through the use of our outsource technology and systems. 40% of utilities in the United States are using now the DGM products and solutions that AspenTech is key to them. But also we\u2019ve made great progress moving into Europe. And now we\u2019re going to be basically the foundation technology for multiple countries in Europe and certainly in the Netherlands, TenneT is a well-known installation that\u2019s been going on for two, three years now. But we\u2019ve also won business in two or three other countries where our technology is going to be the base technology to run the grid in those countries. And I won\u2019t mention them because just recently signed agreements but equally, our expansion into Latin America, we run the largest transmission network in Latin America using our technology, the entire gas distribution network in Spain is run using the Monarch SCADA system in the DGM suite. And look, every time we win a deal we\u2019re displacing the competition. we\u2019re displacing industrial that have been in the market for many years, but now their solutions having kept up with the needs of the industry. And this is then where OSI and now AspenTech are stepping into the bridge and being very successful. So we\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019re seeing with DGM. I think this is a game-changing suite for us. And as I said, it\u2019s not only the volume but also the size of deals. And I think that\u2019s part of what gives us confidence about the success we\u2019re going to have in Q3 and Q4.\nJason Celino: Okay, awesome. Good stuff on DGM. Maybe to follow-up on Matt\u2019s earlier question, so apologies, but if we strip out that chemicals deal slipping and you think about the pipeline moving a little bit more back half weighted what area moved back if it was a specific vertical, or was it chemicals? Curious on how you would kind of characterize it.\nAntonio Pietri: Well, look, I don\u2019t want to confirm or deny that deal that slipped, is a chemical deal. We haven\u2019t said anything about what vertical it is in. But putting that aside, look, as we said, certainly, the MSC suite, what we\u2019ll say is that deal certainly is a transaction that is all MSC software. So, that impacted the performance of the MSC suite in the first half of the year. Chemicals was a little flat. So, we do expect a stronger performance for MSC in the second half of the year. APM has continued to behave in the same manner that it has now for a couple of years. But we\u2019re also excited about our performance in engineering because we do think that we\u2019ll be able to make up if necessary, for any shortfall that we may see around MSC or APM. But our goal is to get certainly the MSC suite to plan and, if possible, also APM. And look, what we\u2019re seeing with DGM and SSE is also exciting. So overall, we were confident there\u2019s work to do here. We\u2019re going to execute and we have two quarters to do at least 11.5%.\nJason Celino: Okay, great. Thank you, will get back in queue.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Nay Soe Naing from Berenberg. Your line is now open.\nNay Soe Naing: Hi, everyone, thanks for taking my question. I actually have a few [indiscernible] if I may. Just on these developments\u2026\nAntonio Pietri: Nay Soe, you are breaking up. You are not coming through. Operator, I think we lost Nay Soe.\nOperator: One moment please. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Arsenije Matovic from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Arsenije.\nArsenije Matovic: Hi, this is Arsenije \u2013 hi Antonio how are you? This is Arsenije on for Josh. Thanks for taking my question. So seeing that this delayed renewal impacted about $5.4 million of ACV in the quarter, what gives you more confidence in the visibility to ramp in the second half? Was this idiosyncratic to the company up for renewal? Or could this maybe show more weakness in their respective end market then was initially expected for the second half of 2024. And then I have a brief follow-up on DGM. Thanks.\nAntonio Pietri: No, look Arsenije, the specifics around these deals that didn\u2019t renew have nothing to do with the macro environment or demand. It\u2019s just some internal issues and administrative issues with this customer. We thought the deal was going to get renewed and it didn\u2019t. So it will happen now in Q3. So nothing to do with demand at all. Look, what gives us confidence, we\u2019ve said it. A pipeline, the strength that we\u2019re seeing in DGM, SSE Engineering, a bigger sales organization that is now in place to convert that pipeline. So overall, those are the factors that we think will get us there.\nArsenije Matovic: Got it. Thanks for that. And then given the traction you\u2019re seeing in DGM, is the 2.5 percentage point starting point for the contribution to ACV that you expected for growth conservative? Can that be a stronger contribution to growth? And then just very briefly on the renewal impact, what was the specific impact to free cash flow in the quarter from the renewal? Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Let me first address the question on DGM, and then I\u2019ll have Chris talk about that impact, but if any. Look, 2.5 points is the goal. 2.5 points of growth contribution is the goal for DGM. Hopefully, we\u2019ll exceed it, but we\u2019ll keep that as the goal for the moment. The pipeline looks solid, but let\u2019s see what we get to at the end of Q4.\nChris Stagno: Yes. And then as it relates to free cash flow, there was an impact as it related to that renewal being pushed out. It was the ACV amount that we quoted of about $5.4 million. We do expect that, like Antonio said, the deal will close in the third quarter, and then we\u2019d collect that in the second half of the year.\nArsenije Matovic: Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Clarke.\nClarke Jeffries: Hello, thank you for taking the question. Antonio, it sounds like the growth in the pipeline is broad-based, but I wanted to specifically ask around the sales capacity expansion and the sales capacity that seems to be coming online in the second half. Can you remind us, is that broad-based across the business? Is that weighted to DGM? Is that really the primary driver, even in first half, in terms of the pipeline growth? And any assumptions around close rates based off of that expansion of capacity coming on in the second half? Trying to understand if this is a particular product category or all rounds of business getting a capacity increase. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, as you would expect, certainly a significant portion of the sales investment went into DGM, the expansion of the sales organization in DGM into other regions, but also in North America. Expansion of the high velocity sales organization are small to medium sales team because we\u2019re seeing accelerated growth in that team, so that team also benefited from an important expansion in the headcount. That team is pursuing mostly engineering business that comes through consulting, engineering consulting companies or companies that are first customers of AspenTech \u2013 first-time customers of AspenTech. This is a team that has obtained companies like Tesla, Meta, Google to be customers of AspenTech. So there\u2019s a very active team and a team that has grown materially for us over the last two, three years. But also we added especially solution consultants in our Heritage AspenTech team as we focus also on driving more enterprise-type deals with our customers in that area, considering the critical mass of business that we already have with some of these customers, we believe there\u2019s an opportunity there for us to do more with those customers. And a little bit of as we reorganize SSE into our head sales organization, we\u2019ve also made a little bit of investments to the SSE team as well.\nClarke Jeffries: Perfect. And just one follow-up on that. At this point, I mean, imagine there\u2019s a lag between the hiring and the actual capacity, the reps being ready. But are you at the point where you\u2019re still on the upswing in terms of hiring ambitions or growing headcount? Or is this all about maturity of kind of previously hired individuals trying to understand if there\u2019s further ramps coming even beyond fiscal 2024?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, I mean, look at the \u2013 we\u2019re pretty much done with expansion in fiscal 2024, that, that this investment cycle started in Q4 of fiscal 2023, so last April, nine months ago, we\u2019re done. Most of the sales headcount is in place. It\u2019s been in place for a number of months. So this is why we expect to see \u2013 we\u2019re seeing the benefit on the pipeline and we expect to see the benefit on the conversion. Now, having said that, now for fiscal 2025 coming up, we\u2019ll look at what investments we need to make around expanding the DGM sales organization into other parts of the world and what other sort of tweak investments we have to make in other parts of the sales organization. But this was an important ramp up in headcount, and now we also want to see that additional headcount increase in productivity. So good investment, a little bit more investment in fiscal 2025 around DGM and a few other areas. And look, now that I talked about pipeline and conversion, there was a question just before about the conversion rate for our pipeline. Look, the \u2013 we tracked certainly the conversion rate for our pipeline quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, and we expect that the historical range of conversion that we\u2019ve seen in order to deliver our goals is what we need to have in Q3, Q4 to achieve at least 11.5%. So we do \u2013 the team does a good job of tracking the performance against historical and as a forebearer of what\u2019s going to come.\nClarke Jeffries: Really appreciate the color. Thank you very much.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. And I\u2019m showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Antonio Pietri.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. Over the coming months, we will attend two investor conferences. In February, we\u2019re going to attend the Wolfe Investor Conference, and in March, we will attend the KeyBanc Emerging Technology Summit. So please reach out to our Investor Relations team for more information on these two events, and we look forward to catching up with many of you soon. Thank you, everyone, for joining, and we will see you on the road. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Chris Stagno",
            "content": "Thank you, Antonio, and hello, everyone. I'm excited to be with you here today and to help lead AspenTech through this CFO transition process. Turning to our Q2 performance, I will start out by highlighting that our earnings presentation includes explanations regarding the impact of ASC Topic 606 on our financial results. We have also included definitions of Annual Contract Value or ACV, bookings and free cash flow among other metrics in our earnings presentation now available on our IR website. We ask that investors refer to these definitions together with today's call. Starting on Slide 9, annual contract value was $914 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, up 9.6% year-over-year and 1.8% quarter-over-quarter. As Antonio mentioned, we had one large renewal, approximately $5.4 million, or 0.6 points of growth that we expected to close in the second quarter but was delayed. We now expect to close this deal in Q3. Total bookings were $233.4 million in the second quarter, decreasing 3.9% year-over-year, consistent with our expectations. Total revenue was $257 million for the second quarter, up 5.9% on a year-over-year basis. Please note that revenue in our model is heavily impacted by contract renewal timing and variability under ASC Topic 606. This includes the impact of the larger deal that was pushed out of Q2. Now turning to profitability. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported operating income of $89 million in Q2, representing a 34% non-GAAP operating margin. This compares to Non-GAAP operating income of $87 million for a Non-GAAP operating margin of 36% a year ago. The year-over-year increase in expenses was driven by increased headcount and compensation costs consistent with our sales expansion efforts and other business initiatives. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period to period due to the timing of customer renewals and the resulting impact on license revenue recognition in a given quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $88 million in the quarter, or $1.37 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $23 million or $0.35 per share. Please note that the difference in non-GAAP net income between periods was mainly due to the change in computing our tax provision, which initially occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $131 million of cash and cash equivalents, reflecting the impact of share repurchases under a $300 million share repurchase authorization and $197 million available under our revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 375,000 shares for $72 million under our $300 million share repurchase authorization for fiscal year 2024. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 955,000 shares for $186 million under the same authorization. On cash flows, we generated $30 million of cash flow from operations and $29 million of free cash flow in Q2, compared to $50 million in cash flow from operations and $48 million in free cash flow a year ago, mainly due to higher cash tax and the variability of contract cycle renewals and billings between that. Turning to Slide 10, I would now like to close with guidance. For the full year of fiscal 2024, we are reiterating our outlook across all metrics. We continue to expect ACV growth of at least 11.5% in fiscal 2024. As Antonio mentioned, we are seeing pipeline strength, a healthy demand environment, several other notable tailwinds across our business that support our conviction as we move into the second half of our fiscal year. In addition, our non-GAAP EPS range has increased by $0.02 from our prior guide to reflect the impact of our share repurchase activity in the second quarter. There was no impact to GAAP EPS. Now turning to Slide 11 for linearity. As Antonio noted, we now expect to deliver sequential ACV growth in the mid to high 3% range in the third quarter. On free cash flow, we expect Q4 to come in slightly above Q3. On revenue, we continue to expect our fiscal 2024 revenue linearity to be similar to that of fiscal 2023. This includes expectations for bookings up for renewal of $580 million in fiscal 2024 with $173 million up for renewal in Q3 and $195 million up for renewal in Q4. For a complete overview of our fiscal year 2024 guidance and linearity commentary, please refer to our earnings presentation slides now available on our IR website. In closing, we delivered a solid Q2 performance to close out the first half of our fiscal 2024. With a strong foundation in place, we continue to make investments in those areas that can support growth, while also remaining disciplined in our execution to return to our historical profitability levels over time. Looking ahead, we are excited about the opportunities we are seeing across our end markets and confident in our ability to deliver on our fiscal 2024 financial targets. With that, I will turn it back over to Antonio for closing comments. Yes. And then as it relates to free cash flow, there was an impact as it related to that renewal being pushed out. It was the ACV amount that we quoted of about $5.4 million. We do expect that, like Antonio said, the deal will close in the third quarter, and then we'd collect that in the second half of the year."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Antonio Pietri",
            "content": "Thank you, Brian, and welcome to everyone joining us today. Let me start by reiterating that I've never been as excited about the future of AspenTech as I am today. The AspenTech team has done an excellent job working through a dynamic macro environment to deliver solid results in the second quarter. With an expanded portfolio and team, we're uniquely positioned to capture and benefit from the numerous opportunities available in the energy transition from efficiencies and sustainability use cases. Now, starting on Slide 3 with our quarterly results. In Q2, we saw solid demand for our products and solutions. Annual contract value, or ACV, was $914 million, increasing 9.6% year-over-year, while free cash flow was $29 million. These results reflect the delay in renewing a large customer agreement that was scheduled to be renewed in Q2 and reduced ACV growth by approximately 0.6 points. We now expect to close this customer agreement in Q3 with a corresponding benefit to Q3 ACV growth. In addition to this, I would like to highlight four key takeaways regarding our Q2 results. First, our overall term software pipeline has continued to increase. We're seeing growth in the number and size of opportunities across our businesses, which is in line with our sales channel investments over the past several quarters and the contribution from the DGM and SSE suites resulting from the transformation of those two businesses. We will start converting more of this pipeline to sales in the second half of fiscal year 2024. Second, the macro environment and demand for our products and solutions has remained strong in most end markets, consistent with our commentary from the last couple of quarters. Third, we made significant advances in upgrading our product portfolio and advancing new sustainability-related use cases in Q2. With the successful launch of our V14 software update, we have introduced enhancements to our products that we believe will drive incremental growth in the second half of fiscal year 2024 and longer term. Fourth and final taking all these factors into consideration, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our ACV growth target of at least 11.5% for the full fiscal year. We recognize that we need to have two strong quarters of growth in the second half to achieve this target, and we continue to believe that we're in a good position to deliver on this outcome. Turning to Slide 4, I will now provide an update on our end markets and suites, starting with digital grid management, our utility solutions business. DGM has enjoyed an excellent first half of the year as it continues to benefit from the mission-critical nature of its products and solutions alongside a robust demand environment. Importantly, today's utilities are in the early stages of an unprecedented investment cycle to expand the electrical grid, introduce renewable energy, and enhance cybersecurity capabilities to meet the growth in electricity demand driven by the energy transition and the energy security requirements of countries around the world. Our transformation initiative to align the DGM business with the Heritage AspenTech model over the past 18 months are also producing their expected results. These initiatives have included launching and growing DGM's term software licensing model, expanding its sales channel and global footprint to capitalize on the growth opportunities we're seeing and ramping up its ISP network. For example, in Q2, we won several large term license deals, including one with a leading North American power utility where we displaced the competition as part of their holding company's vendor standardization program. Our energy management solutions proven track record of delivering value as well as our longstanding relationships with other utilities in this holding company's portfolio were key catalysts for us in this win. Both in the U.S. and internationally, DGM's product strength, hardware agnostic stance, and ability to form a strategic long-term partnership with customers, are driving growth. We expect to see continuous strength from this suite in the second half of fiscal 2024 and believe this will be a high growth business for AspenTech going forward. Now, turning to our Subsurface Science & Engineering suite, SSE performed to expectations in the first half of the fiscal year, benefiting from a strong CapEx spending environment and new use cases driven by sustainability, especially in carbon capture and sequestration. SSE has long been the upstream industry's most comprehensive offering and the AspenTech go-to-market model is serving as a catalyst to help fully unleash its potential. In Q2, for example, SSE gained further momentum as we closed a large deal with a national oil company in Asia. While many vendors competed for this opportunity, the strength of our subsurface formation evaluation and geological modeling capabilities combined with the strength of our relationships across organization allowed us to ultimately win this deal. We continue to work closely with this customer and see clear pathways to expand this strategic relationship at additional sites with more solutions. SSE is also benefiting from synergies with our engineering suite and the positive momentum from its tokenization rollout. As with our other suites, we continue to see that the combination of a term license model and tokenized suite is a true win-win situation, allowing our customers to benefit from our latest innovation and supporting faster product update. Overall, we expect CapEx budgets in calendar 2024 to remain consistent with last year's, supporting the demand for SSE products in the second half of fiscal 2024 in line with our expectations. Now moving to Slide 5, let's review our Heritage AspenTech business, starting with our engineering suite. Strong CapEx trends in traditional upstream markets and newer sustainability-related use cases are driving greater usage by EPCs and our owner operators. On the back of this favorable spending environment, our engineering suite's modeling, simulation, and analysis capabilities have remained in high demand, supporting the strongest growth this suite has seen in many years in the first half of fiscal 2024. In Q2, for example, we won a large-scale deal with a new EPC logo that is executing several projects for a large energy company in the Middle East. Prior to working with AspenTech, this customer was using a variety of tools from different vendors to manage its process engineering workflows. The customer was interested in standardizing their engineering software solutions toolset and conducted a competitive evaluation process, resulting in the selection of AspenTech due to the breadth of capabilities. By engaging with AspenTech, they are now able to leverage our full portfolio of innovation and product synergies to execute on their project backlog. Separately, our engineering suite has continued to see solid traction with the small-to-medium business segment of the market through our high-velocity sales organization. During the quarter, this business continues to win engineering deals with customers in non-traditional industries for AspenTech that are looking to decarbonize their operations or see a business opportunity in sustainability, including such areas as the aviation biofuels, hydrogen, ammonia, LNG, direct carbon capture, or DAC, and more. Now, turning to our manufacturing and supply chain suite, the MSC results in the first half of 2024 reflected the ongoing weakness in the chemicals market, as well as the delayed renewal that I referenced earlier. Nevertheless, even this business' typical seasonality, strong pipeline, and expected closing of the delayed renewal agreement, as well as the continuation of solid refining demand and our ongoing innovation efforts, we expect a stronger performance in the second half of this year. As part of our recent V14 software update, we have made substantial improvement to our new Aspen Unified platform environment for asset planning and scheduling in MSC. Specifically, we have introduced tighter and better model integration, improved data management capabilities, deeper AI capabilities and a more scalable architecture. This represents the most significant update to our Unified platform's planning and scheduling solutions in over a decade. While we are still in the early phase of this rollout, customers are already responding positively to this improvement. For example, in Q2, we received a green light from one of the world's largest integrated energy companies to implement our updated Aspen Unified planning and scheduling solution across their asset base. This customer highly values the strength of our latest innovations, and ultimately, our ability to support better operational decision-making across their global teams. We're excited to work with them on this project over the next several months and see additional opportunities to support their digitalization initiatives going forward. Finally, our asset performance management suite continues to gain industry recognition and grow its customer base. For example, in Q2, our APM team closed an exciting win with a large global pharmaceutical company to implement our Mtell product at one of its European manufacturing plants. This deal was supported by our commercial agreement with Emerson, who also has a strong relationship with the customer via their offerings, including the DeltaV control system. While this deal was for one initial site, the customer has shown strong interest in rolling out the solution across its entire manufacturing base to drive further operational and sustainability excellence. Turning to Slide 6. We will discuss our sustainability initiatives. As I highlighted previously, sustainability related topics contributed to accelerated engineering suite growth in Q2. We believe that the strong tailwind we're seeing in sustainability is being driven by the energy transition and the alignment of corporate strategies with government policy and funding. This was further validated to me at COP28, the United Nations Climate Change Conference. As part of this event, public and private organizations alike made pledges to reduce carbon emissions by increasing renewable energy production and usage and driving higher energy efficiency. To do this, companies must not only accelerate their digitalization journeys but also leverage the potential of new and existing asset optimization technologies. We remain focused on partnering and co-innovating with customers in these areas in Q2 to accelerate their use case development. For example, we advance our collaboration with a large global player in renewable wind energy that aims to also secure leadership in the production of green hydrogen and ammonia. While this customer currently leverages our modeling and DMC3 process capabilities to drive efficiency, we're now also partnering to improve their electrolyzer modeling capabilities. Additionally, we've built on our existing relationship with a refining company in Europe to implement our emissions management solution for better CO2 tracking, reporting, and modeling. This customer already relies on our solutions to run its assets more efficiently and sustainably and is excited about the potential to leverage our emissions management solution to better manage its carbon footprint going forward. As an organization, we also recognize that the challenges presented by the prevailing energy megatrends are considerable and we remain committed to doing our part. To that end, I'm proud to announce that we made a formal commitment last week to achieve net zero emissions as an organization by 2045. As part of this commitment, we will build a decarbonization plan over the next 12 months to 24 months to achieve net zero for Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and across Scope 1 to 3 by 2045 in line with the science-based targets initiative. Now, turning to Slide 7 for our innovation initiatives. In November, we successfully launched enhancements to our version 14 and a new version 14.2 aspenONE software. This update included enhanced industrial AI, further OT data integration, and additional sustainability capabilities with more than 140 sustainability models now available to customers. As mentioned previously, this latest rollout is garnering positive customer response and helping us to win additional business. We look forward to showcasing the full range of our innovations at our optimized 2024 conference in Houston this May. I would also like to take a moment to speak about how our latest V14 update incorporates artificial intelligence. While we have been using industrial AI in our products for years, this latest update leverages the technology in ways that are new, innovative, and represent exciting growth drivers for us. For example, with this latest release, we have integrated additional AI capabilities including neural networks into Aspen Unified and Aspen HYSYS Dynamics Hybrid Models. These AI enhancements extend and build upon our ability to employ non-linear hybrid modeling in both traditional and sustainability related use cases to improve modeling accuracy. We have also incorporated generative AI based assistance into our strategic planning capabilities for sustainability pathways. This innovation helps to solve the cold start problem for users by using their queries or prompts to automatically create a new superstructure workflow, saving them time and allowing them to focus on more creative and high value of tasks. These are just a few examples of the way AspenTech is leveraging AI across our portfolio today. As always, our ability to leverage these innovations alongside the industry expertise and first principles know-how remains a competitive differentiator for us and highly valued by our customers. In closing, on Slide 8, we remain confident in our ability to deliver ACP growth of at least 11.5% year-over-year in fiscal 2024. Our confidence in reaffirming this guidance is primarily based on the following factors. First is the strength of our pipeline resulting from a positive macro environment, resilient demand and sales channel expansion. Second, the adoption of the DGM suite term licensing model is accelerating in the market and contributing to increasing growth. Third, the SSE suite and its tokenization continues to gain momentum in the market. Fourth, is the continued demand strength for our engineering suite, driven by upstream and sustainability CapEx. And fifth and final, an expanded sales channel will have a greater impact on pipeline conversion in the second half of the fiscal year. Specifically, on Q3, we now expect sequential ACV growth in the mid to high 3% range. This accounts for the closing of the delayed renewal agreement mentioned earlier, as well as the factors just referenced in support of our fiscal year guidance. Stronger Q3 and Q4 quarters are in line with our historical cadence as AspenTech's result have traditionally been more weighted to the second half of our fiscal year. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Chris for a discussion of our Q2 financial results. Chris? Thanks, Chris. As I mentioned earlier, we recognize that we need two strong quarters of growth in the second half to achieve our fiscal 2024 guidance targets. We believe that we're in a good position to deliver on this outcome. Our confidence is supported by the factors we laid out today. We're also excited by the growth potential of our innovation efforts. Across our portfolio, we continue to roll out new and enhanced capabilities to help our customers better meet their efficiency and sustainability objectives. As global leaders in industrial software, AspenTech has a long track record of partnering closely with customers to understand their needs, support their digitalization efforts, and drive positive business outcomes. We remain fully committed to this work going forward. With that, we will open it up for Q&A. Operator? Hi, Rob. Well, I mean, like, first of all, we remain to our guidance, which it's always been at least 11.5% and that is the goal. And time will tell what that means, but at least 11.5% over that number. Look, with regards to how weighted this year is to the second half, first of all, of course, that delayed renewal, which is about 0.6 points of growth, and unfortunately through complications and internal alignment and administrative issues with that customer, that deal didn't get renewed on time. This isn't the first time that something like this happens. This is certainly the largest deal that we've had to experience that with. Normally, it's much smaller transactions, but it's not unusual, and this is the first time that we'll probably have to disclose something like this. With regards to our confidence on the second half, look, it starts with the volume of the pipeline. Our pipeline over the last 12 months, January to January, our total pipeline for the company has grown over 30% and this is certainly supported by the channel sales expansion, but also by the macro environment that we see, the demand from our customers, and certainly the market leadership position of our products. But more specifically, look, we're very excited about the fact that now after 18 months, some of the transformation initiatives that we started working at the beginning of fiscal 2023 are starting to bear fruit. The outcome for DGM on term software licensing in the first half of the year was a great outcome. The term software pipeline for DGM is expanding very rapidly. As a matter of fact, it's grown by almost 500% in the last 12 months, and the majority of our customers are now accepting term software. So we're very excited about that, and we have a positive outlook for the DGM suite for the full year. Equally, the transformation of the SSE suite into a token suite, they used to do term deals, mostly one-year deals, now it's tokens, and we're expanding the duration of those deals. It continues to gain momentum. This is gaining the attention of our customers, but look, I also believe it's catching the attention of our competition, because it is starting to eat into the market position of some of our competitors. So we're also very excited about SSE, and we also have a positive outlook for that suite for the full year. Look, equally, the growth that we're seeing on the engineering suite that started last year, last fiscal year, but has continued this year and we expect it to continue through the full fiscal year is very exciting. It's driven by both the cap expand, but also sustainability cap expand, and we expect that suite to perform very well for the full fiscal year and most likely above planned. And then, look, we now have an expanded sales team that's in place for the most part that is now familiar with our motion and cadences, and we expect them to be very, very engaged converting that pipeline here in Q3, Q4. But I also want to say the following, because in a way, with Heritage AspenTech, after 40 years of taking those products to market, we relied on volume to deliver our results in the past, and once in a while we had deals of significant size. What we are now seeing with DGM and SSE is that we have a larger number of more sizable deals in our pipeline that come through as a result of the spend that utilities have to put in place in order to upgrade their systems. These are very large systems that required a lot of software and technology. Therefore, the size of these deals is seven figures and sometimes deep in the seven figures. And with SSE, we're also seeing deals that are larger than historically had deal. So when we look at our pipeline, it's not only volume but also size, especially as we talk specifically Q3 and Q4. So there are many reasons for this. As I said, very excited about what I see going forward. And of course, we know that we need to hit on all cylinders to deliver Q3 and Q4 and my expectation is that we will. Yes. Aramco is one of my \u2013 our most important customers. We've had \u2013 we've been doing business with Aramco for probably 30 years. Certainly, with SSE relationship has expanded with Aramco. But look, it's a relationship that existed and spend that existed before they announced that we're going to expand their production from 12 million to 13 million barrels. And now that they've announced that they're going to not do it and stay at 12 million barrels. I don't think it changes our outlook for Aramco. As a matter of fact, Aramco has been a heavy user of our engineering suite. And in my prepared remarks, I talked about the opportunities or advantages that our customers are seeing from leveraging the synergies around the engineering suite and the SSE suite. So we're engaged with Aramco. And furthermore, what I will say is that on a global basis, oil and gas companies have to replace 4 million to 5 million barrels of oil production every year because of depletion in their reservoirs. So there is a lot of CapEx that has to be put to work to just maintain production, let alone increase it. So we're still very optimistic about our outlook in the Middle East overall. Thank you, Rob. Hi, Matt. Just slightly \u2013 slightly higher in the second half. If you were to put that deal back into Q2, it's just a few percentage points higher at the second half, but nothing that material. Yes. Look, I think this is something that we remain very focused on. This is the reason why we continue to progress building the implementation services partner network that \u2013 that we talked about already 12, 18 months ago. But also equally, part of that demand is new business that we're generating in other regions of the world and we're setting up teams in those regions as well, including developing these partnerships. So we're confident in our ability to meet the demand, working closely and collaborating with these customers as these agreements get signed and the implementation plans get defined. Yes, thank you. Hi, Mark. Yes. Well \u2013 so Mark, just for reasons of confidentiality and considering that our friendly competitors may always be listening, we won't talk about the geography, what technologies or products this is about. As we said, it's about \u2013 it's a renewal that got delayed, it's about $5.4 million in value. We expect that it will close in Q3. We have a very detailed sequence of events, and we are about three quarters through the sequence of event already. So we expect that transaction to close in Q3. Yes. Look, I think in the first 12 months of the commercial agreement, mostly fiscal 2023, as we learned about each other, it became clear that focus was going to be very important in succeeding initially in the partnership. So we have \u2013 we are targeting very specific areas of engagement, both areas like pharma, but also areas where Emerson has a lot of strength in their businesses, whether it's geographies, whether it's types of projects that they pursue and other areas where Emerson has a very strong presence and also non-traditional industries for AspenTech. We've been very focused on that in this fiscal year. Our efforts are very targeted in that regard. And we believe that this is paying off and will pay off more handsomely in the future as we ramp up those go-to-market activities. Yes. Thank you, Mark. Hi, Jason. Yes. No. Look, actually, we're very excited about what we're hearing and seeing. Oil and gas CapEx are more or less in line to last year or up depending on the customer segment or geography. And by that, I mean, probably 5% to 10%, but mostly in line with last year, which was healthy and good for our business. Refining customers equally, CapEx spending in line with what they've traditionally done and what they did last year. Chemicals is more of the same. So we don't expect a recovery in the spend \u2013 OpEx spend by chemical customers. In calendar 2024 the fact is that the sort of soft patch that they are going through will probably extend through the full calendar year. And then utilities, look, utilities more and more CapEx is being targeted at global electrification and in that utilities. But part of that CapEx in global electrification is going into renewables, whether it's solar and wind. But that renewable \u2013 that electricity produced from renewables has to be put into or connected into the grid. And therefore, utilities then have to spend to upgrade their systems, deal with the complexity of more and more renewable energy electricity into their networks. And this is one of the main drivers for them to have to spend to upgrade their systems. We're very excited about what we were hearing from utilities. And look, it used to be a very sort of a steady-state industry 30, 40 years ago. Today it is an incredibly exciting industry. It's an industry that absolutely will have to rely on technology to deal with the complexity of the grid to maintain the grid imbalance and in operation but also to cybersecurity. And our conversations not only about delivering our software to these customers, but also co-innovating and accelerating co-innovation because part of \u2013 one of the challenges that if you talk to utilities customers is they feel that there needs to be an acceleration of innovation for them to keep up with the complexity that they're having to manage. So we're very excited about this over the last 12, 18 months and especially the last six months of last calendar year, I traveled to main utility customers around the world. Not only am I excited about what I just mentioned, but also about the role that now new AspenTech with the DGM suite plays around global electrification and global infrastructure. AspenTech and the Monarch SCADA system in the DGM suite is responsible not only for managing, but keeping the electrical grid in balance for the entire country of India, for example, but also the entire country of Vietnam, but also for Southern California, the lights in Southern California are kept on through the use of our outsource technology and systems. 40% of utilities in the United States are using now the DGM products and solutions that AspenTech is key to them. But also we've made great progress moving into Europe. And now we're going to be basically the foundation technology for multiple countries in Europe and certainly in the Netherlands, TenneT is a well-known installation that's been going on for two, three years now. But we've also won business in two or three other countries where our technology is going to be the base technology to run the grid in those countries. And I won't mention them because just recently signed agreements but equally, our expansion into Latin America, we run the largest transmission network in Latin America using our technology, the entire gas distribution network in Spain is run using the Monarch SCADA system in the DGM suite. And look, every time we win a deal we're displacing the competition. we're displacing industrial that have been in the market for many years, but now their solutions having kept up with the needs of the industry. And this is then where OSI and now AspenTech are stepping into the bridge and being very successful. So we're very excited about what we're seeing with DGM. I think this is a game-changing suite for us. And as I said, it's not only the volume but also the size of deals. And I think that's part of what gives us confidence about the success we're going to have in Q3 and Q4. Well, look, I don't want to confirm or deny that deal that slipped, is a chemical deal. We haven't said anything about what vertical it is in. But putting that aside, look, as we said, certainly, the MSC suite, what we'll say is that deal certainly is a transaction that is all MSC software. So, that impacted the performance of the MSC suite in the first half of the year. Chemicals was a little flat. So, we do expect a stronger performance for MSC in the second half of the year. APM has continued to behave in the same manner that it has now for a couple of years. But we're also excited about our performance in engineering because we do think that we'll be able to make up if necessary, for any shortfall that we may see around MSC or APM. But our goal is to get certainly the MSC suite to plan and, if possible, also APM. And look, what we're seeing with DGM and SSE is also exciting. So overall, we were confident there's work to do here. We're going to execute and we have two quarters to do at least 11.5%. Nay Soe, you are breaking up. You are not coming through. Operator, I think we lost Nay Soe. Hi, Arsenije. No, look Arsenije, the specifics around these deals that didn't renew have nothing to do with the macro environment or demand. It's just some internal issues and administrative issues with this customer. We thought the deal was going to get renewed and it didn't. So it will happen now in Q3. So nothing to do with demand at all. Look, what gives us confidence, we've said it. A pipeline, the strength that we're seeing in DGM, SSE Engineering, a bigger sales organization that is now in place to convert that pipeline. So overall, those are the factors that we think will get us there. Let me first address the question on DGM, and then I'll have Chris talk about that impact, but if any. Look, 2.5 points is the goal. 2.5 points of growth contribution is the goal for DGM. Hopefully, we'll exceed it, but we'll keep that as the goal for the moment. The pipeline looks solid, but let's see what we get to at the end of Q4. Hi, Clarke. Yes. Look, as you would expect, certainly a significant portion of the sales investment went into DGM, the expansion of the sales organization in DGM into other regions, but also in North America. Expansion of the high velocity sales organization are small to medium sales team because we're seeing accelerated growth in that team, so that team also benefited from an important expansion in the headcount. That team is pursuing mostly engineering business that comes through consulting, engineering consulting companies or companies that are first customers of AspenTech \u2013 first-time customers of AspenTech. This is a team that has obtained companies like Tesla, Meta, Google to be customers of AspenTech. So there's a very active team and a team that has grown materially for us over the last two, three years. But also we added especially solution consultants in our Heritage AspenTech team as we focus also on driving more enterprise-type deals with our customers in that area, considering the critical mass of business that we already have with some of these customers, we believe there's an opportunity there for us to do more with those customers. And a little bit of as we reorganize SSE into our head sales organization, we've also made a little bit of investments to the SSE team as well. Yes. Well, I mean, look at the \u2013 we're pretty much done with expansion in fiscal 2024, that, that this investment cycle started in Q4 of fiscal 2023, so last April, nine months ago, we're done. Most of the sales headcount is in place. It's been in place for a number of months. So this is why we expect to see \u2013 we're seeing the benefit on the pipeline and we expect to see the benefit on the conversion. Now, having said that, now for fiscal 2025 coming up, we'll look at what investments we need to make around expanding the DGM sales organization into other parts of the world and what other sort of tweak investments we have to make in other parts of the sales organization. But this was an important ramp up in headcount, and now we also want to see that additional headcount increase in productivity. So good investment, a little bit more investment in fiscal 2025 around DGM and a few other areas. And look, now that I talked about pipeline and conversion, there was a question just before about the conversion rate for our pipeline. Look, the \u2013 we tracked certainly the conversion rate for our pipeline quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, and we expect that the historical range of conversion that we've seen in order to deliver our goals is what we need to have in Q3, Q4 to achieve at least 11.5%. So we do \u2013 the team does a good job of tracking the performance against historical and as a forebearer of what's going to come. Thank you. Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. Over the coming months, we will attend two investor conferences. In February, we're going to attend the Wolfe Investor Conference, and in March, we will attend the KeyBanc Emerging Technology Summit. So please reach out to our Investor Relations team for more information on these two events, and we look forward to catching up with many of you soon. Thank you, everyone, for joining, and we will see you on the road. Thank you."

After the speakers' presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Brian Denyeau from ICR. Please go ahead.\nBrian Denyeau: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 ending September 30, 2023. With me on the call today are Antonio Pietri, AspenTech\u2019s President and CEO; and Chantelle Breithaupt, AspenTech\u2019s CFO. Please note, we have posted an earnings presentation on our IR website and we ask that investors refer to this presentation in conjunction with today's call. Starting on Slide 2, I want to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today\u2019s press release and in our annual report on Form 10-K and other subsequent filings made with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this presentation, we present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today\u2019s earnings press release and investor presentation, both of which are available on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks, Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Beginning on Slide 3, these are the four key takeaways for today's call. First, Q1 was a solid quarter, which once again delivered double digit ACV growth. We have hit the ground running to start the new fiscal year, shifting our focus from integration and transformation to execution and expansion. Second, demand remains strong in most end markets. More than ever, our products and solutions are mission critical and uniquely positioned to help customers meet their profitability and sustainability objectives. Third, we continue to see promising signs of growth across many different sustainability pathways that are expanding our market opportunity. We are highly encouraged about the potential to help new and existing customers achieve their sustainability objectives through partnership, collaboration and co-innovation in different use cases. And fourth, we remain confident in our ability to deliver against our guidance targets for the full fiscal year. Our ability to generate double digit ACV growth and expand free cash flow margins while also making strategic investments for growth is a great example of the scalability of our business model. Looking at our quarterly results in more detail, Annual Contract Value or ACV was $898 million, increasing 10.9% year-over-year and free cash flow was $16 million. As I stated last quarter, our cash flow is generally lowest in Q1 due to the seasonality of cash collections in our business. Turning to Slide 4, I will now provide an update on the dynamics we're seeing in our end markets, where demand remains strong excluding chemicals. In upstream and midstream energy, customers are experiencing favorable market conditions and healthy demand growth with recent acquisition announcements by U.S. oil majors demonstrating their confidence in the industry's long-term prospects. Strong demand combined with a persistently tight supply environment has led to higher oil prices and increased upstream CapEx investments, especially from national oil companies. CapEx investment is not only targeted at increasing oil supply, but also at sustaining existing production rates as the depletion rate of oil fields is a major area of focus. With the addition of the SEC suite, we can now offer an even more compelling lifecycle solution to manage and optimize the entire value chain. And we expect demand in these markets to remain positive for AspenTech going forward. In refining, while margins have fluctuated over the last three months, they remain strong as industry players benefit from a combination of increasing demand for fuels and capacity rationalization in Europe and North America. These same owner-operators remain focused on extending asset lifespans and reducing emissions through CapEx and OpEx investments, targeting improvements in operational efficiencies where digitalization plays a fundamental role. We remain well positioned to support refiners with their initiatives through our ability to drive higher efficiency and therefore improve sustainability. E&C customers are benefiting from positive CapEx trends in both traditional energy and energy transition projects driving higher pipeline and industry optimism. As we have mentioned in the past we believe that sustainability initiatives will ultimately support faster and less cyclical growth than we have seen historically in this end market. We're encouraged by the trends we see with the with the E&C customers and expect they will continue. The environment for chemicals remains consistent with the first half of this calendar year as industry players manage operating costs to support margins in response to weaker demand. While this is impacting our growth in the chemicals market, chemicals customers remain interested in AspenTech solutions to help drive efficiencies, reduce emissions and plastic waste and accelerate the development of the circular economy. This gives us confidence that we will deliver faster growth from this vertical as market conditions improve. Finally, demand in the power T&D industry remains robust as the industry benefits from an immense and ongoing investment cycle to expand, modernize and strengthen the grid. This is being driven by increasing consumer and industrial demand for electricity, rapid adoption of renewables and significant government funding. For example, the International Energy Agencies or IEA's most recent update to its net zero road map for 2050 predict that $680 billion in global annual grid investment is needed by 2030 to meet the expected increase in electricity demand. The IEA also predicted that nearly 70% of this investment will be used for distribution grids with the aim of expanding and strengthening and digitalizing networks, all of which were well prepared to help support through our DGM suite. We're bullish on the long-term growth potential of this market and it remains a key strategic area for investment going forward. Turning to Slide 5, I'd like to provide an update on our sales efforts as we kicked off the year. As I highlighted on Slide 3, we're making investments to increase sales capacity in both new and existing markets. We believe this investment combined with our Emerson commercial relationship will enable us to capitalize on the numerous growth opportunities we see across our business in the years ahead. We began this process in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and have made significant progress in these efforts since then. We expect to start benefiting from this additional capacity towards the end of fiscal 2024 and realize its full impact in fiscal 2025 and beyond. I'd now like to provide some additional color around software transactions closed in the quarter. Our customers continue to recognize the exceptional value and breadth of our innovation for their businesses, both to meet their needs today and their long-term development objectives. As a result, we have continued to win new business while also deepening our relationships with existing customers. The first customer reference is a world leader in industrial gases that is in the process of expanding from its traditional role in the production of industrial gases to become a leader in the production of green hydrogen. As part of this journey, this customer is using our software to design next generation process technology and estimate investment cost for green hydrogen, green ammonia and renewables. This customer doubled their engineering suite token entitlement as foundational technology for their ambitious growth objectives with plans to explore further standardization on our offerings going forward. The second customer is a leading refiner that decided to more than double their business with us citing its condition and the capabilities of our engineering suite and intention to explore additional use cases in alternative fuel development. This latest transaction built on our long-standing relationship with the customer and we're excited to continue partnering with them going forward. Third, for DGM we secured a large scale perpetual license transaction with a U.S. power utility. The utility was in search of a better way to manage its transmission network and recognizing the strength of our monarch platform chose us over the incumbent following a competitive process. This customer is interested in additional DGM Suite products and we plan to continue working with them to expand the relationship going forward. The fourth and final reference is from our collaboration with Emerson where we displaced an incumbent in the pulp and paper business of a leading global manufacturer. Emerson's existing relationship with this customer through its DeltaV install base provided valuable insights into its evaluation process and helped us identify that the value of our adaptive process control technology for more efficient and sustainable plant operations would be a key differentiator. We see room for expansion across this customer's asset base and remain confident in our ability to continue partnering with Emerson in pursuits going forward. Moving to Slide 6, I would like to provide an update on the sustainability opportunities we're seeing. The global mega trends of the energy transition and net zero targets continue to drive significant investment into the development of existing and novel technologies that can scale to achieve customers net zero ambitions. As a result, customers interest in our solution to support this type of sustainability projects is growing. This is manifested through ongoing CapEx spend, which drives increased interest and use in our engineering suite and represents most of our growth in this market today. These assets are still in their initial design phase. However, overtime we expect to see a benefit from sustainability related projects in our manufacture and supply chain and asset performance management suites as well, since we provide customer value across the entire asset life cycle from the basic design phase to asset operation and maintenance. The customer reference mentioned a moment ago around green hydrogen is an excellent example of these land-and-expand opportunities and we continue to see many other compelling projects in different areas of sustainability. We also won in the quarter several sustainability related opportunities through our high velocity sales team. These wins included companies still in their initial startup journeys and later stage companies that have advanced into the testing and development stages of a specific sustainability use cases. By leveraging our technology, these companies are developing solutions in areas such as carbon capture, plastics recycling, green hydrogen, renewable fuels and batteries. We're excited about the potential to help them scale up their digitalization initiatives going forward. Turning to Slide 7, I will now provide an update on our innovation initiatives. In Q1, we continued to drive innovation across our portfolio to help customers run their assets safer, greener, longer and faster, resulting in the planned release of enhancements to our current V14 software and a new V14.2 update later this month. These upgrades will include new machine learning and newer net capabilities across many of our products to enhance their hybrid modeling functionality. Expansion of our sustainability application library and product integration for Emerson Ovation power generation control system among other areas. We also remain focused on helping our partners reach their sustainability goals through co-innovation in the quarter. For example, we have completed the productization of the technology license from Aramco, Architect 3 to be released as Aspen's strategic planning for sustainability pathways. This product holds significant potential to help our customers make more informed decisions in their carbon management strategies and over time, it should also incorporate capabilities to help customers better navigate multiple other sustainability pathways. In its initial release the product will simultaneously consider economics, process design and operating constraints to help customers optimize their carbon management strategies. Additionally, as announced this afternoon, we're expanding our relationship with OMV Group, a multinational, integrated energy company based in Austria to accelerate the company's energy transition initiatives. As a first step in this partnership, we will focus on the renewable fuel optimization strategy by helping them better leverage their industrial data and develop a simplified integrated supply chain model across OMV's fuels and chemical supply chain. Now turning to Slide 8, I will discuss our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We remain confident in our ability to deliver ACV growth of at least 11.5% and free cash flow of at least $360 million. Industry demand for greater operational efficiency coupled with higher investment levels to support sustainability goals and energy transition initiatives is driving strong demand for our innovation. Macro trends remain consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year and we're closely monitoring the ongoing conflict in the Middle East for any potential impact on market dynamics which so far has been minimal. I would also like to give an update on the AspenTech team in Israel. Our priority has been the physical and mental safety of our team members there. We remain focused on these and we will continue to make sure we're doing all that we can to support our affected employees. We also want to extend our heartfelt condolences to all those directly and indirectly impacted by this event in Israel and throughout the region. Lastly, as announced a few weeks ago, Chantelle will be stepping down from her role here as CFO at the end of December. Chantelle has been a great partner to me and a leader for the organization. On behalf of the entire team here at AspenTech, I'd like to thank her for her many contributions and wish here all the best in the next chapter of her career. We have full confidence in Chris Stagno, SVP and Chief Accounting Officer to step into the interim CFO role after Chantelle's departure should we need additional time to complete our search for a permanent CFO. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Chantelle for a discussion of our Q1 financial results. Chantelle?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you for the kind words, Antonio. It has been a privilege to serve as CFO for the past two and a half years at AspenTech. I am highly appreciative of your leadership, vision and commitment to the company. I am proud of what we have accomplished and I'm very confident in AspenTech's ability to continue delivering strong top and bottom line growth going forward. I remain committed to working with Antonio, Chris and the entire team to ensure a successful transition. Turning to our Q1 performance, I'd like to start out by highlighting that our earnings presentation includes explanations regarding the impact of ASC Topic 606 on our financial results. We have also included definitions of Annual Contract Value or ACV, bookings and free cash flow among other metrics in our earnings presentation now available on our IR website. We ask that investors refer to these definitions together with today's call. Starting on Slide 9, annual contract value was $898 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, up 10.9% year-over-year and 1.4% quarter-over-quarter. As a reminder, Q1 typically sees the lowest number of transactions closed given our historical sales cadence. In addition, ACV performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 included one-time transformation and integration benefits from SSE and our acquisition of Inmation, which together represented approximately $10 million of net new ACV or 1.3 points of sequential growth in Q1 of fiscal 2023. Total bookings were $212 million in the first quarter, decreasing 5.4% year-over-year. As a reminder, bookings are impacted by the timing of renewals, which were down year-over-year, consistent with expectations. We expect $131 million in bookings up for renewal in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue was $249 million for the first quarter, which was approximately flat on a year-over-year basis. Please note that revenue in our model is heavily impacted by contract renewal timing and variability under ASC topic 606. Now turning to profitability, on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the impact of stock based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and acquisition and integration planning related fees, we reported operating income of $78 million in Q1 representing a 31% non-GAAP operating margin compared to a non-GAAP operating income of $93 million for a 37% non-GAAP operating margin a year ago. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period-to-period due to the timing of customer renewals and the resulting impact on license revenue recognition in a given quarter. Additionally, on expenses, please note that the increase was driven by increased headcount and compensation costs in line with Antonio's commentary around our expansion initiatives in fiscal 2024. This increase in expenses was expected and is consistent with our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Non-GAAP net income was $75 million in the quarter or $1.16 per share compared to non-GAAP net income of $142 million or $2.20 per share a year ago. Please note that the difference in non-GAAP net income between periods was mainly due to a lower benefit from income taxes in the first quarter compared to a year ago, driven by the change in our approach to computing our tax provision which originally occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $121 million of cash and cash equivalents, reflecting the impact of share repurchase under our $300 million share repurchase program. In addition, we had $198 million available on our revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 580,000 shares for $114 million under our $300 million share repurchase authorization announced in fiscal year 2024. We also settled our $100 million accelerated share repurchase program in the quarter to receive an additional 107,000 shares. Please note that the $100 million ASR program was paid for in full in fiscal 2023. For cash flow, we generated $17 million of cash from operations and $16 million of free cash flow in the quarter compared to $5 million in cash from operations and $4 million in free cash flow a year ago. As Antonio noted, this was in line with our expectations as Q1 has historically been our lowest cash flow quarter due to the amount of cash available for collection in the period. Turning to Slide 10, I would now like to close with guidance. For the full year of fiscal 2024 we are reiterating our outlook across all metrics. This includes at least 11.5% of ACV growth and a free cash flow target of at least $360 million for the period. We continue to expect total bookings of at least $1.04 billion with $580 million of bookings up for renewal in fiscal 2024. Our non-GAAP EPS range has increased by $0.06 [ph] from our prior guide to reflect the impact of our share repurchase activity in the first quarter on shares outstanding. There is no impact to GAAP EPS. For a complete overview of our fiscal 2024 guidance, please refer to our earnings press release and presentation available on our IR website. As investors think about linearity for the remainder of the year, we continue to expect a cadence consistent with our historical performance. This includes fiscal 2023 when adjusting for the one-time contributions from SSE Inmation in Q1 that I discussed earlier. We expect to generate net new ACV in the low 60% range in the second half of fiscal 2024. In addition, we expect that we will begin to see the impact from our sales investments in the second half of fiscal 2024 consistent with the assumptions we provided around our fiscal year 2024 guidance on our last quarterly earnings call. Please refer to Slide 13 of our earnings presentation for a detailed overview of our linearity expectations. To wrap up, we delivered a solid start to fiscal year 2024. We remain on track to meet our full year targets while also strategically investing in different areas that are supportive of our long-term growth objectives. We believe AspenTech is in a great position to benefit from many of the largest and most important investment trends impacting asset intensive industries today, which should support our ability to generate attractive levels of growth and profitability for the foreseeable future. With that, I will turn it back over to Antonio for closing comments.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, Chantelle. Q1 was a solid quarter where we once again delivered double digit ACV growth. Following our initial foundation building year, we have shifted focus to execution and expansion in fiscal year 2024. We're investing in areas that can drive our growth while also managing our expenses for a return to best-in-class profitability overtime. We're pleased to report that demand remains resilient for our mission critical solutions across most end markets. We also continue to see encouraging signs of growth in different areas of sustainability as I have touched on today. Our team is clearly energized to continue helping our customers with their sustainability initiatives going forward and we remain confident in our fiscal year 2024 guidance targets. With that, we will open it up for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Matthew Pfau with William Blair. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Matt.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Hi, Matt.\nMatthew Pfau: Hey, Antonio and Chantelle. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask on some of the momentum you're seeing with sustainability, CapEx and investments. Is there any way to size how much new business is being driven by these initiatives and how does that compare to perhaps a year ago?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, Matt. Let me address that and then Chantelle can add her thoughts as well. So we have an initiative internally to certainly first of all size the opportunity, the total addressable market that we believe will come to us from sustainability, CapEx investments and eventually OpEx as well as these plans are built, our manufacturing supply chain and APM solutions will play a role in all of that. Now in in the near-term what we're seeing is opportunities in sustainability and different use cases flowing through our inside sales organization, our high velocity sales organization and the benefit that we're seeing is from CapEx investments and the initial front end engineering design for those assets. We're also seeing a little bit of MSC opportunities for customers that already have facilities that that that are running. Our advanced control technology again seems to be a target for some of these customers. But in general we do have a sense today for the amount of business that sustainability is generating and this is the reason for the investments that we're targeting in our high velocity sales organization which are specifically to really position us better to capture that opportunity in that market and eventually over the -- throughout the broader market that we have.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. I think the only thing I would add Antonio to your point is yes, definitely in specifics Matt, such as the high velocity sales that Antonio referred to, those are specific measures and that a more macro level for us, the engineering suites where we look first and then that eventually falls into MSC as we build out land-and-expand. And our engineering suite saw the strongest growth it has out of 13 quarters. Last quarter we said engineering was the strongest out of 12. This is even stronger and up 13. So that's where we see it at a macro sweet level. And then Antonio had some specifics there that that kind of bolster it together.\nMatthew Pfau: Great, very helpful. And then I wanted to just perhaps get an update on how you're thinking about acquisitions now that it seems like the Emerson integration is going well and also the Micromine acquisition has gone away?\nAntonio Pietri: Go ahead Chantelle.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes, we're still committed to M&A in the sense of it's still a part of what we're looking for and focused on. I think that we have everything from tuck-in to larger pieces from that perspective Matt. We've remain committed to pursuing them as primary use of our capital and I think that we're waiting to see, we can't always time the market but we have, we definitely have a list of things from tuck-ins to larger that we're looking at. So it's still a good part of our capital allocation strategy.\nMatthew Pfau: Great. I appreciate you taking my questions. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks.\nOperator: Please stand by for the next question. The next question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Rob.\nRob Oliver: Hi, Antonio. Hi, Chantalle. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two. One, I was wondering if you could provide an update for us that you guys obviously got through a big period of last fiscal year in the SSE business with the contract timings and now you're moving into that conversion from legacy perpetual to term and I know that is expected to be a contributor to ACV growth this year. So I know we're only one quarter in, but just wanted to see if I can get an update on how that is progressing so far? And then I had a quick followup.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, let me take that. So look, the way the year flowed last year with SSE, certainly an important transformation benefit in the Q1 fiscal 2023 quarter as we cleaned up distances and we aligned the recognition of the spend in those contracts to our ACV policy. A lot of the renewals happened in the Q3 fiscal 2023 quarter. So we expect the Q3 fiscal 2024 quarter to be a big quarter for SSE and a quarter where we've been -- we hope to see the results from our focus on growing and expanding the SSE business. Of course, the growth is what will have an impact on ACV, but we're also targeting to expand the term length, which would have a benefit on the revenue side of the equation. But look, we're excited about SSE, especially with national oil companies we're seeing a lot of investment, CapEx investment flowing for oil and gas. And it's not only, as I said on the call, it's not only to increase production, but to replace a production that is naturally lost as oilfields deplete. And then is the use of SSE around carbon capture sequestration, also geothermal energies, we are engaged with a couple of customers as well starting the possibility using SSE to also store hydrogen in the subsurface as a storage resource. So we're optimistic about SSE and the potential that we see. But all the work that we're doing right now, we expect to see it in the Q3 and Q4 quarters as we focus on most of the renewals that we have for SSE.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. And I think that the other -- one other thing I would add too is that from a model perspective, Rob, we're seeing, we're pleased with the initial kind of conversations on tokenization. So you mentioned perp to term, and then SSE is now doing term to token, and we're pleased with how that tokenization conversations are going. That's the only thing I would add as well as far as progressing the transformation agenda.\nRob Oliver: Great, helpful. That's really helpful color from both. Thank you. And then Antonio, just one followup for you. I appreciated your comments, not seeing any impact from what's going on in the Middle East. And I know last quarter you had made some comments relative to China and Russia and I think Russia, you guys kind of moved to renewals only and China was slow. I just would be curious to hear an update on those two geographies from you. Thank you very much.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, on Russia, as you said, last quarter, we announced that we're going to move to a renewals-only business, and that is the case. And we're working renewals, some renewals already happened in Q1 and will continue to happen. And look, we also continue to monitor sanctions there just to make sure that we comply with any requirements from the U.S. government. On China, look, China is interesting in that our business continues to grow in China. Certainly, the Chinese government is driving an emphasis on local sourcing for technologies, meaning by local companies, Chinese companies. But we also see Chinese customers continue to buy our technology, which I believe speaks to the innovation and differentiation that still exists between what we do and our products and any native locally developed capabilities in the country there. So...\nRob Oliver: I appreciate that. Thank you very much.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Hi, this is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. I was kind of wondering a little bit more about the competitive displacement you had at that DeltaV customer. Is there understood that you're sort of saying expect the ACV contributions from the Emerson channel to ramp more in the back half? But is there a way of helping put sort of the number of Emerson-driven opportunities that are in the pipeline today? In context, how is that versus a year ago? Just help us an investors better understand how that opportunity is building?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, sure. I mean, look, let me first say that a lot of work and a lot of goodness happened in fiscal 2023. We -- what I would say is, we synchronized the two organizations on what was possible, considering the trajectories of the two companies in their own markets. We now in fiscal 2024 expect to start seeing some of that benefit, and the reference that you mentioned is an example. What excites me and excites all of us is the huge installed base of systems that Emerson has in the market, not only in our core market, but in other markets, as you saw. That was a pulp and paper reference, which is typically not a market that AspenTech pursuits. So a huge installed base of DeltaV systems, huge installed base of Asian systems in power. Huge installed base of maintenance systems, Emerson maintenance technology capabilities that we believe are also opportunities for our asset performance management solution and especially the Mtell solution. The AspenTech organization now has access to all that installed base. It's engaged with the Emerson sales organization and the different account teams. And from a standpoint of estimating the opportunity, you need to look at the Emerson installed base and then you would have to determine what is the possibility there for AspenTech. But we also know that customers are very excited about what's possible between AspenTech and Emerson. And this is something that we'll be talking about during our global conference coming up at the end of April next year. So more to come, but it's about their installed base and then how AspenTech can be accelerated into that installed base.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you. And then were there any sort of meaningful levels of digital grid management perpetual license bookings this quarter? And just an update on the pipeline, how the customer receptivity is for term license proposals that you're putting across the table?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, the fact is that we -- we exceeded our expectations for the quarter around perpetual licenses for DGM. That continues to be a play for us. This is a transition that will happen over many years. Some customers are more willing to go to term than others. But what I want to emphasize is that certainly, a perpetual license contributes to revenue, contributes to upfront free cash flow, but it also generates GACV from the maintenance support that is in those agreements. And that's normally somewhere around 19% of the licenses, the perpetual licenses. So while, of course, eventually, we will prefer to have all that business be term, there is an important benefit from perpetual licenses that is reflected in the growth expectations for DGM in the year. But look, our pipeline is supporting both perpetual licenses and term. What I'll say about term, it's a new licensing model for customers. There's \u2013 like it happened with HAT, it was the beginning in 2009, 14 years ago. Customers have to get familiar with the model, have to get familiar with the terms and conditions. And therefore, that aspect of the negotiations takes a little longer. We saw good business in the quarter, and we have good engagement around term deals as well. So look, this is a transition that will happen over many years, but good benefits overall.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you. And if I could squeeze one more in. So if I understood your sustainability comments around the high velocity sales force, you're starting to sign up engineering and construction firms for incremental tokens around these projects today, and you expect that to build as you go through the year?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. We find EPCs to be very bullish about the -- how sustainability CapEx is flowing to them. And therefore, it's driving more use of tokens. One of the customer references that we talked about, while that customer is not an EPC, they've made a very strategic decision to focus on growing green hydrogen. And they doubled their entitlement with AspenTech. This is a seven-figure doubling of entitlement. So that benefit is absolutely now flowing through our growth, and we expect it to continue to be more and more so going forward.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Jason.\nDevin Au: Hey Antonio, hey Chantelle, it's actually Devin on for Jason tonight. Thanks for taking our questions. Just want to start off, I just want to get a little more detail on the ACV growth and in the quarter. I mean it decelerated a little bit on a year-over-year basis. And when I look at kind of the balance of the year, I think you mentioned expecting SSE to have a pretty big second half. But any other commentary you can share on just what's giving you the confidence that ACV growth is really going to accelerate in the back half year?\nAntonio Pietri: Okay. Go ahead, Chantelle and I'll help you.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. I think to the point I've add any additional color, when you take the current -- the Q1 period year-over-year, if you look at -- if you remove the onetime benefits of the SSE commercial transformation and Inmation, we actually had a 1% growth in Q1 last year versus the 1.4%. So if you look at organic growth, it's actually expansion of 1% to 1.4%, which I think is really critical from a run the business operational perspective and we're pleased with that underlying growth. If you look at the remainder of the year, there are several things we're confident in, and I'm sure Antonio will add some color. But everything from the SSE terminals in Q3, the sales productivity ramping that we talked about, the investment in Q4 last year, Q1 this year. The benefit of the DGM pipeline growing in the sense of both the pipeline term and aftermarket sales and then traditionally HAT has had stronger linearity in the second half. So we see quite a few factors. And Antonio, if you want to add any color to those five things?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. I mean, Chantelle is right. Look -- we're excited. I'm very excited about what's happening here. Of course, there's a lot of foundation building and now expansion because, in a way, AspenTech accelerated from $700 million to $1.1 billion in revenue and the related ACV overnight. So now it's expansion. If you look at Q1, as Chantelle said, look, in Q1 2023, there were benefits from transformation of SSE, significant benefits and then the Inmation inorganic benefit. On an apples-to-apples basis, it's a 40% improvement in the performance in the Q1 quarter versus last year. But look, what excites me is, okay, we're starting to see the flow of sustainability benefit through our high velocity sales organization. But if you go to Europe, for example, our installed base of customers there are incredibly focused on sustainability. Today, we announced that press release related to our partnership with OMV in Austria and where they're doing around biofuels and synthetic fuels, but \u2013 but you also have many other customers working on this type of use cases. So they will believe also \u2013 there will be an important benefit to have, not only in engineering, but MSC as well, and I believe also in APM. SSE, significant sustainability benefits. If you look at DGM and as I travel around the world, and I have over the last 18 months, talking to DGM customers, the opportunity is incredible. Look, we manage our technology, manages the largest transportation grid in Latin America. We -- our technology is responsible for managing the entire gas distribution network of Spain. The entire India grid is managed by the Monarch technology, the entire India grid. This is the largest synchronous electrical network in the world in one country. And the opportunity in India, as I meet with customers and the successes that we've had over the last 12 months in Europe around transportation, but also distribution, the 40%-plus market share that we have for DGM in North America as well. And we're only getting started outside of North America. We're doubling our sales organization in the field outside of North America to pursue opportunities, and that will continue to happen in future years as well. And the expansion of HVS [ph] is about sustainability. So as we look at all the macro indicators, the quality of the technology that we have and the opportunity and the CapEx that are starting to flow around global electrification and sustainability is very exciting. So the point that Chantelle made, look, this is a year is 12 months and four quarters. We just completed our first quarter, and now we're excited about Q2, Q3 and Q4.\nDevin Au: Got it. Got it. I really appreciate the clarity here. Just one quick followup. I think last quarter, you also mentioned seeing some good cross-sell interest from your chemicals and refining customers and looking into some of the microgrid management capabilities. I'm just kind of curious if those cross-sell interest crystallized in the quarter or showing up more in the pipeline in the near term here? Thanks.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Yes. No, look, it will -- it is showing up in the pipeline and it will be down the road because the conversation started to happen really in the last six months to nine months around microgrids. I had a meeting with a customer in India last week that has been a customer of HAT for 30 years. And when they found out that our capabilities around microgrids, but more -- I think more importantly, the fact that we are now -- our technology is responsible for maintaining the India electrical grid imbalance. And in operations, I mean, our technology keeps the lights on in India. It was very exciting for that customer also the fact that we actually managed to transmit the distribution of electricity in some of the major cities in India. And therefore, that gives credence gives credibility to them, the capabilities that we can bring to bear around their own microgrids and their own utilities as they start incorporating renewables, as they start generating power from renewables because this customer is making a huge investment in solar power as well, even though there historically been chemical -- so petrochemical company. So this is also going to be an opportunity. But again, customers are only starting to learn about all of these, and those opportunities will be in the pipeline down the road.\nDevin Au: Great. That's great to hear. Thanks for taking my question.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, you're welcome.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Josh Tilton with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. \nAntonio Pietri: Hi Josh.\nArsenije Matovic: Hi, Antonio, hi Chantelle. This is Arsenije on for Josh. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at seasonality, you reiterated with the 60% range of net new ACV in second half, that implies a significant step up in 2Q. Can you elaborate on what provides confidence in that outlook, especially as a higher concentration of attrition as expected? Because I think it would be the largest 2Q quarterly net new ACV step-up and the second largest quarterly increase ever realized. And then just a brief followup. Thanks. \nAntonio Pietri: All right. Well, look, I think Chantelle reiterated some of the reasons why we think not only Q2 and by the way, yes, I know we talked about the linearity of the year and what it means for Q2, but there's also Q3 and Q4 here. Look, I think more immediately, it is starting to see the impact from the hiring, the incremental headcount that we've been putting into sales since the beginning of Q4. We made also significant progress in that area in Q1. And then our pipeline of business, this is something that is -- our pipeline is continuing to grow across all three sort of historical businesses, HAT, OSI and SSE. And then okay, Q3, we've talked about the SEC renewals and in general. But look, historically, Q2 is the end of a fiscal year for most of our customers in HAT, also customers in SSE, DGM. Frankly, we haven't seen any seasonality to DGM because of the way those opportunities flow, mostly RFPs in the initial projects and then aftermarket sales and by the way, something that I want to say about the DGM business. The sales cycle for new customers in DGM is very long. We talked about it, 12, 24 months. But there's a business, once you're installed, that is much more accelerated. The name of that sales team inside AspenTech is aftermarket. I'm sure we'll change that name at some point. But that business is a shorter sales cycle business, is add-on once you're installed is adding new applications or new capabilities to what's already installed. And that's an area we're significantly increasing headcount. Sales cycle there, it can even be three months, but more normally six to 12 months. So this is an area where we see the opportunity to accelerate growth because of the cyclicality and then the focus on the incremental headcount that we're seeing there. And we expect to see some of that benefit in Q2 as well. But I don't \u2013 linearity is important, of course, because you have to be building the business in the year to eventually deliver a final outcome. But we still have three quarters. And Q2 is an important one, but Q3 and Q4 are also very important.\nArsenije Matovic: Got it. Thanks for that. And on DGM, you mentioned strength in perpetual license. Also, I think last year, because it was still bundled, you mentioned there would have been $16.9 million in DGM ACV in fiscal 2023 Q1. When I'm thinking about kind of the strength in the perpetual license this quarter, could you provide color into how strong DGM ACV was this quarter, assuming that there was probably some perpetual SMS tailwind, given that strength of perpetual license? Thank you. \nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, I mean, normally, we don't like to disclose outcomes in quarters because quarter performance can be given by many reasons. We had a solid quarter in some areas of DGM, and we're tracking in other areas. We still believe that we'll meet or exceed our number for the fiscal year for DGM, and that's what we're focused on. But the business continues to be very successful. And as I said, from my interactions with customers, I think this is a business that as we expand globally through headcount and engagement with customers, engagement with our own historical customers in HAT, this is going to be very exciting and interesting.\nArsenije Matovic: Thank you, Antonio.\nAntonio Pietri: Yep, you\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Mark Schappel with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Mark.\nMark Schappel: Hi Antonio, hi Chantelle. Antonio, I want to turn to your chemical business. I wonder if you could just talk or speak to the parts of the overall chemical market that you're seeing and the most pressure, like say, bulk chemicals, ag chemicals, specialty chemicals. And then also maybe if you could also address what you're hearing from your chemical customers with respect to the potential likelihood of their businesses snapping back next year?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, I do think if you listen to the earnings calls from chemical customers over the last couple of weeks, two, three weeks, there's a little bit of a more positive narrative from these customers. If I think back over the last 12 months, there's no doubt that Aspen Chem [ph] remain sort of a positive area for chemical customers, bulk chemicals, less so. And that's where I think a lot of the herd was, depending on the region. It was destocking or demand. In Europe, it had to do with cost and the implications of the Russia-Ukraine war and so on. Now what we're starting to see and hear from customers is improving demand, sort of the \u2013 the green shoots of improving demand around bulk chemicals. I think spec chem has continued to remain solid. And they've also differentiated between their commitment and ability to again sustain their CapEx investments even through this down cycle because that's a longer-term investment versus OpEx. And that's what we benefit from. So I know that's been a question for investors between Emerson and AspenTech. I believe Emerson benefits tremendously from CapEx. We benefit from OpEx. Now we're here in budgeting season and I'm not so sure that the outlook for these chemical companies will change dramatically. Therefore, their budgets might be equally subdued for next calendar year, their next fiscal year. But we'll see. But clearly, there's -- you're starting to hear a little bit of more positive remarks around their macro demand environment than we've heard over the last six, nine months.\nMark Schappel: That's helpful. Thank you. And then Chantelle, real quick. Last quarter, I think it was noted that there were a few customers, particularly in Latin America and Asia that were just taking a little bit longer to pay. And I was just wondering if it's fair to assume, based on the good cash flow print this quarter, whether that trend has kind of corrected itself this quarter?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. I think that we've seen the amount we expected to see in Q1. If you remember, I said it would kind of come in over a few quarters, and the Q1 met what we expected from the Q4 from those countries that paid late. So I think it was absolutely in line, and we're definitely pleased with our Q1 free cash flow performance.\nMark Schappel: Thank you. Great.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Nay Soe Naing with Berenberg. Your line is open. \nNay Soe Naing: Hi both, hi thank you for taking the questions. I've got two, if I may. If I could start with the strategic investments that you mentioned, please. I was wondering if you could share a bit more color on which parts of the business that you're investing into? And also the high-velocity sales force, are there any particular opportunities that the sales organization is pursuing? And then my second question is on the divisional or segmental performance of the business. I think if I heard you correctly, I think you mentioned the engineering was -- had a really strong quarter, up about 13% year-on-year, so wondering if I could get some high-level segmental update for the rest of the business, please. Thank you. \nAntonio Pietri: Go ahead Chantelle, do you want to lever?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. I just didn't want it. So I think from an investment perspective, we're pleased with a few very specific areas of investment. The first one you mentioned is the high velocity sales, and there, as we ramp that headcount through the year, we're very much seeing those kind of new logos that we mentioned, some of the start-ups, new ventures, which are very exciting for us as new growth. And the land and expand opportunities for some of the other plays that we're seeing, so definitely high velocity sales for those two factors. The other investment area that we continue to ever since Q4 is the DGM business, mostly rest of world with an intent on Europe. So we're pleased on the sense of the investments we've made for sales going into Europe and the team that's been built out there and continues to work with closed pipelines. And then the third investment that's related to sales is setting up the services ecosystem for DGM. And so that's related to sales, to delivering the sales, and those are the three specific ones. And we're pleased with the growth we can get with those things being enabled. I think from a segment perspective, if I understood your question correctly, so we commented that this quarter was the highest growth for engineering over the last 13, not specifically given the amount that you quoted. But generally, the concept there is we're very pleased with the engineering growth. We don't usually disclose segments on a quarterly basis, but Antonio, maybe you could provide some anecdotal commentary?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, I mean, look, I'll just stay at a high level. But certainly, significant increasing headcount is going into DGM, both field sales as we expand internationally into Europe. But we're also adding some head count in other parts as well, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia. Aftermarket sales, which in a way, it's mostly an inside sales organization as well for DGM. We're making a significant investment in that area. Look, we're increasing the number of enterprise sales consultants for HAT because we believe there's a bigger opportunity that will start flowing through for HAT as a result of also sustainability and the combination of sustainability use cases with our traditional technology. And then a material increase in the overall number of headcount in the company. And it takes a while to make all these people productive, but that's also something that we focused on, the sales enablement and how do we accelerate that. And as a matter of fact, I'll also say that we've learned from Emerson since they have a much bigger sales organization, how they've scaled sales enablement. And that's sort of a best practice that we've been able to take from our relationship with Emerson. So I'm very encouraged, and it's an exciting time in AspenTech at the moment.\nNay Soe Naing: Understood. Thank you very much both. \nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you. \nOperator: I show no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Antonio for closing remarks.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, operator. Look, I'd like to highlight here to close. Again, we believe in our ability to deliver on our guidance for the year, our ability to grow double-digit ACV growth and at least 11.5%. We're very encouraged by the macro indicators in \u2013 across most of our industries. And as I said, chemicals looks like it's improving the macro demand for bulk chemical producers. So that's good. As I travel around the world to talk to DGM customers or SSE customers, I just marvel at how now relevant Aspen technologies is for global electrification and the role we are playing, and we will be increasingly playing in that area. I think sustainability is real. Certainly, some regions of the world are making bigger investments at this moment than others. But overall, the sustainability CapEx is starting to flow. And eventually, there will be OpEx with that, which will benefit our business, our MSC, APM suites. And then overall, look, very confident. There's a lot of work happening here. Now it's about execution and expansion. And then focusing in the remaining time that we have in the fiscal year to exceed your expectations. So with that, I want to thank you all, and look forward to talking at some point in the future.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

            "name": "Chantelle Breithaupt",
            "content": "Thank you for the kind words, Antonio. It has been a privilege to serve as CFO for the past two and a half years at AspenTech. I am highly appreciative of your leadership, vision and commitment to the company. I am proud of what we have accomplished and I'm very confident in AspenTech's ability to continue delivering strong top and bottom line growth going forward. I remain committed to working with Antonio, Chris and the entire team to ensure a successful transition. Turning to our Q1 performance, I'd like to start out by highlighting that our earnings presentation includes explanations regarding the impact of ASC Topic 606 on our financial results. We have also included definitions of Annual Contract Value or ACV, bookings and free cash flow among other metrics in our earnings presentation now available on our IR website. We ask that investors refer to these definitions together with today's call. Starting on Slide 9, annual contract value was $898 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, up 10.9% year-over-year and 1.4% quarter-over-quarter. As a reminder, Q1 typically sees the lowest number of transactions closed given our historical sales cadence. In addition, ACV performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 included one-time transformation and integration benefits from SSE and our acquisition of Inmation, which together represented approximately $10 million of net new ACV or 1.3 points of sequential growth in Q1 of fiscal 2023. Total bookings were $212 million in the first quarter, decreasing 5.4% year-over-year. As a reminder, bookings are impacted by the timing of renewals, which were down year-over-year, consistent with expectations. We expect $131 million in bookings up for renewal in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue was $249 million for the first quarter, which was approximately flat on a year-over-year basis. Please note that revenue in our model is heavily impacted by contract renewal timing and variability under ASC topic 606. Now turning to profitability, on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the impact of stock based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and acquisition and integration planning related fees, we reported operating income of $78 million in Q1 representing a 31% non-GAAP operating margin compared to a non-GAAP operating income of $93 million for a 37% non-GAAP operating margin a year ago. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period-to-period due to the timing of customer renewals and the resulting impact on license revenue recognition in a given quarter. Additionally, on expenses, please note that the increase was driven by increased headcount and compensation costs in line with Antonio's commentary around our expansion initiatives in fiscal 2024. This increase in expenses was expected and is consistent with our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Non-GAAP net income was $75 million in the quarter or $1.16 per share compared to non-GAAP net income of $142 million or $2.20 per share a year ago. Please note that the difference in non-GAAP net income between periods was mainly due to a lower benefit from income taxes in the first quarter compared to a year ago, driven by the change in our approach to computing our tax provision which originally occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $121 million of cash and cash equivalents, reflecting the impact of share repurchase under our $300 million share repurchase program. In addition, we had $198 million available on our revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 580,000 shares for $114 million under our $300 million share repurchase authorization announced in fiscal year 2024. We also settled our $100 million accelerated share repurchase program in the quarter to receive an additional 107,000 shares. Please note that the $100 million ASR program was paid for in full in fiscal 2023. For cash flow, we generated $17 million of cash from operations and $16 million of free cash flow in the quarter compared to $5 million in cash from operations and $4 million in free cash flow a year ago. As Antonio noted, this was in line with our expectations as Q1 has historically been our lowest cash flow quarter due to the amount of cash available for collection in the period. Turning to Slide 10, I would now like to close with guidance. For the full year of fiscal 2024 we are reiterating our outlook across all metrics. This includes at least 11.5% of ACV growth and a free cash flow target of at least $360 million for the period. We continue to expect total bookings of at least $1.04 billion with $580 million of bookings up for renewal in fiscal 2024. Our non-GAAP EPS range has increased by $0.06 [ph] from our prior guide to reflect the impact of our share repurchase activity in the first quarter on shares outstanding. There is no impact to GAAP EPS. For a complete overview of our fiscal 2024 guidance, please refer to our earnings press release and presentation available on our IR website. As investors think about linearity for the remainder of the year, we continue to expect a cadence consistent with our historical performance. This includes fiscal 2023 when adjusting for the one-time contributions from SSE Inmation in Q1 that I discussed earlier. We expect to generate net new ACV in the low 60% range in the second half of fiscal 2024. In addition, we expect that we will begin to see the impact from our sales investments in the second half of fiscal 2024 consistent with the assumptions we provided around our fiscal year 2024 guidance on our last quarterly earnings call. Please refer to Slide 13 of our earnings presentation for a detailed overview of our linearity expectations. To wrap up, we delivered a solid start to fiscal year 2024. We remain on track to meet our full year targets while also strategically investing in different areas that are supportive of our long-term growth objectives. We believe AspenTech is in a great position to benefit from many of the largest and most important investment trends impacting asset intensive industries today, which should support our ability to generate attractive levels of growth and profitability for the foreseeable future. With that, I will turn it back over to Antonio for closing comments. Hi, Matt. Yes. I think the only thing I would add Antonio to your point is yes, definitely in specifics Matt, such as the high velocity sales that Antonio referred to, those are specific measures and that a more macro level for us, the engineering suites where we look first and then that eventually falls into MSC as we build out land-and-expand. And our engineering suite saw the strongest growth it has out of 13 quarters. Last quarter we said engineering was the strongest out of 12. This is even stronger and up 13. So that's where we see it at a macro sweet level. And then Antonio had some specifics there that that kind of bolster it together. Yes, we're still committed to M&A in the sense of it's still a part of what we're looking for and focused on. I think that we have everything from tuck-in to larger pieces from that perspective Matt. We've remain committed to pursuing them as primary use of our capital and I think that we're waiting to see, we can't always time the market but we have, we definitely have a list of things from tuck-ins to larger that we're looking at. So it's still a good part of our capital allocation strategy. Yes. And I think that the other -- one other thing I would add too is that from a model perspective, Rob, we're seeing, we're pleased with the initial kind of conversations on tokenization. So you mentioned perp to term, and then SSE is now doing term to token, and we're pleased with how that tokenization conversations are going. That's the only thing I would add as well as far as progressing the transformation agenda. Yes. I think to the point I've add any additional color, when you take the current -- the Q1 period year-over-year, if you look at -- if you remove the onetime benefits of the SSE commercial transformation and Inmation, we actually had a 1% growth in Q1 last year versus the 1.4%. So if you look at organic growth, it's actually expansion of 1% to 1.4%, which I think is really critical from a run the business operational perspective and we're pleased with that underlying growth. If you look at the remainder of the year, there are several things we're confident in, and I'm sure Antonio will add some color. But everything from the SSE terminals in Q3, the sales productivity ramping that we talked about, the investment in Q4 last year, Q1 this year. The benefit of the DGM pipeline growing in the sense of both the pipeline term and aftermarket sales and then traditionally HAT has had stronger linearity in the second half. So we see quite a few factors. And Antonio, if you want to add any color to those five things? Yes. I think that we've seen the amount we expected to see in Q1. If you remember, I said it would kind of come in over a few quarters, and the Q1 met what we expected from the Q4 from those countries that paid late. So I think it was absolutely in line, and we're definitely pleased with our Q1 free cash flow performance. Thank you. Yes. I just didn't want it. So I think from an investment perspective, we're pleased with a few very specific areas of investment. The first one you mentioned is the high velocity sales, and there, as we ramp that headcount through the year, we're very much seeing those kind of new logos that we mentioned, some of the start-ups, new ventures, which are very exciting for us as new growth. And the land and expand opportunities for some of the other plays that we're seeing, so definitely high velocity sales for those two factors. The other investment area that we continue to ever since Q4 is the DGM business, mostly rest of world with an intent on Europe. So we're pleased on the sense of the investments we've made for sales going into Europe and the team that's been built out there and continues to work with closed pipelines. And then the third investment that's related to sales is setting up the services ecosystem for DGM. And so that's related to sales, to delivering the sales, and those are the three specific ones. And we're pleased with the growth we can get with those things being enabled. I think from a segment perspective, if I understood your question correctly, so we commented that this quarter was the highest growth for engineering over the last 13, not specifically given the amount that you quoted. But generally, the concept there is we're very pleased with the engineering growth. We don't usually disclose segments on a quarterly basis, but Antonio, maybe you could provide some anecdotal commentary? Thank you."

            "name": "Antonio Pietri",
            "content": "Thanks, Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Beginning on Slide 3, these are the four key takeaways for today's call. First, Q1 was a solid quarter, which once again delivered double digit ACV growth. We have hit the ground running to start the new fiscal year, shifting our focus from integration and transformation to execution and expansion. Second, demand remains strong in most end markets. More than ever, our products and solutions are mission critical and uniquely positioned to help customers meet their profitability and sustainability objectives. Third, we continue to see promising signs of growth across many different sustainability pathways that are expanding our market opportunity. We are highly encouraged about the potential to help new and existing customers achieve their sustainability objectives through partnership, collaboration and co-innovation in different use cases. And fourth, we remain confident in our ability to deliver against our guidance targets for the full fiscal year. Our ability to generate double digit ACV growth and expand free cash flow margins while also making strategic investments for growth is a great example of the scalability of our business model. Looking at our quarterly results in more detail, Annual Contract Value or ACV was $898 million, increasing 10.9% year-over-year and free cash flow was $16 million. As I stated last quarter, our cash flow is generally lowest in Q1 due to the seasonality of cash collections in our business. Turning to Slide 4, I will now provide an update on the dynamics we're seeing in our end markets, where demand remains strong excluding chemicals. In upstream and midstream energy, customers are experiencing favorable market conditions and healthy demand growth with recent acquisition announcements by U.S. oil majors demonstrating their confidence in the industry's long-term prospects. Strong demand combined with a persistently tight supply environment has led to higher oil prices and increased upstream CapEx investments, especially from national oil companies. CapEx investment is not only targeted at increasing oil supply, but also at sustaining existing production rates as the depletion rate of oil fields is a major area of focus. With the addition of the SEC suite, we can now offer an even more compelling lifecycle solution to manage and optimize the entire value chain. And we expect demand in these markets to remain positive for AspenTech going forward. In refining, while margins have fluctuated over the last three months, they remain strong as industry players benefit from a combination of increasing demand for fuels and capacity rationalization in Europe and North America. These same owner-operators remain focused on extending asset lifespans and reducing emissions through CapEx and OpEx investments, targeting improvements in operational efficiencies where digitalization plays a fundamental role. We remain well positioned to support refiners with their initiatives through our ability to drive higher efficiency and therefore improve sustainability. E&C customers are benefiting from positive CapEx trends in both traditional energy and energy transition projects driving higher pipeline and industry optimism. As we have mentioned in the past we believe that sustainability initiatives will ultimately support faster and less cyclical growth than we have seen historically in this end market. We're encouraged by the trends we see with the with the E&C customers and expect they will continue. The environment for chemicals remains consistent with the first half of this calendar year as industry players manage operating costs to support margins in response to weaker demand. While this is impacting our growth in the chemicals market, chemicals customers remain interested in AspenTech solutions to help drive efficiencies, reduce emissions and plastic waste and accelerate the development of the circular economy. This gives us confidence that we will deliver faster growth from this vertical as market conditions improve. Finally, demand in the power T&D industry remains robust as the industry benefits from an immense and ongoing investment cycle to expand, modernize and strengthen the grid. This is being driven by increasing consumer and industrial demand for electricity, rapid adoption of renewables and significant government funding. For example, the International Energy Agencies or IEA's most recent update to its net zero road map for 2050 predict that $680 billion in global annual grid investment is needed by 2030 to meet the expected increase in electricity demand. The IEA also predicted that nearly 70% of this investment will be used for distribution grids with the aim of expanding and strengthening and digitalizing networks, all of which were well prepared to help support through our DGM suite. We're bullish on the long-term growth potential of this market and it remains a key strategic area for investment going forward. Turning to Slide 5, I'd like to provide an update on our sales efforts as we kicked off the year. As I highlighted on Slide 3, we're making investments to increase sales capacity in both new and existing markets. We believe this investment combined with our Emerson commercial relationship will enable us to capitalize on the numerous growth opportunities we see across our business in the years ahead. We began this process in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and have made significant progress in these efforts since then. We expect to start benefiting from this additional capacity towards the end of fiscal 2024 and realize its full impact in fiscal 2025 and beyond. I'd now like to provide some additional color around software transactions closed in the quarter. Our customers continue to recognize the exceptional value and breadth of our innovation for their businesses, both to meet their needs today and their long-term development objectives. As a result, we have continued to win new business while also deepening our relationships with existing customers. The first customer reference is a world leader in industrial gases that is in the process of expanding from its traditional role in the production of industrial gases to become a leader in the production of green hydrogen. As part of this journey, this customer is using our software to design next generation process technology and estimate investment cost for green hydrogen, green ammonia and renewables. This customer doubled their engineering suite token entitlement as foundational technology for their ambitious growth objectives with plans to explore further standardization on our offerings going forward. The second customer is a leading refiner that decided to more than double their business with us citing its condition and the capabilities of our engineering suite and intention to explore additional use cases in alternative fuel development. This latest transaction built on our long-standing relationship with the customer and we're excited to continue partnering with them going forward. Third, for DGM we secured a large scale perpetual license transaction with a U.S. power utility. The utility was in search of a better way to manage its transmission network and recognizing the strength of our monarch platform chose us over the incumbent following a competitive process. This customer is interested in additional DGM Suite products and we plan to continue working with them to expand the relationship going forward. The fourth and final reference is from our collaboration with Emerson where we displaced an incumbent in the pulp and paper business of a leading global manufacturer. Emerson's existing relationship with this customer through its DeltaV install base provided valuable insights into its evaluation process and helped us identify that the value of our adaptive process control technology for more efficient and sustainable plant operations would be a key differentiator. We see room for expansion across this customer's asset base and remain confident in our ability to continue partnering with Emerson in pursuits going forward. Moving to Slide 6, I would like to provide an update on the sustainability opportunities we're seeing. The global mega trends of the energy transition and net zero targets continue to drive significant investment into the development of existing and novel technologies that can scale to achieve customers net zero ambitions. As a result, customers interest in our solution to support this type of sustainability projects is growing. This is manifested through ongoing CapEx spend, which drives increased interest and use in our engineering suite and represents most of our growth in this market today. These assets are still in their initial design phase. However, overtime we expect to see a benefit from sustainability related projects in our manufacture and supply chain and asset performance management suites as well, since we provide customer value across the entire asset life cycle from the basic design phase to asset operation and maintenance. The customer reference mentioned a moment ago around green hydrogen is an excellent example of these land-and-expand opportunities and we continue to see many other compelling projects in different areas of sustainability. We also won in the quarter several sustainability related opportunities through our high velocity sales team. These wins included companies still in their initial startup journeys and later stage companies that have advanced into the testing and development stages of a specific sustainability use cases. By leveraging our technology, these companies are developing solutions in areas such as carbon capture, plastics recycling, green hydrogen, renewable fuels and batteries. We're excited about the potential to help them scale up their digitalization initiatives going forward. Turning to Slide 7, I will now provide an update on our innovation initiatives. In Q1, we continued to drive innovation across our portfolio to help customers run their assets safer, greener, longer and faster, resulting in the planned release of enhancements to our current V14 software and a new V14.2 update later this month. These upgrades will include new machine learning and newer net capabilities across many of our products to enhance their hybrid modeling functionality. Expansion of our sustainability application library and product integration for Emerson Ovation power generation control system among other areas. We also remain focused on helping our partners reach their sustainability goals through co-innovation in the quarter. For example, we have completed the productization of the technology license from Aramco, Architect 3 to be released as Aspen's strategic planning for sustainability pathways. This product holds significant potential to help our customers make more informed decisions in their carbon management strategies and over time, it should also incorporate capabilities to help customers better navigate multiple other sustainability pathways. In its initial release the product will simultaneously consider economics, process design and operating constraints to help customers optimize their carbon management strategies. Additionally, as announced this afternoon, we're expanding our relationship with OMV Group, a multinational, integrated energy company based in Austria to accelerate the company's energy transition initiatives. As a first step in this partnership, we will focus on the renewable fuel optimization strategy by helping them better leverage their industrial data and develop a simplified integrated supply chain model across OMV's fuels and chemical supply chain. Now turning to Slide 8, I will discuss our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We remain confident in our ability to deliver ACV growth of at least 11.5% and free cash flow of at least $360 million. Industry demand for greater operational efficiency coupled with higher investment levels to support sustainability goals and energy transition initiatives is driving strong demand for our innovation. Macro trends remain consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year and we're closely monitoring the ongoing conflict in the Middle East for any potential impact on market dynamics which so far has been minimal. I would also like to give an update on the AspenTech team in Israel. Our priority has been the physical and mental safety of our team members there. We remain focused on these and we will continue to make sure we're doing all that we can to support our affected employees. We also want to extend our heartfelt condolences to all those directly and indirectly impacted by this event in Israel and throughout the region. Lastly, as announced a few weeks ago, Chantelle will be stepping down from her role here as CFO at the end of December. Chantelle has been a great partner to me and a leader for the organization. On behalf of the entire team here at AspenTech, I'd like to thank her for her many contributions and wish here all the best in the next chapter of her career. We have full confidence in Chris Stagno, SVP and Chief Accounting Officer to step into the interim CFO role after Chantelle's departure should we need additional time to complete our search for a permanent CFO. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Chantelle for a discussion of our Q1 financial results. Chantelle? Thank you, Chantelle. Q1 was a solid quarter where we once again delivered double digit ACV growth. Following our initial foundation building year, we have shifted focus to execution and expansion in fiscal year 2024. We're investing in areas that can drive our growth while also managing our expenses for a return to best-in-class profitability overtime. We're pleased to report that demand remains resilient for our mission critical solutions across most end markets. We also continue to see encouraging signs of growth in different areas of sustainability as I have touched on today. Our team is clearly energized to continue helping our customers with their sustainability initiatives going forward and we remain confident in our fiscal year 2024 guidance targets. With that, we will open it up for Q&A. Operator? Hi, Matt. Yes, Matt. Let me address that and then Chantelle can add her thoughts as well. So we have an initiative internally to certainly first of all size the opportunity, the total addressable market that we believe will come to us from sustainability, CapEx investments and eventually OpEx as well as these plans are built, our manufacturing supply chain and APM solutions will play a role in all of that. Now in in the near-term what we're seeing is opportunities in sustainability and different use cases flowing through our inside sales organization, our high velocity sales organization and the benefit that we're seeing is from CapEx investments and the initial front end engineering design for those assets. We're also seeing a little bit of MSC opportunities for customers that already have facilities that that that are running. Our advanced control technology again seems to be a target for some of these customers. But in general we do have a sense today for the amount of business that sustainability is generating and this is the reason for the investments that we're targeting in our high velocity sales organization which are specifically to really position us better to capture that opportunity in that market and eventually over the -- throughout the broader market that we have. Go ahead Chantelle. Thanks. Hi, Rob. Yes, let me take that. So look, the way the year flowed last year with SSE, certainly an important transformation benefit in the Q1 fiscal 2023 quarter as we cleaned up distances and we aligned the recognition of the spend in those contracts to our ACV policy. A lot of the renewals happened in the Q3 fiscal 2023 quarter. So we expect the Q3 fiscal 2024 quarter to be a big quarter for SSE and a quarter where we've been -- we hope to see the results from our focus on growing and expanding the SSE business. Of course, the growth is what will have an impact on ACV, but we're also targeting to expand the term length, which would have a benefit on the revenue side of the equation. But look, we're excited about SSE, especially with national oil companies we're seeing a lot of investment, CapEx investment flowing for oil and gas. And it's not only, as I said on the call, it's not only to increase production, but to replace a production that is naturally lost as oilfields deplete. And then is the use of SSE around carbon capture sequestration, also geothermal energies, we are engaged with a couple of customers as well starting the possibility using SSE to also store hydrogen in the subsurface as a storage resource. So we're optimistic about SSE and the potential that we see. But all the work that we're doing right now, we expect to see it in the Q3 and Q4 quarters as we focus on most of the renewals that we have for SSE. Yes. Look, on Russia, as you said, last quarter, we announced that we're going to move to a renewals-only business, and that is the case. And we're working renewals, some renewals already happened in Q1 and will continue to happen. And look, we also continue to monitor sanctions there just to make sure that we comply with any requirements from the U.S. government. On China, look, China is interesting in that our business continues to grow in China. Certainly, the Chinese government is driving an emphasis on local sourcing for technologies, meaning by local companies, Chinese companies. But we also see Chinese customers continue to buy our technology, which I believe speaks to the innovation and differentiation that still exists between what we do and our products and any native locally developed capabilities in the country there. So... Yes. Yes, sure. I mean, look, let me first say that a lot of work and a lot of goodness happened in fiscal 2023. We -- what I would say is, we synchronized the two organizations on what was possible, considering the trajectories of the two companies in their own markets. We now in fiscal 2024 expect to start seeing some of that benefit, and the reference that you mentioned is an example. What excites me and excites all of us is the huge installed base of systems that Emerson has in the market, not only in our core market, but in other markets, as you saw. That was a pulp and paper reference, which is typically not a market that AspenTech pursuits. So a huge installed base of DeltaV systems, huge installed base of Asian systems in power. Huge installed base of maintenance systems, Emerson maintenance technology capabilities that we believe are also opportunities for our asset performance management solution and especially the Mtell solution. The AspenTech organization now has access to all that installed base. It's engaged with the Emerson sales organization and the different account teams. And from a standpoint of estimating the opportunity, you need to look at the Emerson installed base and then you would have to determine what is the possibility there for AspenTech. But we also know that customers are very excited about what's possible between AspenTech and Emerson. And this is something that we'll be talking about during our global conference coming up at the end of April next year. So more to come, but it's about their installed base and then how AspenTech can be accelerated into that installed base. Yes. Look, the fact is that we -- we exceeded our expectations for the quarter around perpetual licenses for DGM. That continues to be a play for us. This is a transition that will happen over many years. Some customers are more willing to go to term than others. But what I want to emphasize is that certainly, a perpetual license contributes to revenue, contributes to upfront free cash flow, but it also generates GACV from the maintenance support that is in those agreements. And that's normally somewhere around 19% of the licenses, the perpetual licenses. So while, of course, eventually, we will prefer to have all that business be term, there is an important benefit from perpetual licenses that is reflected in the growth expectations for DGM in the year. But look, our pipeline is supporting both perpetual licenses and term. What I'll say about term, it's a new licensing model for customers. There's \u2013 like it happened with HAT, it was the beginning in 2009, 14 years ago. Customers have to get familiar with the model, have to get familiar with the terms and conditions. And therefore, that aspect of the negotiations takes a little longer. We saw good business in the quarter, and we have good engagement around term deals as well. So look, this is a transition that will happen over many years, but good benefits overall. Yes. We find EPCs to be very bullish about the -- how sustainability CapEx is flowing to them. And therefore, it's driving more use of tokens. One of the customer references that we talked about, while that customer is not an EPC, they've made a very strategic decision to focus on growing green hydrogen. And they doubled their entitlement with AspenTech. This is a seven-figure doubling of entitlement. So that benefit is absolutely now flowing through our growth, and we expect it to continue to be more and more so going forward. Hi, Jason. Okay. Go ahead, Chantelle and I'll help you. Yes. I mean, Chantelle is right. Look -- we're excited. I'm very excited about what's happening here. Of course, there's a lot of foundation building and now expansion because, in a way, AspenTech accelerated from $700 million to $1.1 billion in revenue and the related ACV overnight. So now it's expansion. If you look at Q1, as Chantelle said, look, in Q1 2023, there were benefits from transformation of SSE, significant benefits and then the Inmation inorganic benefit. On an apples-to-apples basis, it's a 40% improvement in the performance in the Q1 quarter versus last year. But look, what excites me is, okay, we're starting to see the flow of sustainability benefit through our high velocity sales organization. But if you go to Europe, for example, our installed base of customers there are incredibly focused on sustainability. Today, we announced that press release related to our partnership with OMV in Austria and where they're doing around biofuels and synthetic fuels, but \u2013 but you also have many other customers working on this type of use cases. So they will believe also \u2013 there will be an important benefit to have, not only in engineering, but MSC as well, and I believe also in APM. SSE, significant sustainability benefits. If you look at DGM and as I travel around the world, and I have over the last 18 months, talking to DGM customers, the opportunity is incredible. Look, we manage our technology, manages the largest transportation grid in Latin America. We -- our technology is responsible for managing the entire gas distribution network of Spain. The entire India grid is managed by the Monarch technology, the entire India grid. This is the largest synchronous electrical network in the world in one country. And the opportunity in India, as I meet with customers and the successes that we've had over the last 12 months in Europe around transportation, but also distribution, the 40%-plus market share that we have for DGM in North America as well. And we're only getting started outside of North America. We're doubling our sales organization in the field outside of North America to pursue opportunities, and that will continue to happen in future years as well. And the expansion of HVS [ph] is about sustainability. So as we look at all the macro indicators, the quality of the technology that we have and the opportunity and the CapEx that are starting to flow around global electrification and sustainability is very exciting. So the point that Chantelle made, look, this is a year is 12 months and four quarters. We just completed our first quarter, and now we're excited about Q2, Q3 and Q4. Yes. Yes. No, look, it will -- it is showing up in the pipeline and it will be down the road because the conversation started to happen really in the last six months to nine months around microgrids. I had a meeting with a customer in India last week that has been a customer of HAT for 30 years. And when they found out that our capabilities around microgrids, but more -- I think more importantly, the fact that we are now -- our technology is responsible for maintaining the India electrical grid imbalance. And in operations, I mean, our technology keeps the lights on in India. It was very exciting for that customer also the fact that we actually managed to transmit the distribution of electricity in some of the major cities in India. And therefore, that gives credence gives credibility to them, the capabilities that we can bring to bear around their own microgrids and their own utilities as they start incorporating renewables, as they start generating power from renewables because this customer is making a huge investment in solar power as well, even though there historically been chemical -- so petrochemical company. So this is also going to be an opportunity. But again, customers are only starting to learn about all of these, and those opportunities will be in the pipeline down the road. Yes, you're welcome. Hi Josh. All right. Well, look, I think Chantelle reiterated some of the reasons why we think not only Q2 and by the way, yes, I know we talked about the linearity of the year and what it means for Q2, but there's also Q3 and Q4 here. Look, I think more immediately, it is starting to see the impact from the hiring, the incremental headcount that we've been putting into sales since the beginning of Q4. We made also significant progress in that area in Q1. And then our pipeline of business, this is something that is -- our pipeline is continuing to grow across all three sort of historical businesses, HAT, OSI and SSE. And then okay, Q3, we've talked about the SEC renewals and in general. But look, historically, Q2 is the end of a fiscal year for most of our customers in HAT, also customers in SSE, DGM. Frankly, we haven't seen any seasonality to DGM because of the way those opportunities flow, mostly RFPs in the initial projects and then aftermarket sales and by the way, something that I want to say about the DGM business. The sales cycle for new customers in DGM is very long. We talked about it, 12, 24 months. But there's a business, once you're installed, that is much more accelerated. The name of that sales team inside AspenTech is aftermarket. I'm sure we'll change that name at some point. But that business is a shorter sales cycle business, is add-on once you're installed is adding new applications or new capabilities to what's already installed. And that's an area we're significantly increasing headcount. Sales cycle there, it can even be three months, but more normally six to 12 months. So this is an area where we see the opportunity to accelerate growth because of the cyclicality and then the focus on the incremental headcount that we're seeing there. And we expect to see some of that benefit in Q2 as well. But I don't \u2013 linearity is important, of course, because you have to be building the business in the year to eventually deliver a final outcome. But we still have three quarters. And Q2 is an important one, but Q3 and Q4 are also very important. Yes. Look, I mean, normally, we don't like to disclose outcomes in quarters because quarter performance can be given by many reasons. We had a solid quarter in some areas of DGM, and we're tracking in other areas. We still believe that we'll meet or exceed our number for the fiscal year for DGM, and that's what we're focused on. But the business continues to be very successful. And as I said, from my interactions with customers, I think this is a business that as we expand globally through headcount and engagement with customers, engagement with our own historical customers in HAT, this is going to be very exciting and interesting. Yep, you're welcome. Hi, Mark. Yes. Look, I do think if you listen to the earnings calls from chemical customers over the last couple of weeks, two, three weeks, there's a little bit of a more positive narrative from these customers. If I think back over the last 12 months, there's no doubt that Aspen Chem [ph] remain sort of a positive area for chemical customers, bulk chemicals, less so. And that's where I think a lot of the herd was, depending on the region. It was destocking or demand. In Europe, it had to do with cost and the implications of the Russia-Ukraine war and so on. Now what we're starting to see and hear from customers is improving demand, sort of the \u2013 the green shoots of improving demand around bulk chemicals. I think spec chem has continued to remain solid. And they've also differentiated between their commitment and ability to again sustain their CapEx investments even through this down cycle because that's a longer-term investment versus OpEx. And that's what we benefit from. So I know that's been a question for investors between Emerson and AspenTech. I believe Emerson benefits tremendously from CapEx. We benefit from OpEx. Now we're here in budgeting season and I'm not so sure that the outlook for these chemical companies will change dramatically. Therefore, their budgets might be equally subdued for next calendar year, their next fiscal year. But we'll see. But clearly, there's -- you're starting to hear a little bit of more positive remarks around their macro demand environment than we've heard over the last six, nine months. Go ahead Chantelle, do you want to lever? Yes. Well, I mean, look, I'll just stay at a high level. But certainly, significant increasing headcount is going into DGM, both field sales as we expand internationally into Europe. But we're also adding some head count in other parts as well, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia. Aftermarket sales, which in a way, it's mostly an inside sales organization as well for DGM. We're making a significant investment in that area. Look, we're increasing the number of enterprise sales consultants for HAT because we believe there's a bigger opportunity that will start flowing through for HAT as a result of also sustainability and the combination of sustainability use cases with our traditional technology. And then a material increase in the overall number of headcount in the company. And it takes a while to make all these people productive, but that's also something that we focused on, the sales enablement and how do we accelerate that. And as a matter of fact, I'll also say that we've learned from Emerson since they have a much bigger sales organization, how they've scaled sales enablement. And that's sort of a best practice that we've been able to take from our relationship with Emerson. So I'm very encouraged, and it's an exciting time in AspenTech at the moment. Thank you, operator. Look, I'd like to highlight here to close. Again, we believe in our ability to deliver on our guidance for the year, our ability to grow double-digit ACV growth and at least 11.5%. We're very encouraged by the macro indicators in \u2013 across most of our industries. And as I said, chemicals looks like it's improving the macro demand for bulk chemical producers. So that's good. As I travel around the world to talk to DGM customers or SSE customers, I just marvel at how now relevant Aspen technologies is for global electrification and the role we are playing, and we will be increasingly playing in that area. I think sustainability is real. Certainly, some regions of the world are making bigger investments at this moment than others. But overall, the sustainability CapEx is starting to flow. And eventually, there will be OpEx with that, which will benefit our business, our MSC, APM suites. And then overall, look, very confident. There's a lot of work happening here. Now it's about execution and expansion. And then focusing in the remaining time that we have in the fiscal year to exceed your expectations. So with that, I want to thank you all, and look forward to talking at some point in the future."
