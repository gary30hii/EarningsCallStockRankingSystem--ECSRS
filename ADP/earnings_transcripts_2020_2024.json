At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanyal Hussain: Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining ADP\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call and webcast. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. The earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompany today\u2019s call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segment. During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures, can be found in our earnings release. Today\u2019s call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions. And with that, let me now turn the call over to Carlos.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you, Dany and thank you everyone for joining the call. This morning, we reported our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results. Although we ended the year \u2013 this year against significant headwinds related to COVID-19, we believe we executed well over the course of the last 12 months. And our product offerings remain well positioned to support sustainable long-term revenue growth as we continue to help companies and their workforces through all types of environments. For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $3.4 billion, down 3% reported and 2% organic constant currency, which was better than our expectations. And for the full year, we delivered revenue of $14.6 billion, up 3% reported and 4% organic constant currency. Our adjusted EBIT margin increased 10 basis points in the quarter and increased 60 basis points for the full year, well ahead of our expectations as we managed our expense base prudently to absorb the impact of a decline in revenue in the fourth quarter, while simultaneously providing an elevated level of service to our clients. With this revenue and margin performance, our adjusted EPS growth was flat for the quarter and up 9% for the year. Considering the unprecedented and evolving macroeconomic situation, we are very pleased with our execution in the quarter and our current positioning as employment continues to gradually recover from the steep declines our clients have experienced. The global health crisis from COVID-19 has clearly evolved over these past few months. And I will start today\u2019s discussion by providing a brief update on the trends we have experienced. When we reported our fiscal third quarter results in April, we were just starting to see some preliminary signs of stabilization after weeks of rapid deterioration, more specifically, across our own data sources, including weekly payroll, clock-in volume, job postings and background screenings. There were multiple indications that we were reaching the trough. Now 3 months later, we do believe we saw conditions bottom in late April. Whereas our pays per control was trending down mid-teens in April, it has since improved to be down about 10% as we exited the quarter. And for the full quarter, pays per control was down 10.8% better than we had contemplated in our outlook. Last quarter, we also discussed our expectation for elevated out-of-business losses in May and June. Those losses ultimately developed in line with our expectations. This yielded a decline in our retention rate of 20 basis points to 90.5% for the full year. Though if not for the elevated out-of-business losses in Q4, we believe our retention rate would have been up for the year. In fact, despite these losses in Q4 for fiscal 2020, we tied an all-time high retention for our mid-market and hitting multi-year high in our up-market. Looking ahead, what we have been encouraged by signs that the economic distress brought about by COVID-19 has started to ease in certain countries and several U.S. states. We are seeing continued or even increasing distress in others. And over the past several weeks, we have seen the pace of employment recovery slow. Accordingly, as we set our expectations for the coming year, we believe that the worst is behind us. But the global economic recovery over the coming quarters will be gradual. Kathleen will discuss some of our specific macroeconomic assumptions in more detail. I\u2019d like to turn now to Employer Services new business bookings. We reported a decline of 21% for the year, which was in line with our revised outlook despite the limited visibility we had in making that forecast. And although this represents a significant decline, the actual execution by our sales force was better than what this reported growth rate suggests. As we mentioned last quarter, there are two components to our bookings figure. Our gross bookings we actually sold in the quarter and adjustments for previously required bookings. Our gross bookings sold in Q4, while down significantly, came in ahead of our forecast, and most importantly, exited the quarter with improving momentum. This gives us confidence that buying behavior is continuing to trend in the right direction, which we believe will drive further bookings recovery in the coming quarters. Furthermore, our sales force has continued to adapt to this virtual sales environment as we have invested in training, stayed agile on sales messaging, and continued to foster our channel relationships. We are also continuing to see week-on-week improvement in leading indicators, such as referrals, appointments per salesperson and demos scheduled. In addition to these gross bookings, we regularly adjust bookings we have previously recognized if for example, a client is no longer expected to start within the original estimated timeframe or starting with fewer employees than originally anticipated. These backlog adjustments are ordinarily immaterial to our bookings growth. But as we said last quarter, COVID-19 is causing some clients to delay implementations or to start with fewer employees than we originally signed. We made a larger backlog adjustment in Q4 than previously planned. And this offset the better underlying sales performance we experienced. Looking ahead, we expect we will likely see negative bookings growth in the first half of fiscal 2021 as we are still selling into an unfavorable macro environment. We expect growth to be flat to positive in Q3 with much more substantial growth in Q4 driving full year bookings growth of flat to up 10%. Beyond fiscal 2021, a key priority will be getting our sales productivity back to or above its previous level. Within our control are the investments we make. And in fiscal 2021, we are planning to continue investing in product innovation, digital sales capabilities and leading-edge sales tools to drive sales productivity higher. In addition, at this point, we are planning to add modestly to the size of our sales force. And together, we believe these investments will position us well to return to our previous \u2013 to our prior new business bookings growth trend line as client buying behavior continues to normalize. Factors beyond our control, including overall GDP trends, as well as the timing and scope of workers returning to their job sites, were in the meantime likely continue to impact our bookings. Moving on, service has remained critical to our clients. Our clients look to us for support and guidance in navigating through the complexities of key HR challenges and regulatory change. And our goal has been to serve as a trusted partner as they faced COVID-19. Our clients have responded very positively to the robust service we have provided. And that in turn has led to record NPS scores in June as a direct outcome of our commitment to providing a successful level of service. And we expect this favorable NPS trend to have positive implications for us in the years ahead. In response to the initial surge in service volumes related to COVID-19, we redeployed hundreds of sales and implementation associates to help meet the service need. While average resolution time spent per service requests remains elevated as our clients work through complex issues, we have now seen our service request volume return to more normal levels. And we are happy to report that we have now deployed most of these associates back to their sales and implementation rules. We continue to keep watch on proposed legislation that could drive another surge in client service demand and we remain prepared for such a scenario. We also continue to serve our clients through product innovation. During the quarter, we rolled out a range of solutions to help our clients through the crisis and prepare for the recovery. We implemented over 1,000 feature changes in response to 2,000 legislative updates in 60 countries. And we also had over 400,000 clients run over 2 million Paycheck Protection Program reports for a total loan volume of approximately $115 billion. Many of those clients have also now run the necessary reports to apply for their loans to be forgiven. Looking ahead, a key product focus is enabling safe return to the workplace. And we are offering tools, including touchless and voice-enabled clocking, health attestation and enhanced scheduling and analytics to help clients manage their workforces as they resume workplace operations. We continually progress on our other major product initiatives, including the rollout of our next-gen HCM platform and payroll engines. 2 weeks ago, we won yet another award for our next-gen HCM solution, the Ventana Annual Digital Innovation award. And we remain excited about its rollout. Perhaps more importantly, despite shifting our workforce to remote environment, we remain on track to hit our R&D development roadmap milestones. And just this quarter, we piloted next-gen HCM and payroll in Australia. Our product team also launched our new workforce management solution in the down-market, like a new time kiosk in the Apple App Store. And we went general availability with Wisely Direct in our mid-market and down-market. Now, taking a step back, I\u2019d like to say that in every challenge, there is a potential for upside and COVID-19 is no exception. We believe that the nature of this shock in which businesses of all sizes have faced major uncertainties in managing their employees, have made an HCM partnership they have with ADP got much more valuable. And as companies emerge from this crisis, we expect them to see even more clearly the benefits of investing in robust, secure HCM offerings that include expertise and service to support their mission-critical activities. So, although COVID-19 has created temporary headwinds in our growth, past experience has taught us to stand firm regarding our investments in strategy as part of our commitment to drive long-term sustainable growth. The strength of our business model and balance sheet allow us to do exactly that. And we are well-positioned in our product, service and go-to-market strategy. Last, before turning it over to Kathleen, I would like to quickly touch on our plans for our own associates. Last quarter, we discussed having over 98% of our workforce operating virtually, including our sales force and we have been pleased with that transition and their overall performance in this environment. While we are well-positioned to continue operating this way, we are in the early stages of bringing back a small portion of our workforce to the office on a volunteer-only basis. And I am actually pleased to join you today from our Roseland headquarters, which we opened just this Monday. Our sales force will continue to primarily engage with prospects and clients virtually, but they are beginning to conduct face-to-face meetings in some geographies, to the extent that they and our clients and prospects are ready to do so. And with all that said, I would like to once again take a moment to recognize our associates for their outstanding effort and the sacrifices they have made. I understand the monumental task of managing work and home life is a complex situation. And I also know it\u2019s not easy. A heartfelt thanks to our associates and leaders for their commitment. I will now turn it over to Kathleen.\nKathleen Winters: Thank you, Carlos and good morning everyone. During the quarter, our revenues declined as we felt the full brunt of a double-digit decline in employment among our clients combined with other recession-driven headwinds. But we believe we executed well and are well-positioned to do so for the quarters ahead. For the fourth quarter, our revenue decline of 3% reported and 2% organic constant currency was ahead of our expectations as pays per control and PEO performance were better than we have planned. Our adjusted EBIT margin was up 10 basis points in the quarter also well ahead of our expectations. We took certain costs actions in the quarter continue to benefit from cost savings related to our ongoing transformation initiatives and also benefited from lower selling expenses, which together offset the margin impact from the loss of high margin revenues related to COVID-19. Our adjusted effective tax rate decreased 210 basis points to 22.9% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. And our adjusted diluted earnings per share was flat at $1.14 as lower year-over-year revenues were offset by modest margin expansion, a lower tax rate and a lower share count compared to a year ago. We ended fiscal 2020 with revenue growth of 3% reported and 4% organic constant currency. Adjusted EBIT margins up 60 basis points and adjusted EPS growth of 9%, all in a solid year, particularly given the significant decline in economic activity and employment that we faced over the last few months. As I move on to ES segment results, it\u2019s important to emphasize how resilient the business performance was in the context of unprecedented headwinds, including a 10.8% decline in pays per control and a 22% drop in client funds interest revenue. During the quarter, our Employer Services revenue declined 6% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic constant currency basis in line with our expectations as better underlying growth was offset by incremental FX drag. Our client fund balance declined 8% in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower pays per control, lower state unemployment insurance rates, payroll tax deferrals amongst some of our clients, and the continued lapping of the closure of our Netherlands money movement operation in October of 2019. Combining that balance decline with a 30 basis point decline in average yields drove our client funds revenue to decline by 22% to $115 million. For the full year, our ES revenue was up 1% reported and 2% organic constant currency, a solid performance. Employer Services margins were flat for the quarter, well ahead as our most recent expectations. We had the impact of lower revenues at relatively high incremental margins as we discussed last quarter offset by prudent cost control measures across all categories. ES margins were up 60 basis points for the full year. Moving on to PEO, also solid performance given the circumstances. Our total PEO segment revenues increased nearly 4% for the quarter to $1.1 billion and average worksite employees declined 3% to $548,000. This revenue and worksite employee growth, were both ahead of our expectations driven by better retention performance and pass-through revenue. Same-store employment at our PEO clients performed in line with our expectations of a mid single-digit decline and as expected was more resilient than the average client in our ES segment. Revenues, excluding zero margin benefits pass-throughs, declined 5%. And in addition to being driven by lower worksite employees, it continued to include pressure from lower workers\u2019 compensation and SUI costs and related pricing. PEO margin declined 450 basis points in the quarter. This included about 530 basis points of unfavorability from the net expense in ADP indemnity of approximately $34 million, which contrasts to the $22 million benefit we had in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. As a reminder, we had experienced favorable worker\u2019s comp claim trends over the past several years which translated to favorable reserve adjustments in ADP indemnity. Those trends remain positive, but not as much as what we factor in our most recent reinsurance agreements. And as a result, we had a slight true-up the other way this year. Let me turn now to our outlook for fiscal 2021. I will start by discussing some of the specific U.S. macro driven assumptions that underpin our guidance. The data for these assumptions is a combination of our own trend data and third-party macroeconomic forecast and we believe we are utilizing a balanced outlook. First, our pays per control outlook. We are assuming a decline in average pays per control of 3% to 4% for the year, driven by decline in the high single-digit range for the first half of the year, improving to a decline of mid single-digit by Q3, followed by a rebound to positive mid to high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. This outlook corresponds to a gradual improvement in the employment picture through the fiscal year though it did not contemplate a full employment recovery. To help translate this trend into a single number you can anchor to, our guidance contemplates the U.S. getting to approximately 7% unemployment by June of 2021. Second, out-of-business losses. Our retention was negatively impacted by losses in its most recent quarter, as we had a number of clients turn inactive, but after monitoring and assessing, we decided to write-off as losses. While we believe government stimulus programs have helped many small businesses, we continue to see some companies in an inactive state where they are not paying employees. And we expect continued elevated losses in the early part of fiscal 2021 as restrictions and lower demand in certain industries continue to drive fall out. As a result, we are setting our expectation for ES retention to decline by another 50 to 100 basis points over this coming fiscal year. Lastly, on client fund interest. As discussed last quarter, our client balance growth is being impacted by the combination of a decline in pays per control, lower new business bookings and out-of-business losses and we had some modest pressure from companies taking advantage of the payroll tax deferral provision of the CARES Act. We are assuming a client funds balance of 6% to 8% for the year. And like pays per control, we expect it to be negative for the first three quarters and then return to growth in Q4. We expect our average yield to decline as well. As a reminder in Q4, we temporarily suspended our purchases of new securities and reinvestment of maturing securities in our client funds portfolio. And earlier this month, we resumed reinvesting. We have over $5 billion in securities maturing in fiscal 2021, yielding on average over 2% and we expect to reinvest them at prevailing yields that are well below that level. As a result, we expect our average client funds yield to be down 50 basis points to 1.6% for the year. With this combination of lower balance and yields, we expect interest income on client funds to be $390 million to $400 million, down about $150 million versus fiscal 2020 and we expect interest income from our extended investment strategy to be $430 million to $440 million, down about $125 million versus fiscal 2020. With that said, without the benefit of our client investment strategy, which utilizes laddered maturities, we believe the headwind to fiscal 2020 would have been even greater. Having covered the major macro topics for fiscal 2021 let me share with you how we are deploying our downturn playbook to manage expenses. We have concentrated on areas where we have excess capacity and on reducing discretionary costs, while maintaining investment in sales, products and our associates. And as we emphasized last quarter, we continue to have the strong cash flow profile and balance sheet strength to withstand impacts to our revenue without taking immediate actions on our investments. We said we would be thoughtful and strategic in assessing the most prudent path forward, a path that balances positioning for recovery against near-term margin performance. We have now had a quarter to assess our business capacity and needs. And during the fourth quarter, we identified businesses across ADP, where unfortunately, we didn\u2019t believe a recovery was likely in the near-term and therefore had excess capacity in service and implementation. In addition to taking specific headcount actions, we have further tightened on non-essential spend, including T&E and other discretionary spend. We are also continuing to move forward with our transformation initiatives. For the past few years, we have highlighted for you some of the discrete material initiatives that we have worked on and their estimated level of benefits. In fiscal 2019, we executed on our voluntary early retirement program, which yielded over $150 million in annual run-rate benefits. In fiscal 2020, we executed on our workforce optimization program and a procurement initiative, which together yielded approximately $150 million in annual run-rate savings against our original expectations of $100 million. For fiscal 2021, we have two important initiatives to call out. First, we are moving forward with a digital transformation initiative that leverages many of the capabilities we highlighted at our February 2020 Innovation Day, primarily to optimize our implementation and service in addition to enhancing efficiency in other parts of the organization. As examples, we are further utilizing automation in the implementation process, deploying additional self-service features throughout our platform, broadening the use of guided assist tools and expanding the use of chat and chatbot. We expect this to be a multi-year effort as we work to optimize large parts of our service delivery model. Our innovation agenda is running full speed ahead and that includes innovation in our client engagement. We also expanded our procurement transformation initiative and expect further benefit for fiscal 2021. We have reassessed our real estate footprint and although we had already closed over 70 subscale locations as part of our service alignment initiative in recent years. We recently closed several additional locations, including a large office in New Jersey. We will continue to evaluate whether there was further opportunity for location consolidation. Between these two initiatives, our digital transformation initiative and the expansion of our procurement initiative we expect to realize a combined $125 million in savings during fiscal 2021, with over a $150 million in run-rate savings exiting the year. Let\u2019s now turn to our outlook for fiscal 2021. We will start with the ES segment. We expect a decline of 3% to 5% in revenue for the full year driven by our outlook for a decline in pays per control, balance and yield pressure in our client funds interest portfolio as well as pressure from new business bookings and elevated out-of-business losses. Compared to what we just experienced in the fourth quarter, we expect the first half of fiscal 2021 to experience a slightly greater revenue decline as the incremental impact from lower sales out-of-business losses and lower client funds interest more than offset the gradual recovery in pays per control that we are anticipating. We expect revenue growth to improve modestly in Q3 and then turn positive in Q4. We expect our margin in the Employer Services segment to be down about 300 basis points for the year. And as a reminder, the revenues we lose from pays per control, out-of-business losses, and client funds interest are all high margin. As with revenue, we are expecting a decline in ES margin during the first three quarters and an increase in the fourth quarter. For our PEO, we expect revenue down 2% to up 2% for the full year with average worksite employee count flat to down 3% driven by similar factors as our ES segment, namely headwinds and same-store employment, out-of-business losses and bookings pressure. We expect average worksite employee growth to be negative during the first three quarters and turn positive in Q4. Our revenues, excluding zero margin pass-throughs, are expected to be down 1% to 4% and we continue to expect lower workers\u2019 compensation and SUI pricing. For PEO margin, we expect to be down about 100 basis points in fiscal 2021 driven in part by drag from higher zero margin pass-through revenues partially offset by a favorable compare for ADP Indemnity. With these segment outlooks, we now anticipate total ADP revenue to decline 1% to 4% in fiscal 2021 and we anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to be down about 300 basis points as the benefits from our continued expense management and transformation initiatives are partially offsetting the detrimental impact \u2013 margin impact of expected lost revenue due to COVID-19 as well as the investments we continue to make. We anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 23.1%. This rate includes less than 10 basis points of estimated excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation related to restricted stock vesting in Q1 of fiscal \u201821. But it does not include any estimated tax benefit related to potential stock option exercises given the dependency of that benefit on the timing of those exercises. Last quarter, we temporarily suspended our share repurchases as we decided it would be prudent to wait for stabilization of the overall environment. At this point, we anticipate resuming our share repurchase program at some point this fiscal year subject to market conditions and we have a slight net share count reduction contemplated in our guidance. And as a result of our outlook for lower revenue and margins and higher tax offset partially by lower share count, we currently expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to decline 13% to 18% in fiscal 2021. As most of you are aware, we also have $1 billion in notes due September of this year. At this point, we expect to issue new debt in the coming weeks or months depending on market conditions. I would like to conclude by saying that although COVID-19 is putting pressure on our financial performance, we believe this is transitory and the long-term prospects for ADP are no way diminished and may even be enhanced by the current environment. For fiscal 2021, we are remaining focused on opportunities for innovation and growth while taking a deliberate balanced approach to managing expenses and we are confident in our long-term growth prospects. I look forward to updating you on our progress. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. One key one is just from a bookings perspective as you look out over the coming year and you gave us a bit of a sense for the cadence that you expect \u2013 which of the new solutions do you expect to see the greatest traction from? Which ones are you the most excited about and which ones could be the most incremental from a really long-term perspective?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, I think from an incremental standpoint \u2013 to start off with the last part of the question from a long-term standpoint, I think some of the investments we have made in some of our next-gen solutions, I think for me has to be one of the most optimistic in terms of potentially moving the needle from an incrementality standpoint right, because we already have a very large, as you know, bookings number and anything that we can add on top of that goes into the top of the funnel in terms of revenue growth. And that\u2019s really was the reason for these investments is to really move the needle competitively and to improve our position from a differentiation standpoint. And so the early signs of course now somewhat temporarily interrupted by COVID-19 were positive in terms of the traction we are getting both with our next-gen HCM platform as well as with our next-gen payroll platform. So that\u2019s kind of where I feel the most optimistic in terms of the long-term. In terms of kind of the cadence and more kind of the short to medium-term in terms of next year \u2013 really the fourth quarter is an important part as we have kind of been alluding to here in our prepared comments and some of that is really clearly the pace of the recovery. So, there is \u2013 we have an expectation, which I think is in line with generally accepted I think forecast, if you will. And you heard kind of as a proxy, the expectation that unemployment reach a certain stage by the end of the fiscal year end, those things are all proxies for GDP growth and you guys all have plenty of access to your own firms\u2019 economic forecast and so forth. So, the second half is really the key for us from a bookings standpoint. And there aside from the incrementality question, this issue that we have around for example, adjusting to our \u2013 adjustments to our gross bookings is an important one, because to the extent that the recovery continues on the pace we expect, it would help us a lot if we would be \u2013 if we can start and continue to implement clients that were previously sold and that \u2013 so clearly one positive would be that, that doesn\u2019t degrade any further, because in full transparency, we mentioned that in our prepared statements that\u2019s a concern under this kind of environment, but there is potential upside as well there. So there is downside and there is upside there as well. But when you see the incredible decrease in activity in just a couple of months following the beginning of the crisis, it takes a while for that \u2013 those buckets to get filled up again in terms of leads, then turning into first deployments, then turning into presentations to clients. So, that whole process of how the sales evolution goes is critical for us in the second half. And the places that were hurt the most, which in our case and some of it is perhaps just because of the nature of the crisis that the down-market was hit very, very hard in terms of pays per control and also just declines in activity, but also came back, frankly surprisingly \u2013 you can\u2019t call it strong because it is still down year-over-year, but I think the bookings performance in the down market has been I think gratifying. And so if we continue on that trend, that would be good news for the second half of the year. And then we expect based on the current trends that the mid-market and the up market will then kind of follow suit as the kind of pipeline leading indicators that we mentioned translate into actual bookings and actual sales. So I guess, the short story is the things that were the hardest hit are the things that \u2013 in the initial stages are the things that should have, in our opinion, the biggest rebound in the second half. And then on top of that obviously, our new product investments I think are a source of optimism for us. We\u2019ve also invested in I think you heard us mention Workforce Management in the down market. I mean, we have a lot of things going on. You can see it in our investments in technology over the last four to five years and obviously some of those things are longer-term like the next-gen stuff. Some of it has been we have been investment phase for 6 to 12 months and we expect those things to translate now into new sales. So I don\u2019t know if you heard our tone over the last several years, we pivoted to investing more in product and particularly more around Agile technology and that hopefully gives us some firepower here in terms of our bookings incrementality going into this year, but also into the following years as well.\nMark Marcon: Great.\nKathleen Winters: Mark, yes, just to add a little bit more there in terms of by each segment for sure we are expecting sales growth across each of the segments in fiscal \u201821. And as Carlos said, down market seems to be resilient and has trended up since we were at the low point several weeks ago but down market has been trending up earlier. And then during the latter part of the year, we would expect up markets and international for that matter to continue along those lines, but for sure expecting sales growth across all segments. And to Carlos\u2019 point, from a long-term incremental perspective, certainly expecting Next-Gen HCM to be a driver there, but our strategic platforms in the near-term RUN and Workforce Now have been performing really well in the market and we expect them to continue to perform really well in the market as we recover through this.\nMark Marcon: Great. Just as a follow-up, could you just give us an update in terms of where we stand in terms of the number of implementations on next-gen HCM or sometimes known as Lifion and also next-gen payroll this percentage of the client base has been converted?\nCarlos Rodriguez: So on next-gen HCM, you could probably appreciate for two, three months, that wasn\u2019t really something that a lot of companies were focused on and for that matter us [indiscernible] unfortunate. But the good news is we did actually start a client just a week ago. So that is a ray of sunshine in what was otherwise a lot of dark clouds. So we had a number of clients that were set to be implemented in our fourth fiscal quarter, which delayed and one of those actually started here already in the early part of the first quarter. So that is encouraging but we are not that different from where we were before. So call it still a handful, I think we have like seven or eight clients live somewhere in that neighborhood on next-gen HCM. On next-gen payroll, there the target at the beginning from a piloting standpoint really was \u2013 clients are not quite the same size of next-gen HCM. So it\u2019s a slightly different dynamic and it\u2019s \u2013 and we\u2019re making, in terms of numbers of clients more progress, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the product necessarily is making more progress. It\u2019s just the difference between the markets we\u2019re serving. Next-gen HCM is really in the early stages aimed more at the mid-market, if you will, than really the up market even though we expect it to be our next-gen payroll engine across our mid-market and up market in the initial stages, it\u2019s really mid-market. So I think we have somewhere around 100 clients sold. And I think maybe that same number implemented, if I\u2019m not mistaken.\nKathleen Winters: That\u2019s right.\nCarlos Rodriguez: So we\u2019re making some good progress there. And there the pace is a little bit better in the sense that we didn\u2019t come to a complete stop on next-gen payroll and we continue to implement clients there and kind of move forward. But it\u2019s a \u2013 this is a very challenging situation for our clients and we really need to kind of help them get through this situation and the crisis not necessarily press them to get started as quickly as possible although that\u2019s obviously our desire from our standpoint.\nMark Marcon: Of course. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open. Please check if your line is on mute.\nRamsey El-Assal: Can you hear me now?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, we can hear. Yep, go ahead.\nDanyal Hussain: Yes, go ahead. We can hear you, if you?\nRamsey El-Assal: Hello, hello.\nOperator: Pardon me, sir. Please proceed with your question. And we will move on to our next question. Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Could you characterize the gross bookings performance in the June quarter prior to the backlog adjustment?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, I mean I think we \u2013 we\u2019re just trying to give a nod to our sales force in terms of \u2013 they were \u2013 they performed better than we clearly had forecasted and that we gave in terms of color, commentary during this same earnings call or during the earnings call of the last quarter, but they were still down significantly. So at the end of the day, we just want to make sure that you guys got the right impression that we weren\u2019t disappointed and that we didn\u2019t do worse than we expected. But from a mechanical number standpoint \u2013 think still down somewhere around 50% like if that\u2019s a fair characterization. I don\u2019t know if Kathleen has any more color there?\nKathleen Winters: Yes, no, the gross bookings were slightly positive to what we had expected. The approximately, down 50% is right, which is what we have been anticipating. And then the backlog adjustment, which actually is part of our normal process factored into the overall bookings number being down slightly more than that for the fourth quarter.\nDavid Togut: Got it. And just as my follow-up, assuming the employment recovery proceeds as you have laid out Kathleen negative 7% unemployment by the end of FY \u201821, would you expect to be back on your sort of normalized growth path by FY \u201822?\nKathleen Winters: Yes, go ahead Carlos.\nCarlos Rodriguez: No, go ahead, go ahead.\nKathleen Winters: It\u2019s a great question in terms of when do we return to previous levels of growth and profitability. And as you pointed out, a lot really depends on the shape of the recovery. And look, we have taken the best view we can and tried to share with you what we are thinking about that in terms of the shape of that recovery. But it really is going to depend on that. Last recession, it took a couple of years for sales and retention and revenue growth to return to the pre-recession levels. Now, is it going to look exactly like it looked last time? We don\u2019t know. This crisis is different. The make-up of ADP is different. So, I hate to say it, but it\u2019s going to depend on a lot of factors but returning to those previous growth rates certainly will not be in fiscal \u201821 based on what we see right now and we will update you as things change and as we go through the current year.\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think, maybe just add a little bit of \u2013 just in terms of my own observations from looking at the kind of the quarterly cadence, if you will and how \u2013 what the implications are for FY \u201822, it really depends on \u2013 are we thinking about sales? Are we thinking about revenue? Are we thinking about profit growth? And they are all kind of different buckets. But I guess and to Kathleen\u2019s point, it really all depends \u2013 if this is unlike the financial crisis, not a two or three, the financial crisis really was \u2013 you go back and think about it, the kind of mini crisis that occurred over the course of the following two or three years. Remember, we had the European debt crisis. We had a number of things that elongated that situation, but that could happen here as well, and we are of course not scientists and we don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going to happen. But we\u2019re using kind of the same forecast that I think all of you are using and if you make those assumptions around when the healthcare crisis passes, i.e., vaccines and therapeutics and so forth. If you follow that path then FY \u201822, when we exit in the fourth quarter of FY \u201821 \u2013 from a mathematical standpoint \u2013 I think you used the term growth rates, the growth rates are going to look pretty good in terms of as you exit from a booking standpoint and then starting maybe with profitability in the first quarter of FY \u201822 because in the fourth quarter of FY \u201821 we saw some NDE expense. But some of that \u2013 frankly is really the comparisons. So we have three quarters in FY \u201822 that are going to look pretty good. Because if we still think that the first couple of quarters of FY \u201821 are still impacted pretty significantly by COVID and by the first couple of quarters of FY \u201822 you don\u2019t have that impact you are going to have some I hope some really good tailwinds on some of these growth numbers. But the key for me was looking at absolute booking dollars in the fourth quarter of \u201821 compared to the fourth quarter of \u201819 because obviously \u201820 is not a good comparison and looking also at our absolute profitability in the fourth quarter of \u201821 and our revenue in the fourth quarter of \u201821. And again, I feel some sense of optimism about \u201822 based on those exit rate assumptions with a capital assumption because this is \u2013 we are a long way away from having certainty and you have seen how fluid the situation has been. But I think the math I think works kind of favorably once we get through fiscal year \u201821 and particularly when we get through the first three quarters of fiscal year \u201821.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Greatly appreciated.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks, good morning guys. Just wanted to start with kind of a high-level question on the fiscal \u201821 guide, I mean, we have got revenue down modestly, but obviously EPS down quite a bit and that\u2019s being driven by a little bit of tax, but really the 300 bps of EBIT margin decline. And I guess it looks like the transformation savings should largely offset the hit to float income. So, are we really just down to kind of isolating this against decremental margins that maybe people didn\u2019t appreciate the \u2013 kind of the severity of or are there other factors there? Because I just think at a high level people were surprised to see how much EPS is going to be down relative to revenue for the current fiscal year?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Let me take a crack at a couple of high level things. And then Kathleen probably can provide some additional maybe detail to help in terms of quantify some of the stuff. But we \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if it was clear from our comments last quarter or this quarter but having been through these types of \u2013 not through a healthcare crisis but I personally have been through dot com downturn, Y2K at ADP, 9/11 and the Global Financial Crisis. And our Board is a Board that is long-term oriented and it feels like despite how horrible the situation is, it feels like this situation is transitory and so one of the things that we have as a first principle is to maintain our level of investment. That doesn\u2019t mean that we are not prudent around our expenses and I think we have been and I think Kathleen gave you some examples of some of the things that that we are doing. But we are going to add to our sales head count next year, which might surprise some people and maybe not something that you were expecting. And the problem is that when you model only one fiscal year for a company like ADP or recurring revenue model, if you decrease your sales cost or even your investment in product and technology, it actually looks quite favorable. And you can probably offset quite a bit of revenue decline. The question is, is that really the right thing to do long-term? We don\u2019t believe that it is and so that\u2019s one factor, philosophically. The second factor is that even though we clearly have some decline in the number of clients, the nature of the revenues that are going down is very high margin. So you mentioned client funds interest, but we also have another decrease from a comparison standpoint \u201820 to \u201821 in pays per control, which is call it 100% margin as well. And there is very little work related to the number of worksite, I am sorry, the number of employees paid by our clients. Our work is \u2013 workload is generally driven by number of clients and then as we have all now observed in the last quarter also driven a lot by the regulatory environment. And so the amount of work has not decreased much and in some cases has increased on behalf of our clients. And again, that\u2019s a place where we could cut some of that support. And then it would lead to lower NPS scores and we probably would have retention go down, but the single most important driver of financial value for ADP is client retention and lifetime value. To lose clients and then have to go sell them again and implement them again makes absolutely no sense and all the experience we \u2013 that I have and we have and our Board has tells us to kind of stand firm and make sure that \u2013 that doesn\u2019t mean that we ignore the realities around us. If we thought that this was a permanent decrease in capacity of the economy or in terms of the global outlook, and then it was going to last two, three, four years, we probably would be behaving differently, but that\u2019s not our expectation, that\u2019s not our \u2013 that\u2019s not the way that we are managing the company. There\u2019s also a couple of other items I think that mathematically may be not helping us and maybe Kathleen can help a little bit with some of those sure.\nKathleen Winters: Yes. Look, on the surface the guide to 300 basis point decline on the surface may sound like a lot, but there\u2019s a lot going on in there. When you take it apart, I think it\u2019s really \u2013 and you put it into the kind of buckets, I think you will see how we arrived at that guidance and that expectation, right? As we\u2019ve talked about and as you know we\u2019ve got obviously a substantial impact from loss \u2013 a very high margin revenue, right? We\u2019ve got that high margin revenue. We\u2019ve got clients on interest, which is a hurt on margin year-over-year. We also have growth in zero margin pass-throughs, which falls right to the bottom line from a margin perspective. That\u2019s going to be a significant hurt for us where it hasn\u2019t been as much in the past. And the continued investment along the lines of \u2013 look, we think it\u2019s prudent and smart to take to continue our long-term view and to continue to invest in sales and in product. We are committed to that level of investment so that\u2019s a hurt. And then you do have, as you pointed out, the transformation and other cost actions that we\u2019ve been taking that only partially offset that. So I would think about it in those buckets in terms of, look, you\u2019ve got this high margin revenue. You\u2019ve got some other things that fall right to the bottom line like zero margin pass-throughs and client funds interest. You\u2019ve got the commitment to continuing to invest and quite frankly, I think we have been executing really well from a transformation perspective and also in terms of looking at \u2013 as we navigate through this period the excess capacity cost that we have and being really smart about addressing those.\nCarlos Rodriguez: But I guess let me \u2013 just to provide a little bit of color on kind of our view because I learned the hard way from my two predecessors about some of these things. So if you just look at the sales engine aspect of our business and you look at it over multiple years, you can actually do the math that if our \u2013 if we decreased our head count, call it 5% or even if we just kept it flat and you assume the productivity continued on kind of its normal trend, which is a big assumption, but if you even \u2013 if you assume that, you can see the impact that has on revenue growth from multiple years down the road. So obviously, if you expect that you\u2019re not going to be able to ever return to the same kind of sales productivity you had before, then you have to do something differently, but that\u2019s not the expectation we have right now. And it\u2019s critical to our growth in \u201822, \u201823, and \u201824 for us to maintain our investment in our sales engine. Not to mention in our product and our technology and a few other places as well.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Yes, that\u2019s really good color. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask just about retention. I know you are forecasting the 50 bps to 100 bps decline this year. I wanted to see if we can get a sense of how that compares to how you exited the June quarter on that metric? And I\u2019m really just trying to get a sense of whether you are forecasting acceleration in churn over the next few quarters or more of just kind of a stable and steady pace of churn?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Again, let me give you some maybe philosophical, high-level comments and then Kathleen, maybe can give you some color around the fourth quarter and some of the assumptions. So in general, we have been, and I\u2019ve been again, having been through multiple downturns and crises, I have been surprised by the resilience of our retention and we think there could be a number of factors here. One of them could be all of the government stimulus, the Paycheck Protection Program, all these things might \u2013 these are all new things compared to the past that might be helping. There is also the potential that some clients are frozen in place, if you will, like, we\u2019ve talked about how difficult our bookings have been. I think logic would tell me that that\u2019s probably happening across multiple industries and multiple competitors. And so we would be \u2013 actually dishonest not to assume that that might be helping our retention in some parts of our business like the mid-market and the up-market because in the down-market it\u2019s really driven more by out of business. So having said all that, I would say that a lot of these things are really about timing because if there continues to be government stimulus and there continues to be optimism about this being transitory, then I think this kind of holds. And you have probably some additional fallout in the downmarket as a result of out of business and so forth, but you don\u2019t have kind of a major downturn or a collapse in retention. And that\u2019s kind of where I am today that we are expecting what I would say is \u2013 I would consider these to be reasonable and modest declines in retention when you compare them to other downturns that we have some data on and some history about.\nKathleen Winters: Yes, and we did do a lot of work around and analysis around what happened in the last recession and what happened to retention by segment. And I think we have got a pretty balanced view if you look at the decline in retention that we experienced in Q4 and what we are guiding to and expecting and planning for in fiscal \u201821. It\u2019s basically in line with the retention pressure that we had during the last recession. So we will see. I mean, it\u2019s really hard to predict. And to tell what level of support the PPP program has had and is going to have, but that\u2019s our best view right now.\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think \u2013 I don\u2019t literally don\u2019t give it. But I think I feel like this is an environment where transparency is probably not a bad idea just to give you like \u2013 like, that\u2019s why we gave you kind of the gross bookings number besides the net bookings number because you guys need to model this stuff so you can understand what\u2019s happening here. But think the fourth quarter somewhere around couple of hundred basis point decline in retention, which I think again all things considered, I thought was, and most of that decline frankly came in the down-market. So, that to me feels like better than I would have expected 3 months before that.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Alright, well, we appreciate all the disclosure. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-tsin Huang: Hi, thanks so much for all this detail. Just on the transformation initiatives, I caught all the details there. How about looking beyond those two initiatives? Are there any other potential actions that you could take, anything that could be material over a similar size?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Again, I will maybe give some high-level comments and let, I think Kathleen give some additional detail. We have a very large menu of things that we can do. This company has a very, very long history of navigating through multiple changes in environments and multiple economic circumstances and now I think we will add to our repertoire managing through a major health crisis and a pandemic. And so, we have \u2013 I don\u2019t know how else to put it. We have a huge number of things that we could do, if necessary, and when necessary. This is an incredibly resilient business model. I recognize that this is unusual for ADP to be down the way we are, but it is what it is in terms of the economic circumstances around us. But believe me; we have a number of levers. So as I said, like some of these things are \u2013 and our business model are somewhat self-correcting. If in the unlikely event, there was a belief that there was a permanent impairment of kind of global economic GDP or growth vis-\u00e0-vis other industries or other companies, I think that we are in somewhat of a better place because the amount of money that we spend on NDE and on implementation alone would, at least for the short-term, would certainly enhance our bottom line and help us from a margin standpoint. That\u2019s not what we want because the real value to be created here is through growth \u2013 like, through profitable growth, not by kind of shrinking our way into profitability. But we have no intentions of allowing ourselves to underperform, if you will, on a long-term basis below what we have delivered for many, many decades. And that\u2019s what \u201821 is all about. But if circumstances change, we have a very long list and quite a lot of variable expense in our P&L and a very strong balance sheet and a very strong cash position.\nKathleen Winters: So, Tien-tsin, thank you for the question, it\u2019s a logical question because when you think about kind of the past and the history over the last several years, right, in terms of what we\u2019ve been driving from a transformation perspective, you can see that we have had these \u2013 several kind of big major initiatives over the last several years, right. We had Service Alignment Initiative first. We have a Voluntary Early Retirement program. We told you about the workforce optimization and then the procurement and now the procurement continues and we have shared with you our work that we have doing around digital transformation. The question, what comes next? Quite frankly, I think there is a lot of runway and we have a lot to do from a digital standpoint and also from a procurement standpoint. It does get harder as you go, I will say, but there is a lot to do there. And a lot of the digital projects, first of all, the digital is certainly focused on our service and implementation, because there is opportunity there, but it is across the entire company. So every single segment and every single department, whether you are front-office or your back-office is tasked with thinking about digital transformation, automation, how do you make the work more efficient, how do you take work out? There is runway there. So I expect that you will hear us talking about that for some time to come. The procurement, well, it does get harder as you go. What I would say is, in an environment like this that we are in right now, in a downturn, it does present some procurement opportunities that may be didn\u2019t exist a year ago \u2013 when you actually \u2013 when you go back and you are negotiating with vendors and suppliers and so forth. So we have got real work to do there. And as you heard us say in the prepared comments, we have expanded procurement to make sure we are capturing all the opportunities. From a real estate perspective in terms of, look, the environment has changed. The way the world is working has changed. Let\u2019s make sure we are thinking about our real estate footprint in a fresh modern, forward-looking way to ensure we are utilizing the assets that we have to the fullest extent possible. We are understanding how we are going to get work done in the future. We are understanding how we can utilize mobility models where it makes sense to do that. So we have got a lot of work and some really good work to do here from a digital procurement real estate perspective.\nCarlos Rodriguez: And just one last comment on that, the other thing that maybe is under-appreciated but it\u2019s worth mentioning here because again, we are typically not talking about these things as they are more longer-term, but if your question was really more about what\u2019s potentially next, longer-term and not just in \u201821, our next-gen investments are the largest potential digital transformation effort we have ever undergone. And we always focus on them around what they are going to do in terms of our winning in the marketplace and our sales growth and our revenue growth. But trust me when I tell you that the business cases for those investments and the progress we have been making over all these years, there\u2019s an enormous expectation for, call it automation, call it efficiency, whatever you want to call it and we don\u2019t usually talk about our tax engine, we talk about HCM and payroll. But one of those next-gen investments is our tax engine, which again there, the early signs \u2013 we already have a couple of hundred thousand clients migrated onto that platform. And when you see how quickly we are able to make these legislative changes in that platform and the cost structure and the cost of support again, I would be very optimistic that one of the largest transformation efforts we will be talking about in the future when we look backwards is these next-generation investments. I am hoping they are also going to lead to big growth incrementality and winning more market share in the marketplace, but do not underestimate the value of these investments in terms of our back-office and also our cost structure.\nTien-tsin Huang: Yes. No, thank you for that. That\u2019s very complete answer. If you don\u2019t mind, just one quick follow-up, you mentioned the legislative changes and a lot of the work and effort that you have put into that. And Carlos, I know I ask you this all the time. So I am going to ask you again, could we see more demand? I know you mentioned improved bookings momentum that you started to see, but could you see more demand for the service model in general here? I don\u2019t know where you are seeing maybe some switching from or more demand for work but again election year, lot of complexity, probably more changes coming. Could that help you here?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I mean, I don\u2019t see how it can\u2019t. So and usually, I am not that optimistic or that definitive because if it were only the election, I would say, we will have to wait and see. But I don\u2019t, again, I am not usually a pontificator, but I just don\u2019t see how companies after all this don\u2019t reassess not just kind of how they do HCM and payroll and so forth, but so many other parts of their business model where continuity and resiliency and so forth are critical and that applies to the smallest client to the very largest clients. I think that for a lot of us, I don\u2019t think we are the only ones or the only industry or space where that\u2019s going to be a tailwind but it\u2019s hard to believe that this in a positive. Now, in what quarter and how do I qualify that because you have GDP going down, I don\u2019t know, 30-something-percent in the second quarter. Even if people were thinking about that, that wasn\u2019t really going to be a factor certainly in the fourth quarter. The question is how does that net out in the math, right, because you want to somehow be able to parse that out and understand how much of is incremental. And I can\u2019t necessarily do that scientifically but intellectually, it\u2019s hard to believe that it is in a tailwind going forward for us. And then on the election side, we like \u2013 we generally like change because \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t matter whether one party versus the other. We are apolitical as a company. But usually when there\u2019s change there is change and for employers. Employers are an instrument of policy of the government, it\u2019s how public policy gets effectuated whether it\u2019s through tax or all the various safety policies and \u2013 you are seeing all these changes in leave policies now to help manage through the health crisis. So that\u2019s all incredible, I think opportunity for us to help our clients and when there is opportunity to help clients, that\u2019s opportunity to sell new business as well.\nTien-tsin Huang: Yes, agreed. Thank you. Have a safe rest of the summer. Thanks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you. You too.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to ask take another crack on the margin question and looking at it from this perspective. The fourth quarter margin in ES was impressive to bring it to flat and you took a lot of the brunt of the hit. Just thinking about that fourth quarter versus the guide of down 300 basis points, I guess I am a little surprised that it doesn\u2019t hold up better. Can you just contrast the margins in the fourth quarter being flat versus down 300 basis points from that perspective?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Sure. I mean, I think some of it is \u2013 Kathleen will go through some of the math but the client funds interest impact is much bigger I think going forward than it was in the fourth quarter because of the laddering that we do in our portfolio. The impact for example of bookings \u2013 we still had a lot of business starting because remember, there is a lag between bookings and starts. So I think you would all be very surprised by how much. Even though we had some delays in some \u2013 particularly for larger clients, we started a lot of business in the fourth quarter also and as kind of bookings decline now the starts and the amount of revenue that goes into the run rate declines as well as you move forward. And so you get that sales number back up again. So I think there are a number of just kind of mathematical realities that I think that hit us in the next two or three quarters in comparison the fourth quarter. But I think that, again, we are not going to do that, like, we are not going to provide quarterly guidance, but I would encourage you to attempt to do either a first half or a second half based on the tone that you are hearing from us or even attempt to do it by quarter because the view that we have of the fourth quarter, again assuming the assumptions are correct, I think paints a very different picture than the picture may be that you are getting by looking at a \u201821 number. I would also argue that when we talk about \u201821, its fiscal \u201821, which happens to be only 6 months of \u201821. For every other company out there when you talk about \u201821, you are talking about the beginning of January of \u201821 where everybody expects everything already to be back to normal and that is \u2013 in terms of assumption of things being back to normal. So it\u2019s a little bit maybe tricky in terms of the thought process and the math. But I don\u2019t know if Kathleen has anything to add on that?\nKathleen Winters: Yes, I mean, yes, it\u2019s a little bit hard to say, okay, compare one quarter to a full year particularly in a year like this when there is so much going on and there\u2019s so much linearity aspect in fiscal \u201821. But what I will say is in Q4 we did have sales expense, our NDE was actually a little bit of a help in Q4 versus it ends up being a surge so that\u2019s kind of one difference one to the other. And the other thing is, from a transformation perspective in terms of benefits and how the benefits flow, well, certainly being a favorable and a help for us in each year in fiscal \u201820 and in fiscal \u201821, in Q4 there is a pretty substantial impact favorability from transformation if you were to compare it to a full year fiscal \u201821. So it\u2019s kind of a math of how it all falls out in a quarter versus in a full year. But again, think about fiscal \u201820 as sorry, fiscal \u201821 as look, you have got this high margin revenue. You have got top line stuff that falls right to the bottom line being the zero margin pass-through and the client funds interest. You have got our continued commitment to investments. So you have got that from sales expense partially offset by continued transformation work.\nBryan Keane: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, the elevated out-of-business losses, just trying to get a sense of how that\u2019s compared in past recessions and then how much more do we have to go on that? I mean have you written down the majority of it and there\u2019s just a little bit left over because I know in fiscal year \u201821 you are saying there will be some more losses. So just trying to get an impact of magnitude of previous recessions and how much is left? Thanks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: So that really comes through in the retention. So it\u2019s not really, we don\u2019t quote, unquote, write it down, right? So that really comes through in terms of the losses from a retention standpoint. We have like maybe others some clients that have quote, unquote stopped processing and, but they are still there, and so there is a question of which of those clients come back and which of those clients don\u2019t come back. But we have modeled in the down-market, this is really a down-market issue. We hope that it\u2019s a down-market issue. At least in prior economic cycle that\u2019s been the case. And I think you see it reflected in our retention rate, but it\u2019s very, very hard for us to say with any level of certainty, how that\u2019s going to exactly play out in the future. We have looked at all the prior downturns, and we know that there\u2019s probably some out of business that\u2019s still there that\u2019s going to occur. And a lot of this is, in this case is going to depend on government stimulus and whether there continues to be some support for small business or not and also just the overall level of GDP and obviously the overall pace of recovery in terms of people going back to spending on products that help small businesses survive.\nBryan Keane: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good morning guys. I apologize. I am going to ask one more question on margins. Just a clarification on the backside because I think that may be the effect of the de-leveraging related to pays per control, I think a little bit steeper than we were expecting, etcetera. Is the implication of that that coming out of this as we get back to better employment levels late in \u201821 that you would see a sort of similar snapback, is that the way we should be thinking about it as unemployment improves? I mean, when we are looking out into FY \u201822 or are there reasons that we wouldn\u2019t expect that to happen? Thanks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: No, I think that\u2019s right. And again, hate to go back to, because I think I would encourage you like I am doing the focus on both growth rates, but also, because I know they are important in terms of models and so forth, but absolute numbers as well because if pays per control doesn\u2019t grow in the fourth quarter of fiscal year \u201822 we have a serious problem; like if there\u2019s not a big snapback of that number, like if there isn\u2019t a huge snapback of bookings, we have serious problems. And so the only thing that we think is not something that we want to model improving is interest rates because it just doesn\u2019t feel like is a basis for doing that, but I think if you take reasonable assumptions based on economic forecast, you do have a fairly significant snapback in terms of growth rates, if you will or improvement percentages. The question then is, what does that mean in terms of absolute numbers? And so if you still have 7% unemployment, by definition that unemployment rate is still higher than it was in the, call it third quarter of fiscal year \u201820 and that has some implications in terms of absolute level if you will, of pays per control and we have kind of modeled that in to our assumptions but for sure there\u2019s snapback in the numbers. There is no denying.\nLisa Ellis: Good. Okay, alright. And then just my follow-up is related to the PEO; as you are seeing because I know you don\u2019t \u2013 your bookings are yes, related bookings so just a kind of question on demand environment for the PEO. As you are seeing companies adjusting now to the crisis and to the recession how is demand acting for the PEO? Meaning is it positive, because companies are looking to variabilize cost or are you seeing some companies move away from the PEO because of reducing benefits? What does that demand outlook look like? Thank you.\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think the demand so far. Our experience in the PEO has been that it was kind of in line with the rest of the business. It looked a little more resilient in April, which you may have heard that tone from us but then May and June, pretty much in line with what was happening across, yes, In terms of bookings demand. And I think some of that is because of just the sales cycle. If you think about the PEO the sales cycle resembles more the up-market. The lower end of the up-market than it does the down-market, even though the average client size is small and that\u2019s because it\u2019s a high involvement product and high involvement sale because you are basically turning over all of your HCM including your benefits your workers\u2019 comp, etcetera. So, I think that\u2019s what we have seen in the short term. If you look at again 20, 25 years worth of history, I can\u2019t even believe I have been doing this for that long, but I started my career in the PEO and every time there is an economic cycle or a change, whether it\u2019s dot com or financial crisis, whenever there is a lot of theories. And I think the secular demand and growth of the PEO doesn\u2019t seem to be impacted by many things. So I would still expect that kind of solution to have a lot of legs for small and mid-size clients for a long time to come. In the interim, there could be ups and downs, because as you said if companies are quote unquote hunkering down and don\u2019t want to offer benefits \u2013 at least in our PEO part of the value proposition is benefits and so \u2013 but so far when you look at sales results, lead generation activity, etcetera, there is no reason to believe that the PEO won\u2019t recover in the same way that we expect the rest of the business to recover from a booking standpoint.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Wald from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSteven Wald: Great, thanks for taking my question. Could we just \u2013 coming at some of the implicit assumptions under the guidance another angle. Just curious what you guys thoughts are in terms of what you are seeing conditions on the ground wise in terms of geographic concentration. I mean certainly some parts of the country are more open than others, some industries are doing better than others, I guess, I am just curious if you guys could sort of separate out how you guys are thinking about that on the go-forward and the unevenness of the recovery and what that means for your client base? I know you have talked about being diversified, but certainly there is a quite disparate experience level across the country right now.\nCarlos Rodriguez: It\u2019s a great question. I think you probably saw in our comments that we said that we observed in our data that there has been a slowdown in the last few weeks, so we are looking at the data weekly and we do look at it geographically, both globally in terms of by country but also within the U.S. by state. And as you would expect part of the challenge in the last several weeks and months has been in the places where you have seen some of the comeback in terms of the virus. The resurgence of the virus in kind of the southern states and also Texas and California, but nothing back to kind of the full shutdown that we saw in April, which is in line with what you are all seeing as well in the news and so forth. This is more about leveling off of growth rather than kind of a decline. So we have seen it in the same metrics that I talked about in the last quarter. So, I can see it in like the number of job postings and screenings and so forth that have \u2013 that were on an upward trend line and frankly it was certainly not a V, but it was a nice upwardly sloped trend language then it was translating into improved employment both in our numbers, but also in the government reported numbers, but we have seen a plateauing of that as of the last 2 or 3 weeks. And so that\u2019s something that we \u2013 fortunately we re-looked at our assumptions for fiscal year \u201821 the assumptions we have for pays per control for the first quarter are around what the pays per control exit growth rate was for the fourth quarter and based on this kind of plateauing that feels like the right place for us to be. And the problem is we don\u2019t want to necessarily go tweak the second quarter, the third quarter and the fourth quarter, because as you have seen over the last 3 or 4 months, 3 or 4 months ago we were actually thinking about opening our office in Orlando \u2013 in Maitland, Orlando, because everything was fine in Florida and nothing was happening in Florida and we didn\u2019t know what the hell we were going to do in New Jersey and New York. And as we sit here today I am sitting in the office in New Jersey and we are not opening anything in Florida. So, I think it\u2019s unfortunately a very fluid situation and you just have to keep an eye on all of these assumptions both at the macro level, but as you said, we have very detailed information and a heat map by state. And I would say that what you are hearing and seeing in the news is what we are seeing in the data. But what that\u2019s translating into is a plateauing or a leveling off of employment short-term so far, not a decline.\nSteven Wald: That\u2019s very helpful. Maybe if I could just squeeze a quick follow-up in here. Carlos, I think you have laid out at your Innovation Day earlier this year that the addressable market ADP sits in, it\u2019s about $150 billion of revenue a year growing at 5% to 6%. Obviously, that\u2019s changed given COVID, but I am just curious to get any updated thoughts you have around maybe where that stands today? But if you can really speak to where it stands today given the fluidity of the situation, how we are thinking about it coming out of it given your comments and Kathleen\u2019s comments about the enhanced opportunity for the space you are in?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Listen there is a lot of smart analysts out there and industry analysts out there that would probably be better answering that question. And they probably are going to need a little bit more time and information to answer that question. But I will answer it the same way that I answered it earlier today, which is I don\u2019t know by how much, but it\u2019s hard to believe that past the transitory nature of the situation that, that growth rate for the industry isn\u2019t at least what it is if not higher because and again, I am not trying to be arrogant that, that is only for HCM, but there are other industries that I think have, shouldn\u2019t have tailwind from these events, where the acceleration of people to using cloud services and using what I would consider to be outsourced services so that you can focus on your core business, but also have resiliency. I think and also so that you can improve efficiency and you can improve productivity of your workforce and improve engagement of your workforce. All of those things I think are going to get tailwind and it\u2019s across multiple technology sectors that I think are going to probably benefit on a longer term on a medium term and longer term basis from this unfortunate situation.\nSteven Wald: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thanks. So just a couple of final thoughts. One is I know I said it before, but we have navigated through a lot of issues over many decades. I have had the experience of being through several myself, whether it\u2019s the dotcom recession, what happened after 9/11, the global financial crisis, because in that case, it was really a synchronized global downturn and now this health crisis. And the one thing that I would say about ADP\u2019s business model regardless of I know the focus here is on the short-term, but if you stay focused on the long-term, it\u2019s an incredibly resilient business model, financial model, but also business model. The value of our products and our services is key and one small anecdote, I think we may have mentioned it in the last call. But as kind of this crisis unfolded we had to become like many other parts of the economy, we had to go and talk to governors and leaders, including the White House to make sure that we were deemed an essential service, because we needed to stay in operation. And so I don\u2019t know what better sign there is of a resilient long-term model than to be considered an essential service, because we definitely \u2013 we definitely are. We are glad we were there to help our clients will still be there to help our clients. But I think that speaks volumes to the long-term viability and also upside of the business that we are a critical service an essential service to the economy and to our clients. We are proud of that. And I am proud of what our associates did to live up to that expectation. And as to the next year again, I would just encourage everyone to think through kind of first half second half or even by quarter because at least for me assuming that we stay on the trajectory that we are on, which I realize is fluid, but with those assumptions the fourth quarter exit rate of FY \u201821 is really what I am focused on and not necessarily the short-term results of the first few quarters of FY \u201821 although we are going to do our best to perform as well as we can throughout that as well. And lastly, I know Kathleen said in her comments, but we are very proud to have delivered $1.5 billion in cash back to the dividends and $1 billion through buybacks through, which I think is also another sign of the incredible resilience. And I think cash flow generation capability of this business model in this kind of short-term hit that we are having to revenues and to profitability, I don\u2019t believe will impair our ability to continue that tradition of returning cash to our shareholders. And for that, I want to say that I appreciate the patience of our shareholders as well and all of you. And I thank you today for listening to us and for all your questions. And I wish you all a very safe summer as well. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kathleen Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Carlos and good morning everyone. During the quarter, our revenues declined as we felt the full brunt of a double-digit decline in employment among our clients combined with other recession-driven headwinds. But we believe we executed well and are well-positioned to do so for the quarters ahead. For the fourth quarter, our revenue decline of 3% reported and 2% organic constant currency was ahead of our expectations as pays per control and PEO performance were better than we have planned. Our adjusted EBIT margin was up 10 basis points in the quarter also well ahead of our expectations. We took certain costs actions in the quarter continue to benefit from cost savings related to our ongoing transformation initiatives and also benefited from lower selling expenses, which together offset the margin impact from the loss of high margin revenues related to COVID-19. Our adjusted effective tax rate decreased 210 basis points to 22.9% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. And our adjusted diluted earnings per share was flat at $1.14 as lower year-over-year revenues were offset by modest margin expansion, a lower tax rate and a lower share count compared to a year ago. We ended fiscal 2020 with revenue growth of 3% reported and 4% organic constant currency. Adjusted EBIT margins up 60 basis points and adjusted EPS growth of 9%, all in a solid year, particularly given the significant decline in economic activity and employment that we faced over the last few months. As I move on to ES segment results, it\u2019s important to emphasize how resilient the business performance was in the context of unprecedented headwinds, including a 10.8% decline in pays per control and a 22% drop in client funds interest revenue. During the quarter, our Employer Services revenue declined 6% on a reported basis and 5% on an organic constant currency basis in line with our expectations as better underlying growth was offset by incremental FX drag. Our client fund balance declined 8% in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower pays per control, lower state unemployment insurance rates, payroll tax deferrals amongst some of our clients, and the continued lapping of the closure of our Netherlands money movement operation in October of 2019. Combining that balance decline with a 30 basis point decline in average yields drove our client funds revenue to decline by 22% to $115 million. For the full year, our ES revenue was up 1% reported and 2% organic constant currency, a solid performance. Employer Services margins were flat for the quarter, well ahead as our most recent expectations. We had the impact of lower revenues at relatively high incremental margins as we discussed last quarter offset by prudent cost control measures across all categories. ES margins were up 60 basis points for the full year. Moving on to PEO, also solid performance given the circumstances. Our total PEO segment revenues increased nearly 4% for the quarter to $1.1 billion and average worksite employees declined 3% to $548,000. This revenue and worksite employee growth, were both ahead of our expectations driven by better retention performance and pass-through revenue. Same-store employment at our PEO clients performed in line with our expectations of a mid single-digit decline and as expected was more resilient than the average client in our ES segment. Revenues, excluding zero margin benefits pass-throughs, declined 5%. And in addition to being driven by lower worksite employees, it continued to include pressure from lower workers\u2019 compensation and SUI costs and related pricing. PEO margin declined 450 basis points in the quarter. This included about 530 basis points of unfavorability from the net expense in ADP indemnity of approximately $34 million, which contrasts to the $22 million benefit we had in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. As a reminder, we had experienced favorable worker\u2019s comp claim trends over the past several years which translated to favorable reserve adjustments in ADP indemnity. Those trends remain positive, but not as much as what we factor in our most recent reinsurance agreements. And as a result, we had a slight true-up the other way this year. Let me turn now to our outlook for fiscal 2021. I will start by discussing some of the specific U.S. macro driven assumptions that underpin our guidance. The data for these assumptions is a combination of our own trend data and third-party macroeconomic forecast and we believe we are utilizing a balanced outlook. First, our pays per control outlook. We are assuming a decline in average pays per control of 3% to 4% for the year, driven by decline in the high single-digit range for the first half of the year, improving to a decline of mid single-digit by Q3, followed by a rebound to positive mid to high single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. This outlook corresponds to a gradual improvement in the employment picture through the fiscal year though it did not contemplate a full employment recovery. To help translate this trend into a single number you can anchor to, our guidance contemplates the U.S. getting to approximately 7% unemployment by June of 2021. Second, out-of-business losses. Our retention was negatively impacted by losses in its most recent quarter, as we had a number of clients turn inactive, but after monitoring and assessing, we decided to write-off as losses. While we believe government stimulus programs have helped many small businesses, we continue to see some companies in an inactive state where they are not paying employees. And we expect continued elevated losses in the early part of fiscal 2021 as restrictions and lower demand in certain industries continue to drive fall out. As a result, we are setting our expectation for ES retention to decline by another 50 to 100 basis points over this coming fiscal year. Lastly, on client fund interest. As discussed last quarter, our client balance growth is being impacted by the combination of a decline in pays per control, lower new business bookings and out-of-business losses and we had some modest pressure from companies taking advantage of the payroll tax deferral provision of the CARES Act. We are assuming a client funds balance of 6% to 8% for the year. And like pays per control, we expect it to be negative for the first three quarters and then return to growth in Q4. We expect our average yield to decline as well. As a reminder in Q4, we temporarily suspended our purchases of new securities and reinvestment of maturing securities in our client funds portfolio. And earlier this month, we resumed reinvesting. We have over $5 billion in securities maturing in fiscal 2021, yielding on average over 2% and we expect to reinvest them at prevailing yields that are well below that level. As a result, we expect our average client funds yield to be down 50 basis points to 1.6% for the year. With this combination of lower balance and yields, we expect interest income on client funds to be $390 million to $400 million, down about $150 million versus fiscal 2020 and we expect interest income from our extended investment strategy to be $430 million to $440 million, down about $125 million versus fiscal 2020. With that said, without the benefit of our client investment strategy, which utilizes laddered maturities, we believe the headwind to fiscal 2020 would have been even greater. Having covered the major macro topics for fiscal 2021 let me share with you how we are deploying our downturn playbook to manage expenses. We have concentrated on areas where we have excess capacity and on reducing discretionary costs, while maintaining investment in sales, products and our associates. And as we emphasized last quarter, we continue to have the strong cash flow profile and balance sheet strength to withstand impacts to our revenue without taking immediate actions on our investments. We said we would be thoughtful and strategic in assessing the most prudent path forward, a path that balances positioning for recovery against near-term margin performance. We have now had a quarter to assess our business capacity and needs. And during the fourth quarter, we identified businesses across ADP, where unfortunately, we didn\u2019t believe a recovery was likely in the near-term and therefore had excess capacity in service and implementation. In addition to taking specific headcount actions, we have further tightened on non-essential spend, including T&E and other discretionary spend. We are also continuing to move forward with our transformation initiatives. For the past few years, we have highlighted for you some of the discrete material initiatives that we have worked on and their estimated level of benefits. In fiscal 2019, we executed on our voluntary early retirement program, which yielded over $150 million in annual run-rate benefits. In fiscal 2020, we executed on our workforce optimization program and a procurement initiative, which together yielded approximately $150 million in annual run-rate savings against our original expectations of $100 million. For fiscal 2021, we have two important initiatives to call out. First, we are moving forward with a digital transformation initiative that leverages many of the capabilities we highlighted at our February 2020 Innovation Day, primarily to optimize our implementation and service in addition to enhancing efficiency in other parts of the organization. As examples, we are further utilizing automation in the implementation process, deploying additional self-service features throughout our platform, broadening the use of guided assist tools and expanding the use of chat and chatbot. We expect this to be a multi-year effort as we work to optimize large parts of our service delivery model. Our innovation agenda is running full speed ahead and that includes innovation in our client engagement. We also expanded our procurement transformation initiative and expect further benefit for fiscal 2021. We have reassessed our real estate footprint and although we had already closed over 70 subscale locations as part of our service alignment initiative in recent years. We recently closed several additional locations, including a large office in New Jersey. We will continue to evaluate whether there was further opportunity for location consolidation. Between these two initiatives, our digital transformation initiative and the expansion of our procurement initiative we expect to realize a combined $125 million in savings during fiscal 2021, with over a $150 million in run-rate savings exiting the year. Let\u2019s now turn to our outlook for fiscal 2021. We will start with the ES segment. We expect a decline of 3% to 5% in revenue for the full year driven by our outlook for a decline in pays per control, balance and yield pressure in our client funds interest portfolio as well as pressure from new business bookings and elevated out-of-business losses. Compared to what we just experienced in the fourth quarter, we expect the first half of fiscal 2021 to experience a slightly greater revenue decline as the incremental impact from lower sales out-of-business losses and lower client funds interest more than offset the gradual recovery in pays per control that we are anticipating. We expect revenue growth to improve modestly in Q3 and then turn positive in Q4. We expect our margin in the Employer Services segment to be down about 300 basis points for the year. And as a reminder, the revenues we lose from pays per control, out-of-business losses, and client funds interest are all high margin. As with revenue, we are expecting a decline in ES margin during the first three quarters and an increase in the fourth quarter. For our PEO, we expect revenue down 2% to up 2% for the full year with average worksite employee count flat to down 3% driven by similar factors as our ES segment, namely headwinds and same-store employment, out-of-business losses and bookings pressure. We expect average worksite employee growth to be negative during the first three quarters and turn positive in Q4. Our revenues, excluding zero margin pass-throughs, are expected to be down 1% to 4% and we continue to expect lower workers\u2019 compensation and SUI pricing. For PEO margin, we expect to be down about 100 basis points in fiscal 2021 driven in part by drag from higher zero margin pass-through revenues partially offset by a favorable compare for ADP Indemnity. With these segment outlooks, we now anticipate total ADP revenue to decline 1% to 4% in fiscal 2021 and we anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to be down about 300 basis points as the benefits from our continued expense management and transformation initiatives are partially offsetting the detrimental impact \u2013 margin impact of expected lost revenue due to COVID-19 as well as the investments we continue to make. We anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 23.1%. This rate includes less than 10 basis points of estimated excess tax benefit from stock-based compensation related to restricted stock vesting in Q1 of fiscal \u201821. But it does not include any estimated tax benefit related to potential stock option exercises given the dependency of that benefit on the timing of those exercises. Last quarter, we temporarily suspended our share repurchases as we decided it would be prudent to wait for stabilization of the overall environment. At this point, we anticipate resuming our share repurchase program at some point this fiscal year subject to market conditions and we have a slight net share count reduction contemplated in our guidance. And as a result of our outlook for lower revenue and margins and higher tax offset partially by lower share count, we currently expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to decline 13% to 18% in fiscal 2021. As most of you are aware, we also have $1 billion in notes due September of this year. At this point, we expect to issue new debt in the coming weeks or months depending on market conditions. I would like to conclude by saying that although COVID-19 is putting pressure on our financial performance, we believe this is transitory and the long-term prospects for ADP are no way diminished and may even be enhanced by the current environment. For fiscal 2021, we are remaining focused on opportunities for innovation and growth while taking a deliberate balanced approach to managing expenses and we are confident in our long-term growth prospects. I look forward to updating you on our progress. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Mark, yes, just to add a little bit more there in terms of by each segment for sure we are expecting sales growth across each of the segments in fiscal \u201821. And as Carlos said, down market seems to be resilient and has trended up since we were at the low point several weeks ago but down market has been trending up earlier. And then during the latter part of the year, we would expect up markets and international for that matter to continue along those lines, but for sure expecting sales growth across all segments. And to Carlos\u2019 point, from a long-term incremental perspective, certainly expecting Next-Gen HCM to be a driver there, but our strategic platforms in the near-term RUN and Workforce Now have been performing really well in the market and we expect them to continue to perform really well in the market as we recover through this. That\u2019s right. Yes, no, the gross bookings were slightly positive to what we had expected. The approximately, down 50% is right, which is what we have been anticipating. And then the backlog adjustment, which actually is part of our normal process factored into the overall bookings number being down slightly more than that for the fourth quarter. Yes, go ahead Carlos. It\u2019s a great question in terms of when do we return to previous levels of growth and profitability. And as you pointed out, a lot really depends on the shape of the recovery. And look, we have taken the best view we can and tried to share with you what we are thinking about that in terms of the shape of that recovery. But it really is going to depend on that. Last recession, it took a couple of years for sales and retention and revenue growth to return to the pre-recession levels. Now, is it going to look exactly like it looked last time? We don\u2019t know. This crisis is different. The make-up of ADP is different. So, I hate to say it, but it\u2019s going to depend on a lot of factors but returning to those previous growth rates certainly will not be in fiscal \u201821 based on what we see right now and we will update you as things change and as we go through the current year. Yes. Look, on the surface the guide to 300 basis point decline on the surface may sound like a lot, but there\u2019s a lot going on in there. When you take it apart, I think it\u2019s really \u2013 and you put it into the kind of buckets, I think you will see how we arrived at that guidance and that expectation, right? As we\u2019ve talked about and as you know we\u2019ve got obviously a substantial impact from loss \u2013 a very high margin revenue, right? We\u2019ve got that high margin revenue. We\u2019ve got clients on interest, which is a hurt on margin year-over-year. We also have growth in zero margin pass-throughs, which falls right to the bottom line from a margin perspective. That\u2019s going to be a significant hurt for us where it hasn\u2019t been as much in the past. And the continued investment along the lines of \u2013 look, we think it\u2019s prudent and smart to take to continue our long-term view and to continue to invest in sales and in product. We are committed to that level of investment so that\u2019s a hurt. And then you do have, as you pointed out, the transformation and other cost actions that we\u2019ve been taking that only partially offset that. So I would think about it in those buckets in terms of, look, you\u2019ve got this high margin revenue. You\u2019ve got some other things that fall right to the bottom line like zero margin pass-throughs and client funds interest. You\u2019ve got the commitment to continuing to invest and quite frankly, I think we have been executing really well from a transformation perspective and also in terms of looking at \u2013 as we navigate through this period the excess capacity cost that we have and being really smart about addressing those. Yes, and we did do a lot of work around and analysis around what happened in the last recession and what happened to retention by segment. And I think we have got a pretty balanced view if you look at the decline in retention that we experienced in Q4 and what we are guiding to and expecting and planning for in fiscal \u201821. It\u2019s basically in line with the retention pressure that we had during the last recession. So we will see. I mean, it\u2019s really hard to predict. And to tell what level of support the PPP program has had and is going to have, but that\u2019s our best view right now. So, Tien-tsin, thank you for the question, it\u2019s a logical question because when you think about kind of the past and the history over the last several years, right, in terms of what we\u2019ve been driving from a transformation perspective, you can see that we have had these \u2013 several kind of big major initiatives over the last several years, right. We had Service Alignment Initiative first. We have a Voluntary Early Retirement program. We told you about the workforce optimization and then the procurement and now the procurement continues and we have shared with you our work that we have doing around digital transformation. The question, what comes next? Quite frankly, I think there is a lot of runway and we have a lot to do from a digital standpoint and also from a procurement standpoint. It does get harder as you go, I will say, but there is a lot to do there. And a lot of the digital projects, first of all, the digital is certainly focused on our service and implementation, because there is opportunity there, but it is across the entire company. So every single segment and every single department, whether you are front-office or your back-office is tasked with thinking about digital transformation, automation, how do you make the work more efficient, how do you take work out? There is runway there. So I expect that you will hear us talking about that for some time to come. The procurement, well, it does get harder as you go. What I would say is, in an environment like this that we are in right now, in a downturn, it does present some procurement opportunities that may be didn\u2019t exist a year ago \u2013 when you actually \u2013 when you go back and you are negotiating with vendors and suppliers and so forth. So we have got real work to do there. And as you heard us say in the prepared comments, we have expanded procurement to make sure we are capturing all the opportunities. From a real estate perspective in terms of, look, the environment has changed. The way the world is working has changed. Let\u2019s make sure we are thinking about our real estate footprint in a fresh modern, forward-looking way to ensure we are utilizing the assets that we have to the fullest extent possible. We are understanding how we are going to get work done in the future. We are understanding how we can utilize mobility models where it makes sense to do that. So we have got a lot of work and some really good work to do here from a digital procurement real estate perspective. Yes, I mean, yes, it\u2019s a little bit hard to say, okay, compare one quarter to a full year particularly in a year like this when there is so much going on and there\u2019s so much linearity aspect in fiscal \u201821. But what I will say is in Q4 we did have sales expense, our NDE was actually a little bit of a help in Q4 versus it ends up being a surge so that\u2019s kind of one difference one to the other. And the other thing is, from a transformation perspective in terms of benefits and how the benefits flow, well, certainly being a favorable and a help for us in each year in fiscal \u201820 and in fiscal \u201821, in Q4 there is a pretty substantial impact favorability from transformation if you were to compare it to a full year fiscal \u201821. So it\u2019s kind of a math of how it all falls out in a quarter versus in a full year. But again, think about fiscal \u201820 as sorry, fiscal \u201821 as look, you have got this high margin revenue. You have got top line stuff that falls right to the bottom line being the zero margin pass-through and the client funds interest. You have got our continued commitment to investments. So you have got that from sales expense partially offset by continued transformation work."

            "content": "Thank you, Dany and thank you everyone for joining the call. This morning, we reported our fourth quarter and fiscal 2020 results. Although we ended the year \u2013 this year against significant headwinds related to COVID-19, we believe we executed well over the course of the last 12 months. And our product offerings remain well positioned to support sustainable long-term revenue growth as we continue to help companies and their workforces through all types of environments. For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $3.4 billion, down 3% reported and 2% organic constant currency, which was better than our expectations. And for the full year, we delivered revenue of $14.6 billion, up 3% reported and 4% organic constant currency. Our adjusted EBIT margin increased 10 basis points in the quarter and increased 60 basis points for the full year, well ahead of our expectations as we managed our expense base prudently to absorb the impact of a decline in revenue in the fourth quarter, while simultaneously providing an elevated level of service to our clients. With this revenue and margin performance, our adjusted EPS growth was flat for the quarter and up 9% for the year. Considering the unprecedented and evolving macroeconomic situation, we are very pleased with our execution in the quarter and our current positioning as employment continues to gradually recover from the steep declines our clients have experienced. The global health crisis from COVID-19 has clearly evolved over these past few months. And I will start today\u2019s discussion by providing a brief update on the trends we have experienced. When we reported our fiscal third quarter results in April, we were just starting to see some preliminary signs of stabilization after weeks of rapid deterioration, more specifically, across our own data sources, including weekly payroll, clock-in volume, job postings and background screenings. There were multiple indications that we were reaching the trough. Now 3 months later, we do believe we saw conditions bottom in late April. Whereas our pays per control was trending down mid-teens in April, it has since improved to be down about 10% as we exited the quarter. And for the full quarter, pays per control was down 10.8% better than we had contemplated in our outlook. Last quarter, we also discussed our expectation for elevated out-of-business losses in May and June. Those losses ultimately developed in line with our expectations. This yielded a decline in our retention rate of 20 basis points to 90.5% for the full year. Though if not for the elevated out-of-business losses in Q4, we believe our retention rate would have been up for the year. In fact, despite these losses in Q4 for fiscal 2020, we tied an all-time high retention for our mid-market and hitting multi-year high in our up-market. Looking ahead, what we have been encouraged by signs that the economic distress brought about by COVID-19 has started to ease in certain countries and several U.S. states. We are seeing continued or even increasing distress in others. And over the past several weeks, we have seen the pace of employment recovery slow. Accordingly, as we set our expectations for the coming year, we believe that the worst is behind us. But the global economic recovery over the coming quarters will be gradual. Kathleen will discuss some of our specific macroeconomic assumptions in more detail. I\u2019d like to turn now to Employer Services new business bookings. We reported a decline of 21% for the year, which was in line with our revised outlook despite the limited visibility we had in making that forecast. And although this represents a significant decline, the actual execution by our sales force was better than what this reported growth rate suggests. As we mentioned last quarter, there are two components to our bookings figure. Our gross bookings we actually sold in the quarter and adjustments for previously required bookings. Our gross bookings sold in Q4, while down significantly, came in ahead of our forecast, and most importantly, exited the quarter with improving momentum. This gives us confidence that buying behavior is continuing to trend in the right direction, which we believe will drive further bookings recovery in the coming quarters. Furthermore, our sales force has continued to adapt to this virtual sales environment as we have invested in training, stayed agile on sales messaging, and continued to foster our channel relationships. We are also continuing to see week-on-week improvement in leading indicators, such as referrals, appointments per salesperson and demos scheduled. In addition to these gross bookings, we regularly adjust bookings we have previously recognized if for example, a client is no longer expected to start within the original estimated timeframe or starting with fewer employees than originally anticipated. These backlog adjustments are ordinarily immaterial to our bookings growth. But as we said last quarter, COVID-19 is causing some clients to delay implementations or to start with fewer employees than we originally signed. We made a larger backlog adjustment in Q4 than previously planned. And this offset the better underlying sales performance we experienced. Looking ahead, we expect we will likely see negative bookings growth in the first half of fiscal 2021 as we are still selling into an unfavorable macro environment. We expect growth to be flat to positive in Q3 with much more substantial growth in Q4 driving full year bookings growth of flat to up 10%. Beyond fiscal 2021, a key priority will be getting our sales productivity back to or above its previous level. Within our control are the investments we make. And in fiscal 2021, we are planning to continue investing in product innovation, digital sales capabilities and leading-edge sales tools to drive sales productivity higher. In addition, at this point, we are planning to add modestly to the size of our sales force. And together, we believe these investments will position us well to return to our previous \u2013 to our prior new business bookings growth trend line as client buying behavior continues to normalize. Factors beyond our control, including overall GDP trends, as well as the timing and scope of workers returning to their job sites, were in the meantime likely continue to impact our bookings. Moving on, service has remained critical to our clients. Our clients look to us for support and guidance in navigating through the complexities of key HR challenges and regulatory change. And our goal has been to serve as a trusted partner as they faced COVID-19. Our clients have responded very positively to the robust service we have provided. And that in turn has led to record NPS scores in June as a direct outcome of our commitment to providing a successful level of service. And we expect this favorable NPS trend to have positive implications for us in the years ahead. In response to the initial surge in service volumes related to COVID-19, we redeployed hundreds of sales and implementation associates to help meet the service need. While average resolution time spent per service requests remains elevated as our clients work through complex issues, we have now seen our service request volume return to more normal levels. And we are happy to report that we have now deployed most of these associates back to their sales and implementation rules. We continue to keep watch on proposed legislation that could drive another surge in client service demand and we remain prepared for such a scenario. We also continue to serve our clients through product innovation. During the quarter, we rolled out a range of solutions to help our clients through the crisis and prepare for the recovery. We implemented over 1,000 feature changes in response to 2,000 legislative updates in 60 countries. And we also had over 400,000 clients run over 2 million Paycheck Protection Program reports for a total loan volume of approximately $115 billion. Many of those clients have also now run the necessary reports to apply for their loans to be forgiven. Looking ahead, a key product focus is enabling safe return to the workplace. And we are offering tools, including touchless and voice-enabled clocking, health attestation and enhanced scheduling and analytics to help clients manage their workforces as they resume workplace operations. We continually progress on our other major product initiatives, including the rollout of our next-gen HCM platform and payroll engines. 2 weeks ago, we won yet another award for our next-gen HCM solution, the Ventana Annual Digital Innovation award. And we remain excited about its rollout. Perhaps more importantly, despite shifting our workforce to remote environment, we remain on track to hit our R&D development roadmap milestones. And just this quarter, we piloted next-gen HCM and payroll in Australia. Our product team also launched our new workforce management solution in the down-market, like a new time kiosk in the Apple App Store. And we went general availability with Wisely Direct in our mid-market and down-market. Now, taking a step back, I\u2019d like to say that in every challenge, there is a potential for upside and COVID-19 is no exception. We believe that the nature of this shock in which businesses of all sizes have faced major uncertainties in managing their employees, have made an HCM partnership they have with ADP got much more valuable. And as companies emerge from this crisis, we expect them to see even more clearly the benefits of investing in robust, secure HCM offerings that include expertise and service to support their mission-critical activities. So, although COVID-19 has created temporary headwinds in our growth, past experience has taught us to stand firm regarding our investments in strategy as part of our commitment to drive long-term sustainable growth. The strength of our business model and balance sheet allow us to do exactly that. And we are well-positioned in our product, service and go-to-market strategy. Last, before turning it over to Kathleen, I would like to quickly touch on our plans for our own associates. Last quarter, we discussed having over 98% of our workforce operating virtually, including our sales force and we have been pleased with that transition and their overall performance in this environment. While we are well-positioned to continue operating this way, we are in the early stages of bringing back a small portion of our workforce to the office on a volunteer-only basis. And I am actually pleased to join you today from our Roseland headquarters, which we opened just this Monday. Our sales force will continue to primarily engage with prospects and clients virtually, but they are beginning to conduct face-to-face meetings in some geographies, to the extent that they and our clients and prospects are ready to do so. And with all that said, I would like to once again take a moment to recognize our associates for their outstanding effort and the sacrifices they have made. I understand the monumental task of managing work and home life is a complex situation. And I also know it\u2019s not easy. A heartfelt thanks to our associates and leaders for their commitment. I will now turn it over to Kathleen. Well, I think from an incremental standpoint \u2013 to start off with the last part of the question from a long-term standpoint, I think some of the investments we have made in some of our next-gen solutions, I think for me has to be one of the most optimistic in terms of potentially moving the needle from an incrementality standpoint right, because we already have a very large, as you know, bookings number and anything that we can add on top of that goes into the top of the funnel in terms of revenue growth. And that\u2019s really was the reason for these investments is to really move the needle competitively and to improve our position from a differentiation standpoint. And so the early signs of course now somewhat temporarily interrupted by COVID-19 were positive in terms of the traction we are getting both with our next-gen HCM platform as well as with our next-gen payroll platform. So that\u2019s kind of where I feel the most optimistic in terms of the long-term. In terms of kind of the cadence and more kind of the short to medium-term in terms of next year \u2013 really the fourth quarter is an important part as we have kind of been alluding to here in our prepared comments and some of that is really clearly the pace of the recovery. So, there is \u2013 we have an expectation, which I think is in line with generally accepted I think forecast, if you will. And you heard kind of as a proxy, the expectation that unemployment reach a certain stage by the end of the fiscal year end, those things are all proxies for GDP growth and you guys all have plenty of access to your own firms\u2019 economic forecast and so forth. So, the second half is really the key for us from a bookings standpoint. And there aside from the incrementality question, this issue that we have around for example, adjusting to our \u2013 adjustments to our gross bookings is an important one, because to the extent that the recovery continues on the pace we expect, it would help us a lot if we would be \u2013 if we can start and continue to implement clients that were previously sold and that \u2013 so clearly one positive would be that, that doesn\u2019t degrade any further, because in full transparency, we mentioned that in our prepared statements that\u2019s a concern under this kind of environment, but there is potential upside as well there. So there is downside and there is upside there as well. But when you see the incredible decrease in activity in just a couple of months following the beginning of the crisis, it takes a while for that \u2013 those buckets to get filled up again in terms of leads, then turning into first deployments, then turning into presentations to clients. So, that whole process of how the sales evolution goes is critical for us in the second half. And the places that were hurt the most, which in our case and some of it is perhaps just because of the nature of the crisis that the down-market was hit very, very hard in terms of pays per control and also just declines in activity, but also came back, frankly surprisingly \u2013 you can\u2019t call it strong because it is still down year-over-year, but I think the bookings performance in the down market has been I think gratifying. And so if we continue on that trend, that would be good news for the second half of the year. And then we expect based on the current trends that the mid-market and the up market will then kind of follow suit as the kind of pipeline leading indicators that we mentioned translate into actual bookings and actual sales. So I guess, the short story is the things that were the hardest hit are the things that \u2013 in the initial stages are the things that should have, in our opinion, the biggest rebound in the second half. And then on top of that obviously, our new product investments I think are a source of optimism for us. We\u2019ve also invested in I think you heard us mention Workforce Management in the down market. I mean, we have a lot of things going on. You can see it in our investments in technology over the last four to five years and obviously some of those things are longer-term like the next-gen stuff. Some of it has been we have been investment phase for 6 to 12 months and we expect those things to translate now into new sales. So I don\u2019t know if you heard our tone over the last several years, we pivoted to investing more in product and particularly more around Agile technology and that hopefully gives us some firepower here in terms of our bookings incrementality going into this year, but also into the following years as well. So on next-gen HCM, you could probably appreciate for two, three months, that wasn\u2019t really something that a lot of companies were focused on and for that matter us [indiscernible] unfortunate. But the good news is we did actually start a client just a week ago. So that is a ray of sunshine in what was otherwise a lot of dark clouds. So we had a number of clients that were set to be implemented in our fourth fiscal quarter, which delayed and one of those actually started here already in the early part of the first quarter. So that is encouraging but we are not that different from where we were before. So call it still a handful, I think we have like seven or eight clients live somewhere in that neighborhood on next-gen HCM. On next-gen payroll, there the target at the beginning from a piloting standpoint really was \u2013 clients are not quite the same size of next-gen HCM. So it\u2019s a slightly different dynamic and it\u2019s \u2013 and we\u2019re making, in terms of numbers of clients more progress, but it doesn\u2019t mean that the product necessarily is making more progress. It\u2019s just the difference between the markets we\u2019re serving. Next-gen HCM is really in the early stages aimed more at the mid-market, if you will, than really the up market even though we expect it to be our next-gen payroll engine across our mid-market and up market in the initial stages, it\u2019s really mid-market. So I think we have somewhere around 100 clients sold. And I think maybe that same number implemented, if I\u2019m not mistaken. So we\u2019re making some good progress there. And there the pace is a little bit better in the sense that we didn\u2019t come to a complete stop on next-gen payroll and we continue to implement clients there and kind of move forward. But it\u2019s a \u2013 this is a very challenging situation for our clients and we really need to kind of help them get through this situation and the crisis not necessarily press them to get started as quickly as possible although that\u2019s obviously our desire from our standpoint. Yes, we can hear. Yep, go ahead. Yes, I mean I think we \u2013 we\u2019re just trying to give a nod to our sales force in terms of \u2013 they were \u2013 they performed better than we clearly had forecasted and that we gave in terms of color, commentary during this same earnings call or during the earnings call of the last quarter, but they were still down significantly. So at the end of the day, we just want to make sure that you guys got the right impression that we weren\u2019t disappointed and that we didn\u2019t do worse than we expected. But from a mechanical number standpoint \u2013 think still down somewhere around 50% like if that\u2019s a fair characterization. I don\u2019t know if Kathleen has any more color there? No, go ahead, go ahead. I think, maybe just add a little bit of \u2013 just in terms of my own observations from looking at the kind of the quarterly cadence, if you will and how \u2013 what the implications are for FY \u201822, it really depends on \u2013 are we thinking about sales? Are we thinking about revenue? Are we thinking about profit growth? And they are all kind of different buckets. But I guess and to Kathleen\u2019s point, it really all depends \u2013 if this is unlike the financial crisis, not a two or three, the financial crisis really was \u2013 you go back and think about it, the kind of mini crisis that occurred over the course of the following two or three years. Remember, we had the European debt crisis. We had a number of things that elongated that situation, but that could happen here as well, and we are of course not scientists and we don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going to happen. But we\u2019re using kind of the same forecast that I think all of you are using and if you make those assumptions around when the healthcare crisis passes, i.e., vaccines and therapeutics and so forth. If you follow that path then FY \u201822, when we exit in the fourth quarter of FY \u201821 \u2013 from a mathematical standpoint \u2013 I think you used the term growth rates, the growth rates are going to look pretty good in terms of as you exit from a booking standpoint and then starting maybe with profitability in the first quarter of FY \u201822 because in the fourth quarter of FY \u201821 we saw some NDE expense. But some of that \u2013 frankly is really the comparisons. So we have three quarters in FY \u201822 that are going to look pretty good. Because if we still think that the first couple of quarters of FY \u201821 are still impacted pretty significantly by COVID and by the first couple of quarters of FY \u201822 you don\u2019t have that impact you are going to have some I hope some really good tailwinds on some of these growth numbers. But the key for me was looking at absolute booking dollars in the fourth quarter of \u201821 compared to the fourth quarter of \u201819 because obviously \u201820 is not a good comparison and looking also at our absolute profitability in the fourth quarter of \u201821 and our revenue in the fourth quarter of \u201821. And again, I feel some sense of optimism about \u201822 based on those exit rate assumptions with a capital assumption because this is \u2013 we are a long way away from having certainty and you have seen how fluid the situation has been. But I think the math I think works kind of favorably once we get through fiscal year \u201821 and particularly when we get through the first three quarters of fiscal year \u201821. Let me take a crack at a couple of high level things. And then Kathleen probably can provide some additional maybe detail to help in terms of quantify some of the stuff. But we \u2013 I\u2019m not sure if it was clear from our comments last quarter or this quarter but having been through these types of \u2013 not through a healthcare crisis but I personally have been through dot com downturn, Y2K at ADP, 9/11 and the Global Financial Crisis. And our Board is a Board that is long-term oriented and it feels like despite how horrible the situation is, it feels like this situation is transitory and so one of the things that we have as a first principle is to maintain our level of investment. That doesn\u2019t mean that we are not prudent around our expenses and I think we have been and I think Kathleen gave you some examples of some of the things that that we are doing. But we are going to add to our sales head count next year, which might surprise some people and maybe not something that you were expecting. And the problem is that when you model only one fiscal year for a company like ADP or recurring revenue model, if you decrease your sales cost or even your investment in product and technology, it actually looks quite favorable. And you can probably offset quite a bit of revenue decline. The question is, is that really the right thing to do long-term? We don\u2019t believe that it is and so that\u2019s one factor, philosophically. The second factor is that even though we clearly have some decline in the number of clients, the nature of the revenues that are going down is very high margin. So you mentioned client funds interest, but we also have another decrease from a comparison standpoint \u201820 to \u201821 in pays per control, which is call it 100% margin as well. And there is very little work related to the number of worksite, I am sorry, the number of employees paid by our clients. Our work is \u2013 workload is generally driven by number of clients and then as we have all now observed in the last quarter also driven a lot by the regulatory environment. And so the amount of work has not decreased much and in some cases has increased on behalf of our clients. And again, that\u2019s a place where we could cut some of that support. And then it would lead to lower NPS scores and we probably would have retention go down, but the single most important driver of financial value for ADP is client retention and lifetime value. To lose clients and then have to go sell them again and implement them again makes absolutely no sense and all the experience we \u2013 that I have and we have and our Board has tells us to kind of stand firm and make sure that \u2013 that doesn\u2019t mean that we ignore the realities around us. If we thought that this was a permanent decrease in capacity of the economy or in terms of the global outlook, and then it was going to last two, three, four years, we probably would be behaving differently, but that\u2019s not our expectation, that\u2019s not our \u2013 that\u2019s not the way that we are managing the company. There\u2019s also a couple of other items I think that mathematically may be not helping us and maybe Kathleen can help a little bit with some of those sure. But I guess let me \u2013 just to provide a little bit of color on kind of our view because I learned the hard way from my two predecessors about some of these things. So if you just look at the sales engine aspect of our business and you look at it over multiple years, you can actually do the math that if our \u2013 if we decreased our head count, call it 5% or even if we just kept it flat and you assume the productivity continued on kind of its normal trend, which is a big assumption, but if you even \u2013 if you assume that, you can see the impact that has on revenue growth from multiple years down the road. So obviously, if you expect that you\u2019re not going to be able to ever return to the same kind of sales productivity you had before, then you have to do something differently, but that\u2019s not the expectation we have right now. And it\u2019s critical to our growth in \u201822, \u201823, and \u201824 for us to maintain our investment in our sales engine. Not to mention in our product and our technology and a few other places as well. Again, let me give you some maybe philosophical, high-level comments and then Kathleen, maybe can give you some color around the fourth quarter and some of the assumptions. So in general, we have been, and I\u2019ve been again, having been through multiple downturns and crises, I have been surprised by the resilience of our retention and we think there could be a number of factors here. One of them could be all of the government stimulus, the Paycheck Protection Program, all these things might \u2013 these are all new things compared to the past that might be helping. There is also the potential that some clients are frozen in place, if you will, like, we\u2019ve talked about how difficult our bookings have been. I think logic would tell me that that\u2019s probably happening across multiple industries and multiple competitors. And so we would be \u2013 actually dishonest not to assume that that might be helping our retention in some parts of our business like the mid-market and the up-market because in the down-market it\u2019s really driven more by out of business. So having said all that, I would say that a lot of these things are really about timing because if there continues to be government stimulus and there continues to be optimism about this being transitory, then I think this kind of holds. And you have probably some additional fallout in the downmarket as a result of out of business and so forth, but you don\u2019t have kind of a major downturn or a collapse in retention. And that\u2019s kind of where I am today that we are expecting what I would say is \u2013 I would consider these to be reasonable and modest declines in retention when you compare them to other downturns that we have some data on and some history about. I think \u2013 I don\u2019t literally don\u2019t give it. But I think I feel like this is an environment where transparency is probably not a bad idea just to give you like \u2013 like, that\u2019s why we gave you kind of the gross bookings number besides the net bookings number because you guys need to model this stuff so you can understand what\u2019s happening here. But think the fourth quarter somewhere around couple of hundred basis point decline in retention, which I think again all things considered, I thought was, and most of that decline frankly came in the down-market. So, that to me feels like better than I would have expected 3 months before that. Again, I will maybe give some high-level comments and let, I think Kathleen give some additional detail. We have a very large menu of things that we can do. This company has a very, very long history of navigating through multiple changes in environments and multiple economic circumstances and now I think we will add to our repertoire managing through a major health crisis and a pandemic. And so, we have \u2013 I don\u2019t know how else to put it. We have a huge number of things that we could do, if necessary, and when necessary. This is an incredibly resilient business model. I recognize that this is unusual for ADP to be down the way we are, but it is what it is in terms of the economic circumstances around us. But believe me; we have a number of levers. So as I said, like some of these things are \u2013 and our business model are somewhat self-correcting. If in the unlikely event, there was a belief that there was a permanent impairment of kind of global economic GDP or growth vis-\u00e0-vis other industries or other companies, I think that we are in somewhat of a better place because the amount of money that we spend on NDE and on implementation alone would, at least for the short-term, would certainly enhance our bottom line and help us from a margin standpoint. That\u2019s not what we want because the real value to be created here is through growth \u2013 like, through profitable growth, not by kind of shrinking our way into profitability. But we have no intentions of allowing ourselves to underperform, if you will, on a long-term basis below what we have delivered for many, many decades. And that\u2019s what \u201821 is all about. But if circumstances change, we have a very long list and quite a lot of variable expense in our P&L and a very strong balance sheet and a very strong cash position. And just one last comment on that, the other thing that maybe is under-appreciated but it\u2019s worth mentioning here because again, we are typically not talking about these things as they are more longer-term, but if your question was really more about what\u2019s potentially next, longer-term and not just in \u201821, our next-gen investments are the largest potential digital transformation effort we have ever undergone. And we always focus on them around what they are going to do in terms of our winning in the marketplace and our sales growth and our revenue growth. But trust me when I tell you that the business cases for those investments and the progress we have been making over all these years, there\u2019s an enormous expectation for, call it automation, call it efficiency, whatever you want to call it and we don\u2019t usually talk about our tax engine, we talk about HCM and payroll. But one of those next-gen investments is our tax engine, which again there, the early signs \u2013 we already have a couple of hundred thousand clients migrated onto that platform. And when you see how quickly we are able to make these legislative changes in that platform and the cost structure and the cost of support again, I would be very optimistic that one of the largest transformation efforts we will be talking about in the future when we look backwards is these next-generation investments. I am hoping they are also going to lead to big growth incrementality and winning more market share in the marketplace, but do not underestimate the value of these investments in terms of our back-office and also our cost structure. I mean, I don\u2019t see how it can\u2019t. So and usually, I am not that optimistic or that definitive because if it were only the election, I would say, we will have to wait and see. But I don\u2019t, again, I am not usually a pontificator, but I just don\u2019t see how companies after all this don\u2019t reassess not just kind of how they do HCM and payroll and so forth, but so many other parts of their business model where continuity and resiliency and so forth are critical and that applies to the smallest client to the very largest clients. I think that for a lot of us, I don\u2019t think we are the only ones or the only industry or space where that\u2019s going to be a tailwind but it\u2019s hard to believe that this in a positive. Now, in what quarter and how do I qualify that because you have GDP going down, I don\u2019t know, 30-something-percent in the second quarter. Even if people were thinking about that, that wasn\u2019t really going to be a factor certainly in the fourth quarter. The question is how does that net out in the math, right, because you want to somehow be able to parse that out and understand how much of is incremental. And I can\u2019t necessarily do that scientifically but intellectually, it\u2019s hard to believe that it is in a tailwind going forward for us. And then on the election side, we like \u2013 we generally like change because \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t matter whether one party versus the other. We are apolitical as a company. But usually when there\u2019s change there is change and for employers. Employers are an instrument of policy of the government, it\u2019s how public policy gets effectuated whether it\u2019s through tax or all the various safety policies and \u2013 you are seeing all these changes in leave policies now to help manage through the health crisis. So that\u2019s all incredible, I think opportunity for us to help our clients and when there is opportunity to help clients, that\u2019s opportunity to sell new business as well. Thank you. You too. Sure. I mean, I think some of it is \u2013 Kathleen will go through some of the math but the client funds interest impact is much bigger I think going forward than it was in the fourth quarter because of the laddering that we do in our portfolio. The impact for example of bookings \u2013 we still had a lot of business starting because remember, there is a lag between bookings and starts. So I think you would all be very surprised by how much. Even though we had some delays in some \u2013 particularly for larger clients, we started a lot of business in the fourth quarter also and as kind of bookings decline now the starts and the amount of revenue that goes into the run rate declines as well as you move forward. And so you get that sales number back up again. So I think there are a number of just kind of mathematical realities that I think that hit us in the next two or three quarters in comparison the fourth quarter. But I think that, again, we are not going to do that, like, we are not going to provide quarterly guidance, but I would encourage you to attempt to do either a first half or a second half based on the tone that you are hearing from us or even attempt to do it by quarter because the view that we have of the fourth quarter, again assuming the assumptions are correct, I think paints a very different picture than the picture may be that you are getting by looking at a \u201821 number. I would also argue that when we talk about \u201821, its fiscal \u201821, which happens to be only 6 months of \u201821. For every other company out there when you talk about \u201821, you are talking about the beginning of January of \u201821 where everybody expects everything already to be back to normal and that is \u2013 in terms of assumption of things being back to normal. So it\u2019s a little bit maybe tricky in terms of the thought process and the math. But I don\u2019t know if Kathleen has anything to add on that? So that really comes through in the retention. So it\u2019s not really, we don\u2019t quote, unquote, write it down, right? So that really comes through in terms of the losses from a retention standpoint. We have like maybe others some clients that have quote, unquote stopped processing and, but they are still there, and so there is a question of which of those clients come back and which of those clients don\u2019t come back. But we have modeled in the down-market, this is really a down-market issue. We hope that it\u2019s a down-market issue. At least in prior economic cycle that\u2019s been the case. And I think you see it reflected in our retention rate, but it\u2019s very, very hard for us to say with any level of certainty, how that\u2019s going to exactly play out in the future. We have looked at all the prior downturns, and we know that there\u2019s probably some out of business that\u2019s still there that\u2019s going to occur. And a lot of this is, in this case is going to depend on government stimulus and whether there continues to be some support for small business or not and also just the overall level of GDP and obviously the overall pace of recovery in terms of people going back to spending on products that help small businesses survive. No, I think that\u2019s right. And again, hate to go back to, because I think I would encourage you like I am doing the focus on both growth rates, but also, because I know they are important in terms of models and so forth, but absolute numbers as well because if pays per control doesn\u2019t grow in the fourth quarter of fiscal year \u201822 we have a serious problem; like if there\u2019s not a big snapback of that number, like if there isn\u2019t a huge snapback of bookings, we have serious problems. And so the only thing that we think is not something that we want to model improving is interest rates because it just doesn\u2019t feel like is a basis for doing that, but I think if you take reasonable assumptions based on economic forecast, you do have a fairly significant snapback in terms of growth rates, if you will or improvement percentages. The question then is, what does that mean in terms of absolute numbers? And so if you still have 7% unemployment, by definition that unemployment rate is still higher than it was in the, call it third quarter of fiscal year \u201820 and that has some implications in terms of absolute level if you will, of pays per control and we have kind of modeled that in to our assumptions but for sure there\u2019s snapback in the numbers. There is no denying. I think the demand so far. Our experience in the PEO has been that it was kind of in line with the rest of the business. It looked a little more resilient in April, which you may have heard that tone from us but then May and June, pretty much in line with what was happening across, yes, In terms of bookings demand. And I think some of that is because of just the sales cycle. If you think about the PEO the sales cycle resembles more the up-market. The lower end of the up-market than it does the down-market, even though the average client size is small and that\u2019s because it\u2019s a high involvement product and high involvement sale because you are basically turning over all of your HCM including your benefits your workers\u2019 comp, etcetera. So, I think that\u2019s what we have seen in the short term. If you look at again 20, 25 years worth of history, I can\u2019t even believe I have been doing this for that long, but I started my career in the PEO and every time there is an economic cycle or a change, whether it\u2019s dot com or financial crisis, whenever there is a lot of theories. And I think the secular demand and growth of the PEO doesn\u2019t seem to be impacted by many things. So I would still expect that kind of solution to have a lot of legs for small and mid-size clients for a long time to come. In the interim, there could be ups and downs, because as you said if companies are quote unquote hunkering down and don\u2019t want to offer benefits \u2013 at least in our PEO part of the value proposition is benefits and so \u2013 but so far when you look at sales results, lead generation activity, etcetera, there is no reason to believe that the PEO won\u2019t recover in the same way that we expect the rest of the business to recover from a booking standpoint. It\u2019s a great question. I think you probably saw in our comments that we said that we observed in our data that there has been a slowdown in the last few weeks, so we are looking at the data weekly and we do look at it geographically, both globally in terms of by country but also within the U.S. by state. And as you would expect part of the challenge in the last several weeks and months has been in the places where you have seen some of the comeback in terms of the virus. The resurgence of the virus in kind of the southern states and also Texas and California, but nothing back to kind of the full shutdown that we saw in April, which is in line with what you are all seeing as well in the news and so forth. This is more about leveling off of growth rather than kind of a decline. So we have seen it in the same metrics that I talked about in the last quarter. So, I can see it in like the number of job postings and screenings and so forth that have \u2013 that were on an upward trend line and frankly it was certainly not a V, but it was a nice upwardly sloped trend language then it was translating into improved employment both in our numbers, but also in the government reported numbers, but we have seen a plateauing of that as of the last 2 or 3 weeks. And so that\u2019s something that we \u2013 fortunately we re-looked at our assumptions for fiscal year \u201821 the assumptions we have for pays per control for the first quarter are around what the pays per control exit growth rate was for the fourth quarter and based on this kind of plateauing that feels like the right place for us to be. And the problem is we don\u2019t want to necessarily go tweak the second quarter, the third quarter and the fourth quarter, because as you have seen over the last 3 or 4 months, 3 or 4 months ago we were actually thinking about opening our office in Orlando \u2013 in Maitland, Orlando, because everything was fine in Florida and nothing was happening in Florida and we didn\u2019t know what the hell we were going to do in New Jersey and New York. And as we sit here today I am sitting in the office in New Jersey and we are not opening anything in Florida. So, I think it\u2019s unfortunately a very fluid situation and you just have to keep an eye on all of these assumptions both at the macro level, but as you said, we have very detailed information and a heat map by state. And I would say that what you are hearing and seeing in the news is what we are seeing in the data. But what that\u2019s translating into is a plateauing or a leveling off of employment short-term so far, not a decline. Listen there is a lot of smart analysts out there and industry analysts out there that would probably be better answering that question. And they probably are going to need a little bit more time and information to answer that question. But I will answer it the same way that I answered it earlier today, which is I don\u2019t know by how much, but it\u2019s hard to believe that past the transitory nature of the situation that, that growth rate for the industry isn\u2019t at least what it is if not higher because and again, I am not trying to be arrogant that, that is only for HCM, but there are other industries that I think have, shouldn\u2019t have tailwind from these events, where the acceleration of people to using cloud services and using what I would consider to be outsourced services so that you can focus on your core business, but also have resiliency. I think and also so that you can improve efficiency and you can improve productivity of your workforce and improve engagement of your workforce. All of those things I think are going to get tailwind and it\u2019s across multiple technology sectors that I think are going to probably benefit on a longer term on a medium term and longer term basis from this unfortunate situation. Thank you. Thanks. So just a couple of final thoughts. One is I know I said it before, but we have navigated through a lot of issues over many decades. I have had the experience of being through several myself, whether it\u2019s the dotcom recession, what happened after 9/11, the global financial crisis, because in that case, it was really a synchronized global downturn and now this health crisis. And the one thing that I would say about ADP\u2019s business model regardless of I know the focus here is on the short-term, but if you stay focused on the long-term, it\u2019s an incredibly resilient business model, financial model, but also business model. The value of our products and our services is key and one small anecdote, I think we may have mentioned it in the last call. But as kind of this crisis unfolded we had to become like many other parts of the economy, we had to go and talk to governors and leaders, including the White House to make sure that we were deemed an essential service, because we needed to stay in operation. And so I don\u2019t know what better sign there is of a resilient long-term model than to be considered an essential service, because we definitely \u2013 we definitely are. We are glad we were there to help our clients will still be there to help our clients. But I think that speaks volumes to the long-term viability and also upside of the business that we are a critical service an essential service to the economy and to our clients. We are proud of that. And I am proud of what our associates did to live up to that expectation. And as to the next year again, I would just encourage everyone to think through kind of first half second half or even by quarter because at least for me assuming that we stay on the trajectory that we are on, which I realize is fluid, but with those assumptions the fourth quarter exit rate of FY \u201821 is really what I am focused on and not necessarily the short-term results of the first few quarters of FY \u201821 although we are going to do our best to perform as well as we can throughout that as well. And lastly, I know Kathleen said in her comments, but we are very proud to have delivered $1.5 billion in cash back to the dividends and $1 billion through buybacks through, which I think is also another sign of the incredible resilience. And I think cash flow generation capability of this business model in this kind of short-term hit that we are having to revenues and to profitability, I don\u2019t believe will impair our ability to continue that tradition of returning cash to our shareholders. And for that, I want to say that I appreciate the patience of our shareholders as well and all of you. And I thank you today for listening to us and for all your questions. And I wish you all a very safe summer as well. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Shannon, and I will be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanyal Hussain: Thank you, Shannon. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call and Webcast. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer.Earlier this morning, we released our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompany today\u2019s call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings by reportable segment.During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description and the timing of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measure, can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions. And with that, let me now turn the call over to Carlos.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you, Danny and thank everyone for joining our call. Before we can, I want to first say that our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been or know someone who has been impacted by COVID-19. Every day we hear about how much of a challenge it has been for employers and workers alike, including our own.I'd like to recognize our associates for rising to the challenge and delivering exceptional service to our clients despite the extraordinary circumstances they've had to face. To them, I want to say thank you. For our discussion today, we'll spend a little less time talking about the third quarter and more time on the current operating climate. And I'd like to offer a couple of upfront points.First is that ADP is not immune to the global pandemics impact on the labor market, but while we may make tactical adjustments as we navigate through this crisis, we believe our long-term strategy is unaffected and we remain optimistic about how we're positioned over the coming years, once the business environment and our clients return to more normal operations. The second point is that we will continue to serve our clients in the way we know best, by offering the tools, resources, and support they need to manage their business and their workforce through all types of operating environments, including this challenging one.With that said, this morning we reported our third quarter fiscal 2020 results with revenue of $4 billion up 6% reported and organic constant currency and in line with our expectations. We expanded our adjusted EBIT margin by 60 basis points in the quarter, which was ahead of our expectations, even though it included an unplanned [$50] [ph] million global associate assistance payment in response to COVID-19. And with the solid revenue and margin performance, we were pleased to deliver 8% adjusted diluted EPS growth, which was also a slightly ahead of our expectations coming into the quarter.Turning now to the current situation, I'd like to take a few minutes to go deeper on how COVID-19 has affected our operations and what we've done to respond. As the situation evolved over the past couple of months, we focused first on the safety of our associates. In March, we took steps to quickly shift over 50,000 of our associates to work from home and now have approximately 98% of our workforce working remotely in a secure manner. In doing so, we leveraged our previous investments in business resiliency and in addition we ordered thousands of laptops, expanded remote access capacity, provided at home internet and for those critical personnel that needed to work onsite, we took steps to ensure their safety while they perform those essential onsite tasks. This was a huge undertaking by our global IT, security and legal, and HR organizations and I'm extremely proud of their execution.We also worked with our critical third-party service providers to ensure they were positioned to continue to support us. In March, we also had our field sales force shifts from in-person to a virtual sales model, and while that's not an ideal circumstance for some of our quota carriers, they're making the most of the situation. While we were executing on these business resiliency plans, we also worked nonstop to address our client's needs to ensure uninterrupted service across our HCM solutions. We provide a mission critical service and process payroll for one in six Americans and over 40 million workers around the world, and to offer immediate support we\u2019ve provided a number of online resources including an employer preparedness toolkit and webinars attended by tens of thousands of clients. We also quickly made available for free the payroll costs and headcount reports necessary to apply for forgivable loans under the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act and these reports have been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times.Service is more important than ever in times like this. We saw call volumes increased significantly beginning in March and have nearly 2 million inbound requests across our service channels in a matter of weeks, with clients looking for help with a variety of issues including adding custom pay codes related to COVID-19, redirecting checks to different locations and requesting new time tracking hardware that doesn't require physical contact. In many cases they were simply seeking general guidance in understanding new legislation. To meet our client's needs we retrained and quickly redeployed hundreds of associates to where they were needed most. And our service and IT teams worked quickly to digest and translate new legislation from the many jurisdictions around the world into our global payroll, time and attendance and other systems in a short period of time to allow our clients to comply with and benefit from these changes in legislation.As the environment for companies continues to evolve, whether due to legislative changes or operational realities, we at ADP are committed to supporting our clients to help them best navigate those changes. As we communicated in an open letter to U.S. policy leaders, ADP stands ready to facilitate current and future initiative that provides support to our clients and their workers. And in support of our local communities, ADP has made over $2 million in donations to relief efforts, including a dedicated relief fund for ADP associates that needed assistance as well as donations of medical supplies for hospitals, food banks, and their workers.With all that said, the significant impact of COVID-19 is having on a broader economy, is in turn having an effect on our reported metrics, in a much more abrupt fashion as compared to previous macro economic slowdowns. You can see this in our Employer Services new business bookings metric. This quarter we reported a decrease of 9%, as we saw bookings declined significantly and rapidly in mid-March when we typically would have expected to close many deals for the quarter. These results were of course well below our expectations coming into the quarter and while some of our businesses performed slightly better than others in March, the weakness was generally broad-based as the health crisis is affecting companies of all sizes and regions including internationally.We believe the impact to bookings stems from two factors. First is the buying behavior of our clients and prospects. As with prior uncertain economic environments, our clients and prospects have become time and resource-constrained and are faced with reassessing their own operations to best ride out the impact of this health crisis. And although our products support mission-critical functions, making decisions about additional HCM services or making the decision to switch from another vendor to ADP can get put off to a later time. Even in circumstances where decisions have already been made, clients are understandably delaying implementation which can also cause us to adjust down the bookings we record. The general change in behavior is common in recessionary periods and we are certainly not surprised to see it this time. It's clearly happening in a more abrupt manner compared to what we've experienced in the past.Second, as I mentioned earlier, there have naturally been constraints that limited the activity of our salesforce. What we have been able to lean more heavily on an inside sales strategy and virtual interactions by our field sales force. There has still been a reduction in our salesforce productivity. Our sales organization is experienced and resilient and we will continue to work hard in the fourth quarter. Because of a variety of factors which we believe will have an outside impact on the fourth quarter booking, including the effectiveness of the Paycheck Protection Program in supporting small to mid-sized businesses and how quickly our clients can adapt to working in this new environment and resume more normal buying behavior, there is clearly a very wide range of outcomes.But to calibrate your expectations, we are guiding for a full year ES New Business Bookings, our ES New Business bookings to be down 20% which implies our fourth quarter bookings will be down by more than 50%. With all that said, we remain confident in our product portfolio and optimistic about our ability to drive sustained growth in ES bookings in a sounder economic environment.I now like to spend a minute or two on some of the other macro driven trends we've observed in our client base. Our pays per control metric, which represents employee growth for a broad subset of our client base was solid through February, but decelerated to a slight negative growth by the end of March, averaging 1.9% growth for the quarter. Early in April, we saw it deteriorate further to a double digit negative decline, with the steepest decline among smaller businesses. For context, this level of pays per controlled decline is significantly worse than even the worst quarter in the financial crisis, underscoring that it's hard to compare this environment even against the past recessions. While we hope that legislation aimed at preserving employment will drive a recovery in pays per control, we had not seen it through mid-April.On retention, we were actually pleased with our performance in the third quarter, with both third quarter and year-to-date retention performance better than our expectations and ahead of pays per our previous annual guidance. We set all time third quarter retention record in our down market and mid-market businesses, as client satisfaction scores were at or near all time highs and as the benefits of our technology and migration strategy over the past several years continue to bear fruit. But clearly, out-of-business losses are a concern for the fourth quarter and beyond. And although they have not yet meaningfully picked up by the end of March or even into April, early indicators of stress in our client base have shown up and we expect deterioration in retention in May and June.Kathleen will share some of the assumptions for the fourth quarter when she goes through the outlook. I'd like to pivot now from the current macro environment and focus on our strategy and what we're doing to drive longer term value for our clients.At ADP, we remained steadfast in our commitment to lead in the HCM industry with best-in-class technology and service. At our February, Innovation Day we shared an update with many of you about the innovation we are driving across our key strategic and next gen solutions. The HCM industry is an exciting place with constant change and we will continue to invest to position ourselves to meet the evolving needs of our clients over not just the coming years but the coming decade.At Innovation Day, we've covered several topics and I'd like to reframe a few of our key products against today's backdrop. With ADP RUN we help small businesses manage their essential HR tasks from basic payroll to a full HCM suite. We highlighted our push-to-drive digital sales and onboarding capabilities1 which is especially relevant in today's environment and we also highlighted innovations in automating service and implementation which relieves pressure on our service organization. We discussed Workforce Now and our public cloud native version that we are pairing with our next gen payroll engine, which utilizes a fully transparent policy-based model for improved implementation, maintenance and self service as well as continuous payroll calculations for clients looking for on-demand pay options.We also talked about Wisely and the ease of use and the financial tools that make an attractive \u2013attractive way to get paid. And just this month we made Wisely Direct available to our mid-market Workforce Now clients, which we believe will be beneficial to the many workers in our base that still get paid by a paper check. And of course we discussed our next gen HCM, which we believe represents a big step ahead of current offerings in the market and for which we remain excited about scaling and selling more broadly.Before I turn it over to Kathleen, I'd like to take a moment to once again thank our associates. This health crisis and the resulting economic fallout hasn't been easy on anyone, but our associates have really stepped up to ensure we continue to provide our clients with the support they need, and our clients and I appreciate it, Kathleen, I'll turn it over to you now.\nKathleen Winters: Thank you, Carlos and good morning everyone. As Carlos mentioned, we were generally pleased with our execution in Q3 and our financial results were not significantly impacted by COVID-19, with the exception of New Business Bookings. We expect Q4, however, to be challenging on a few fronts. And I will cover this when I go through our guidance.This quarter\u2019s revenue growth of 6% reported and organic constant currency was in line with our expectations. Our adjusted EBIT margin was up 60 basis points compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, even though it included a $50 million cost of a global associate assistance payment related to COVID-19 which we disclosed in an 8-K several weeks ago. Excluding this, our margin performance was even further ahead of our expectations and continued to benefit from a combination of cost savings related to our transformation initiatives and operating efficiencies, as well as lower than expected incentive compensation expenses. These benefits were partially offset by growth in PEO zero-margin benefits pass-through expenses and amortization expense, as well as certain other expenses related to COVID-19. Our adjusted effective tax rate increased 30 basis points to 23.8% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.92 driven by revenue growth and margin expansion, as well as fewer shares outstanding compared to a year ago.Moving on to segment results. In our Employer Services Segment, revenues grew 3% reported and 4% organic constant currency, reflecting steady underlying performance with strong retention trends offset by continued FX pressure and a growing headwind from interest income. Interest income on client funds declined 5%, and average yield on client funds declined 20 basis points to 2% offsetting growth in average client funds balances of 4% to $31.3 billion. This growth in balances was driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control in the quarter, partially offset by lower SUI collections and the closure of our Netherlands money movement operation earlier this year. Our Employer Services same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. was 1.9% for the third quarter and I\u2019ll talk a bit more about the trends we\u2019re seeing in a moment. Employer Services margins increased 100 basis points in the quarter, ahead of expectations and driven by many of the same factors I mentioned earlier when discussing our consolidated results.Our PEO segment revenues grew 11% for the quarter to $1.2 billion, and average worksite employees grew 7% to $595,000 ahead of our expectations and driven by strong year-to-date new business bookings. We were pleased with this re-acceleration in our Worksite Employee growth in the third quarter and believe we would have been positioned for further acceleration exiting the year if not for COVID-19. Revenues excluding zero margin benefits pass-through grew 9% to $490 million and continue to include pressure from lower workers' compensation and SUI costs and related pricing. PEO margin expanded 10 basis points in the quarter in-line with our expectations.Let me now turn to our outlook for the remainder of the year. I'll start by discussing some of the specific macro driven factors that affect our financial performance. I'll caveat by saying that we're clearly operating in an evolving and uncertain situation and we're using data currently available to us to make reasonable assumptions on which we are basing our guidance.First out-of-business losses, we expect our retention to be impacted by elevated out-of-business losses in Q4 and although the federal government is providing stimulus to help companies continue operating, we're seeing clear strain on our client base and have observed certain leading indicators; such as companies going inactive and no running payroll, many of whom will restart their operations at some point, but some of whom we expect will not. Based on our experience with these leading indicators, we are building in an expectation for additional losses in our fourth quarter outlook and as a result we're lowering our full-year retention guidance to be down 30 basis points to 50 basis points despite running ahead of our expectations on a year-to-date basis.Next, pays per control. We exited March with negative pays per control growth and in April it deteriorated to a double-digit decline. We were assuming a 2% to 2.5% pays per control decline for the full year, which implies a mid-teens decline for Q4. As a reminder of how this affects us, we have varied contracts throughout our businesses that blend base fees and per employee fees and we also often utilize shared pricing and have certain annual revenues that are not as affected. As a result with our current mix of business, the direct revenue impact we expect to see is about 25 basis points in ES revenue growth for every 1% change in PPC. Some of our businesses are more sensitive to pays per control than others and so the precise neck that pays per control by business can drive the actual revenue impact higher or lower in any given period. This direct impact also doesn't include the impact from our volume based businesses like recruiting or payment cards.Finally, on client funds balances, through the combination of a challenging sales environment and anticipated increase in out of business losses, a decline in pays per control and potential decline in wages and hours worked we expect to see pressure in our balances in the near-term. Furthermore, the CARES Act has a provision that allows companies to defer the payment of the employer portion of payroll taxes, which represents less than 5% of our average client funds balance. But depending on the actual take rate of that provision, we could see further pressure on our balance growth. As a result of all these factors, we now expect 1% balance growth for the full year, which implies a low double-digit decline in the fourth quarter. To adjust the size of our client's fund investments to match expected changes in average client payroll and tax volumes.Beginning in March, we halted all new reinvestment of maturity in our client long and extended portfolios. And in April we took the additional step of selling approximately $1.2 billion of previously purchased securities in the client long and extended portfolios. This decision to suspend new purchases means our Q4 interest income forecast reflects a slightly greater skew to overnight rates than previously forecasted. Both the suspension of new purchases and the completed sale of securities is contemplated in our guidance. To be clear, these decisions represent tactical adjustments and do not represent a change to our overall client funds strategy.Let's now turn to our revised outlook for the full year and start with the ES segments. We are lowering our guidance to 1% to 2% revenue growth versus our prior outlook of 4%, driven mainly by an expectation of lower paid per control, new business booking, client fund interest and retention versus our prior outlook. Much of this lost revenue comes at high incremental margins and as a result and also due to additional costs related to COVID-19 we now expect our margin in the employer services segment to be down 25 to up 25 basis points.For our PEO, we saw good momentum up through the end of March and as I mentioned earlier, we believe we were on track for continued acceleration exiting the year, but are now layering in our expectation for layoffs and furloughs and additional out of business losses. As a reminder in our PEO segment, we earn revenues as a percent of the gross payroll we process and as a result we are more directly tied to changes in our client's head count and hours worked as compared to our employer services segment. As a result of these assumptions and our expectations for lower Q4 PEO sales, we are lowering our average work site employee growth expectations to 3% to 5% from 7% to 8% previously. We are likewise lowering our revenue guidance and now expect 5% to 7% PEO revenue growth in fiscal 2020 and 3% to 5% growth in PEO revenues excluding zero margin benefits pass-through.As we also discussed throughout the year, we continue to expect lower workers' compensation and SUI costs and related pricing to pressure our total PEO revenue growth. Though we could see those trends change in the coming years. For PEO margin, we now expect to be down 100 basis points to 125 basis points in fiscal 2020. As we noted in previous calls, this outlook continues include pressure from smaller favorable reserve adjustment that ADP Indemnity in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, but we now expect about 75 basis points of pressure compared to our previous expectation of 50 basis points of pressure. So we still expect a slight benefit this year.With these changes to the segment, we now anticipate total revenue growth of about 3% in fiscal 2020 as compared to our previous outlook of 6%. This revenue outlook continues to assume slight FX unfavorability for fiscal 2020. As I mentioned, we anticipate our growth in average client funds balances to be about 1% compared to our previous outlook of 4% and we expect the average yield earn on our client funds investments to be about 2.1% compared to our previous outlook of 2.2%. We expect interest income on client funds to be $540 million to $550 million and for interest income from our extended investment strategy to be $550 million to $560 million.We anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to be down 25 to up 25 basis points, as the benefits from our workforce optimization and procurement transformation initiatives are now being offset by the impact of expected loss of revenue due to COVID-19 as well as incremental expenses related to COVID-19 including the [$50] [ph million in global associate assistance payments.We now anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 22.9%. The rate includes this quarters unplanned tax benefit from stock based compensation related to stock option exercises. It does not include any further estimated tax benefits related to potential future stock option exercises. As a result of our lower revenue and margin outlook, we now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 4% to 7% in fiscal 2020. In light of this revised 2020 guidance and multiple headwinds created by the global pandemic and the uncertain and evolving situation we are withdrawing the fiscal 2021 targets that we set out at our 2018 Investor Day as they are no longer appropriate to the current circumstances. However, we continue to believe in our long-term strategy and well positioned to continue to invest to execute this strategy.Finally, before I conclude, I'd like to talk about the strength of ADP\u2019s business model and balance sheet. We have a highly cash generative business with low capital and the HCM Solutions we provide give critical support to our clients, HR and management functions, especially at times like these. In addition to having a resilient product and business model we also have a significant buffer between our free cash flow and our modest debt obligations and our cash to spend, this enables us to absorb the impact of downturns and continue to prioritize investments aligned with our longer term strategy as well as our commitments to shareholder friendly actions.So although our revenue growth can clearly be impacted by challenging macro conditions, our recurring revenue model and high retention rate positions us to continue the type of investments we highlighted at our innovation day even when times are tough. We will meanwhile continue to manage our cost base prudently. We have instituted hiring containment and started to execute on our recession playbook with a preplanned set of areas where we will see some of our expenses self-adjust, such as management and sales incentives and we will eliminate or defer non-essential staff. We're working through an evolving and uncertain situation and are formulating our approach for next year and we will of course provide you with our expectations and outlook for fiscal 2021 when we report our fourth quarter results. As always, expect us to be balanced in our approach.With that, I will pass it back to Carlos for some comments before we go to Q&A.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thanks, Kathleen. Before we move on to the Q&A, I just wanted to share with you an excerpt of one of the many notes we received from our clients that that captures how we want to define ourselves. This one said, we are a small business that has used ADP for quite a few years now, every time we call there has been a knowledgeable professional at ADP that immediately solves the problem and answers the question.We recently needed payroll data to apply for the COVID-19 payroll protection program. I immediately went to ADPs website to see how I should go about selecting and downloading the required payroll data. Imagine the relief when opening the screen there was a COVID-19 pop-up that proactively provided your clients with the payroll data needed, I was floored. This type of customer service is unheard of these days. We just want to tip our hats to everyone ADP for a great job. As this client suggests, the value of a true HCM partner becomes even more critical at times like these. And it continues to be our goal to exceed the expectations of our clients.And with that I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I hope you both are doing well. I wanted to ask about your visibility on the paycheck protection loan program in terms of, can you see that it's having the desired impact on businesses in the country? Are you seeing [indiscernible] terminated workers that are being brought back on book? And I guess just tying that back to your own performance or potential future performance, are you seeing the leading indicators of bankruptcy sort of staved-off a little bit in your book?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Great question, we're obviously keeping our eye on that. Unfortunately what we have is really kind of limited anecdotal evidence that people are beginning to get money to be able to continue their payroll, they continue to pay people. As an example, a few days ago I was forwarded a letter that was sent to \u2013 an email that was sent to one of our associates from a client that was grateful for kind of the help that we gave them in applying for the loan and they sent a kind of a screenshot of their bank account that had $10 the previous day and then now had $84,000, like indicating that they have gotten their money from the SBA deposited into their commercial bank account. But I think as you've heard same as us in the press, the process has been given the magnitude of the scale of the challenge it's been a difficult process both for the SBA and I think for the banks, we've tried to do our part to help and we're optimistic and we're hopeful that it will make a difference and that there will be rehiring and that it will at least in some respects stop the furloughing and the elimination of jobs going forward. But unfortunately it's just a little too early for us to give you any kind of concrete evidence other than some anecdotal stories that money is making its way into the bank accounts of small businesses.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. Yes, that's helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up. In terms of your overall product strategy in the context of this crisis, are there any kind of adjustments you're having to make in terms of how you're thinking of new challenge, employees work from home, [indiscernible] time and attendance offering and also just on some of your major initiatives like Lifion? How\u2019s the timeline, the market being impacted, how are you thinking about the product set sort of evolving from here on out?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I mean, clearly we have to be nimble, and I think remain open to making further adjustments, but I think it's safe to say that if you go back over the course of decades, the concept of \u201coutsourcing\u201d and now what some people would call the SaaS models, which I think ADP was kind of one of the pioneers of, I think by definition, lend themselves to these kinds of remote work environments, whether it's for the technology people, because we generally obviously host and maintain and update the \u2013 all of the systems for our clients. But also through the variety of portals we have for our clients and the employees of our clients. All of the information that anyone needs is available online through all the tools we have to access that information, whether it's for the payroll practitioners or for the employees of our clients. Including, when you think about the app that we have for the employees of our clients to be able to check whether they've gotten paid, they can check their hours; they can make changes to 401(k). There's no really no need to move paper or for anyone to be in the office to do that kind of work. So clearly there will be things that we will learn and we'll probably hear in the early innings of this kind of new talent and how it might affect our products. But I think in general as an industry, it's not just for ADP, I think in general for us as an industry we're pretty well positioned I think for this kind of work environment.\nKathleen Winters: And I think if I could just, yes, if I could just add to that. I think you had asked about, I couldn't quite hear, but I think you had asked about Lifion and any updates to that and changes to our view on go-to-market. I would say over the longer term, while certainly this year looks like things have slowed down at least for a little bit, I'd say over the long-term, no change to how we're thinking about that. And we're got a handful of live clients. We're continuing to sell clients on and implement clients on Lifion, and we're encouraged about the long-term prospects there.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes. It's clear, like every time that we have, whether it's an economic downturn or now this is obviously a new challenge, there's always questions about, will this drive greater adoption? I think intellectually it makes sense that this would drive greater outsourcing and greater adoption of a SaaS, but it's kind of hard to make that statement kind of where we are today, but theoretically and intellectually two or three years from now, there should be more demand and more people using SaaS solutions than there are today.\nRamsey El-Assal: That makes a lot of sense. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi, thanks so much. Appreciate the extent of disclosure here. Just on the \u2013 some of the follow-up to Ramsey's question, just on the sales performance side, you mentioned productivity challenges in addition to the demand factors. What would you think you'll get your productivity back on track and align your sales to where you see the puck going next in terms of demand as it evolved?\nCarlos Rodriguez: So we're trying to actually keep an eye on it week-to-week to get some sense of what levers there are still there. We clearly still have, our sales force is still selling and they're selling a lot of business, but at lower level than obviously we had expected and in lower levels and you compare it to the previous year. So unfortunately given the nature of the situation, it's kind of difficult to give you a kind of scientific or concrete answer. I think as we generate more information, I think probably for our guidance for next fiscal year, we'll be able to \u2013 I know that's not helpful to you today, but it's really a very difficult thing to talk about.We have a lot of, our salesforce was already what we call an inside salesforce and so we've proven that we can sell through insight selling, but we have some products that are what I would call high involvement decision sales. And it doesn't mean that those can't be done remotely. But it hasn't been the norm. So when you sell a very large complicated multinational solution, or frankly, even when you sell the PEO, historically there's been a relationship that's built there and a trust that gets built before that transaction gets consummated.So it clearly, this is \u2013 these are new and different times. So I don't think everyone is going to sit and wait around for everything to go back to normal before making decisions. But I think it's safe to assume, I think common sense would tell us that it's safe to assume that, there will be some level of hesitation and pull back in terms of decision making. Even though a good percentage of our salesforce is still outselling as they have before, although they're doing it virtually now.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes. Sure. So we'll check in with you on that again next quarter. So then my quick follow-up, both of you have talked about cost initiatives. You guys did much better than we thought on the margin side even with the [$50] [ph] million. But you've also both hinted at a pipeline of more cost take out, potentially pre the pandemic. So I'm curious, your willingness to pull incremental expense leavers maybe some chunkier stuff, is that available to you and are you willing to do that at this stage?\nCarlos Rodriguez: So we did have a number of transformation initiatives underway. A lot of them were really around digital transformation efforts to kind of automate and improve the way our implementation or our services is delivered, which would create a better experience for our clients, the employees of our clients, frankly also for our associates that we thought would result in lower costs going forward. Yes, part of the challenge we have is as and again, every company may be different in terms of how they approach their level of support for their clients, but based on our model and the way we see ourselves playing a role, and frankly in society and with our clients, we've actually experienced quite an increase in volume and cost in the short-term.And so as an example, as the government rolled out the payroll protection program, we saw 40% to 50% spikes in inquiries right through whether it's phone or chat or by or by email. And so we had to work people overtime. We had to work people on weekends, which we're very grateful that people were willing to do, because you can imagine they've got lots of other concerns and distractions as this is all going on. And so we made a commitment that we're going to deliver to our clients through this and help them work through it, whether it's for themselves or for their employees. And unfortunately, I would say in the short-term, we actually have an increase in cost.Now, realistically that's not going to continue indefinitely. But every week that we said we think our call volumes and our workloads are going to go down, there's a new government program or a change in the government program, which by the way we think is great. I think that the efforts by the Fed and by policy makers, I think to help clients and their employees, I think is the right thing to do and we're very supportive. But as an example, there was just, as you know, there was an approval of an additional amount for the payroll protection program, which generates additional volume for us. By the way, I think the banks are in the same \u2013 probably in the same situation in terms of how having to handle kind of increase the volumes. And so we expect these levels to normalize and then to be in a position where we can reevaluate our cost structure, but again, given the timing of this call and where we are today, we really can't tell you that there has been a meaningful decline in our workloads. In fact, it's actually been an increase.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Got it. I appreciate the work behind...\nKathleen Winters: So, Tien-Tsin if I could just \u2013 let me just add a little bit more to that because I made some comments on our transformation efforts and transformation work even with the significant increase in service demand. So, even with this kind of very abrupt disruption and need to move our entire \u2013 practically our entire workforce to work from home. We will able to do that almost seamlessly. I mean, that worked really well through the huge, huge efforts of many of the different parts of the organization, from our technology groups to our HR to legal. I mean, it was a huge effort, but it worked well and so that we've been able to continue our normal processes, if you will around transformation work. There were certainly some projects that we have to look at and assess and say, okay, because of the big service demands we may need to slow down these.But our process in terms of tracking progress, continuing to execute, adjusting as necessary based on service demands and importantly continuing to look at pipeline of projects, that continue and I would just add one further comment that in particular in this environment, the ability to look at procurement and find procurement opportunities is potentially even greater today than it was, say three or four months ago.\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think if I can just one more just comment, I think that the \u2013 the part of the challenge here is that we are \u2013 the nature of our company and our business and our Board is to not focus on one month or one quarter. And I think when you look at we're able to deliver just in this quarter in terms of margin improvement and we've been able to do in the last couple of years, I think demonstrates very clearly our ability to, I think achieve and take advantage of operating leverage and also to manage our cost very effectively.We've had a couple of years with a very modest, if any cost \u2013 true cost increases while revenues were growing at what for us is our very healthy rates. So I think we've demonstrated what we can, what we can do, but unfortunately we've been handed a very abrupt change here in the environment and we're going to handle it first to take care of our associates, next take care of our clients. And I think when we get through this transitory period, which we all know is transitory, now we don't know is a transitory for a month or two or is it transitory for six months. But either way it's not multiple years and we want to make sure that we continue to invest in our business, take care of our people and take care of our clients that when we come out of this, we come out of it as strong as we were before we went into it.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes. Very clear. It\u2019s just the case. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thank you and thanks for the guidance and obviously the tough environment. Any thoughts on, one question we get a lot is how much of the layoffs are going to be furlough versus structural? So just any sense within kind of the pace for control, how much of that would be potentially furloughed workers versus structural? Maybe start there?\nCarlos Rodriguez: It's a great, question. So we have, as you know we operate in multiple countries and offer multiple segments; small business, midsize national accounts, but also in many countries and also multinational companies. And the policies that companies have around how they treat employees is going to vary from company-to-company and generally also varies from segment-to-segment. But what we can tell you is that, the way we count pays per control is very straightforward. It's whether or not someone got paid during that period of time that we're counting. And so we would not probably be able to give you a firm number of how many people are furloughed versus how many people are laid-off because we don't control necessarily that coding in the system. And clients can exercise some discretion about how they, I guess tagged some of their employees.But what we do know is that if somebody doesn't get paid, they don't get counted in pays for control. And if they do get paid, even if it's at a reduced wage, that does count and so that creates a number of challenges obviously. Because you could have reduced wage levels, which then doesn't negatively impact pays per control, but impacts the employees themselves. And may in some cases, impact our fees generally wouldn't other than in the PEO, but could impact our fees as well.So I would say that the best thing to do is to stick to \u2013 trying to use the pays per control metric as a way of building your models and using the guidance that we provided around 25 basis points of revenue growth, impact from each 1% change in pays per control. I think that gives you a very \u2013 we spent a lot of time pressure testing that assumption. I think Danny did a lot of work on it and I think that's a pretty solid way for you to look at things. So when you hear guidance from us about pays per control and you use that metric for your model, I think that's a much cleaner and easier way than to try to separate how many are furloughs versus how many are layoffs, et cetera, et cetera.\nKevin McVeigh: That's super helpful. And then I guess just a quick follow-up would be kind of coming out of this, obviously, in these type of events; you're really turn to in terms of the cavalry of the organization. Do you see any change competitively, particularly as obviously coming out of the last cycle much more service oriented as opposed to shift to the cloud in this one, but from a competitive perspective, any changes where you look to even build on that attrition number, longer term in terms of improvement?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think you do see some subtle differences in terms of company cultures and I think behavior. So as an example, one of the things that we have always, I think, trying to talk about is this willingness by us to really help our clients navigate through things, not just provide them the software solution. We actually took some responsibility for the outcomes of what they're trying to accomplish. And so the support we're providing around all these regulatory, I think is an example of that. That doesn't mean that other competitors aren't doing similar things.But as an example, some competitors would be more along the lines of providing tools online and directing clients to third parties or directing them to resources where they could get help versus in our case, we actually take the work on and we help our clients get to where they need to get in order to get their retention credit, tax credit, in order to get their payroll protection loan, in order to calculate in a few weeks or at least in a couple of months people are going to be needing help with calculating how to get forgiveness on those loans. I mean, there \u2013 this is a complicated environment by the way employment in general is always complicated. But this is a very complicated environment and having great tools and technology is incredibly important and we're totally committed to that. But I think it's undeniable that you also need extra help in these situations to help with questions and to help you navigate through the all the various regulatory hurdles.As an example, some of the legislation that was passed in the U.S., you have to really understand the interplay like, as an example, you can't take advantage of the deferral social security taxes and the payroll protection loans, but if you \u2013 you can take advantage of the social security deferrals up until you can get a loan, but then once it's forgiven, you can no longer defer your social security taxes. I mean those are things that are typically not well understood by our client base and I think just directing them to a website or to a tool, we don't think is really the \u2013 is the best way to help them.\nKevin McVeigh: That's awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Hope your families are all well. I wanted to try on outlook here. Just understanding the material uncertainty, can you help us frame some initial fiscal 2021 guide posts in trying to think how we should be thinking about next year based on some of the implied 4Q run rates? So, any sense of visibility you have across the businesses or maybe thinking across client size would be helpful. Thanks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: First of all, thanks for asking about our families. I hope yours is well also. Unfortunately, I mean it's a very fair question and I can understand why you're looking for any additional color. It's \u2013 as you can imagine, we struggled with even providing kind of fourth quarter metrics, because, two, three, four weeks ago, we had \u2013 or people had a certain view of how long \u201cthe issue is going to continue\u201d and when things were going to open up again. And then it got more negative and now it feels like it's gotten more positive. So I think that it's very difficult for us to go really beyond the fourth quarter in this environment.We have to remain optimistic that things are going to \u201cimprove\u201d but I think that we all have to take advantage of the time we have to wait and see how things play out, whether it's with the clients or with GDP or with the economy, or with these government programs, so that we can make more informed, I think, decisions about what 2021, I think, might look like. So I apologize for not being able to give you any additional color. But I think it would be a mistake to assume that the levels of activity that we've given you in the fourth quarter will continue into 2021, but it's also a mistake to assume that things are going to go back to normal at the beginning of 2021. And so we're going to keep an eye on the data and the information and do our best as we gather more information to give you a good view of what's going to happen in 2021 when we get there.\nKathleen Winters: Yes, maybe I could just add a few comments around the process and what we're doing in the data that we're looking at. Hence, while as Carlos said, we can't really give you the view right now or the exact guidepost, at least if you'll understand and know the process we're going that might help a little bit. So, look, things are, as Carlos said, it's extremely fluid right now. We're spending a lot of time studying and watching developments every single day and kind of looking at, I think about it in three steps if you will, in terms of first understanding what's happening from a pandemic standpoint and the epidemiology. Then understanding how that impacts the economy broadly around the world and then understanding how that impacts each of the business. So as we do that, obviously we're looking at numerous forecasts that I'm sure you all are looking at the same forecast that are being put out.But we're really spending a lot of time in parsing through those and kind of eliminating outliers and really utilizing the ones that we feel makes the most sense, and then applying that to you know, as I said, the implications for our business units and when you do that, as we've said largely PPC is going to be extremely significant driver for us. And then certainly the shape of the recovery from a new business booking standpoint will be critically important, so we're watching that as well as we see different regions and states kind of formulating and attempting the return to work.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. I appreciate that. Wanted on retention, the comments on the assumptions in 4Q, is the reduction wholly due to business closures. I'm curious if you're seeing any change in the competitive client loss.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, I think based on the comments we gave you about the third quarter and the year-to-date, I think we're doing pretty well competitively, because I think our retention was up. I mean we don't talk about quarterly retention, but why not like everything's out the window in this kind of environment. But I think we were over 50 basis points improvement in the third quarter and through the year-to-date. I think we were well ahead of both the guidance, we had provided in our own internal expectations. So it's pretty clear that we were doing something right competitively.Our NPS scores are at record levels across most of our businesses. So again, the problem is this is not the time to brag and talk about the third quarter, but we really had incredible momentum coming into the third quarter on a number of fronts, but that's that and we're onto now figuring out how to deal with the future challenges, but I have no concerns about the solidity of our business on every front coming into the third quarter.\nBryan Bergin: Thank you. Be well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKartik Mehta: Hi, good morning, Carlos. I was wondering, based on the data you're seeing and I realize this is so early in, but what kind of changes do you anticipate for the business, permanent changes or at least over the next 12 months to 18 months because of this current crisis?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, over the next 12 months to 18 months is probably the right focus, because I mean, I think it'd be naive to think there aren't some things are going to change permanently, but I'm not sure I have that, that kind of crystal ball to be precise about that. But for the next 12 months to 18 months, because of the focus we have on our associates, it's unlikely that we will be going back to business as usual here in the next few months.Now the good news is we've adapted to the current work environment. So, but \u2013 I kind of concrete change in terms of the next 12 months, 18 months is we don't anticipate having a 100% of our workforce back working in these one locations and some of these other places where we have large populations of associates. And so that's a change that we have to make sure that we stay on top of, that we support our people and lead them remotely and virtually and help them kind of navigate through what's a very different way of working.Now obviously we plan on, as society kind of normalizes, we plan on coming along for the ride with us. So we do a lot of formulating plans as we speak, very preliminary plans around how do we slowly get back into some of our offices with limited number of personnel, but that's a change that we're definitely going to have to continue to live with for the next 12 months to 18 months. Now, what that means is that impacts our salesforce and so the question is, if the demand equation improves significantly and our salesforce is still working remotely, how can we make sure that they have the right tools and the right processes to continue to take advantage of the demand that's out there.Because we don't anticipate having large numbers of salespeople back in our offices, our salespeople, by definition, many of them are inside sales, but many of them are out in face-to-face transactions. And that's not something that's going to normalize in the next 12 months to 18 months. Sadly, I'm sad to report that of the number of associates that we had impacted by COVID-19, we were disproportionately impacted in our salesforce. So as we go back to normalization, we're going to be exceptionally careful about protecting our salesforce as well.\nKartik Mehta: And then just finally, Carlos, what do you think the recovery will look like, we've heard so much a V, a U, a L, I'm just interested in your perspective of what you're anticipating from a recovery?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well I think the \u2013 again, we're looking at, we get information from all of the usual places like Morgan Stanley is obviously our banks, so they've been very helpful in getting us their information, but we have access to information from a number of other sources. I don't want to say any of the names, so I don't hurt anybody's feelings, but all the usual banks we get the information from them. We have information from Moody's, by the way we also work with the fed. We work with treasury. We have a lot of sources of information to give us some sense of kind of where things are headed.The challenges that I don't think anyone has really well \u2013 I don't think, I know that no one has ever been through this. So there really aren't any great models other than using inputs like PMIs or consumer confidence and other metrics that tend to be many of the metrics that people use in these models are lagging indicators.And you have regression that gives you some sense of where the economy is headed. But, as I\u2019ve seen myself in the last four to five weeks, you have to take any forecasts with a large grain of salt. So the best approach we think you can have right now is to remain flexible and agile about how you're planning and what you're planning for. If I were \u2013 if we had to make a bet today, we would say that, it's not going to be a V-shaped recovery and it's probably not going to be a U or an L, but it's going to be some other kind of shape where we obviously already had the precipitous decline. We\u2019ve already seen some signs of some stabilization. So we have metrics that we track like in our HR systems of our clients.For example, new job postings or number of screenings that are done, like background checks and some of those metrics have actually begun to stabilize. So I think we've had the abrupt drop. Now the question is the recovery, it feels like that recovery will be not a V, but not an L. And so the difference between V and L is a check Mark. Like I think some people are out there quoting, by the way we have an economist on our board and he referred to as a Nike Swoosh, but that's probably a copyright or trademark violation. So I won't use the Nike Swoosh, but you get the idea of rough drop and hopefully a climb back up over some period of time. Hopefully that client is over the course of three to six months and not over the course of 12 months to 18 months.\nKartik Mehta: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.\nDavid Grossman: Alright, thank you. Good morning. Carlos, I think you've addressed this in a couple of previous questions, but based on how this may play out coming out of the crisis and you talked just a moment ago about some possible structural changes at least in the intermediate term being work from home or virtual sales. How do you feel the way you're positioned, coming out of that versus where you were going into it and how do you view your ability to leverage that to your advantage? Is it structural or is it based on execution, I'm sure it's a combination of both, but if you could just give us a little more insight into how you're feeling about, what you can do with this crisis to really enhance your position both competitively and operationally.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, look I think that some of this is philosophical. I think that I like everyone else when we were entering this space I was scared like everyone else's, not just personally for myself and my family, but also for the company and all of our associates and our clients that depend on us.And when you see the reaction and the ability of the organization to kind of get through it and not just get through it, but actually deliver a higher level of service and help with very complicated questions in a very complicated situation, which was changing in some cases on a daily basis with the regulatory landscape. I think it tells you something about the strength of the culture and of the company. And so that gives me, again, this is all intellectual philosophical, but I think it gives me great hope about how we emerge from this competitively.We already had incredibly strong momentum going in to the third quarter, as you saw from retention we think we have a strong product lineup that was beginning to get traction. One of the things we didn't talk about when someone asked the question about our competitive situation, like we had really good growth in client counts, particularly in Workforce Now and specifically in our mid-market business. So the combination of positive momentum and coming into this and then the reaction and the strength of the organization through this gives me great optimism and hope that we're going to come out of this stronger than any of our competitors.\nKathleen Winters: Yes. Let me just add to that \u2013 Yes, I would just add to that, in addition to the great service that we've been able to provide to our clients throughout this, which theoretically ideally should sustain or drive even better retention going-forward. I would say the strength of our balance sheet and the ability to continue to invest aligned with what we laid out at our Innovation Day for investing in our strategic products and Workforce Now and RUN and our next gen product, our ability to continue to do that throughout this should position us well.\nDavid Grossman: Okay. That's it for me. Thanks very much. And be well.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.\nSteven Wald: Yes. Good morning. I hope you guys are safe and well, and thanks for the shout out from Morgan Stanley, a little bit around that subject. Maybe just starting off on some of the puts and takes of the segments, that you guys pointed to work site employee growth, still NPO versus lower pays per control and Employer Services just maybe run us through again because it's come up a lot in recent conversations around why the PEO should still be thought of as a employment-wise a little bit more defensive and how you guys see that tracking this downturn versus prior ones.\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think the number one reason is really just structural in the sense that when you look at overall ADP, we have clients all the way from a single employee all the way to very large national accounts. And so as we've said \u2013 we said this obviously over multiple decades, our down market business tends to be the most sensitive to other business but also to decreases in pays per control. And so as we track this pays per control data, I think we've probably given you some of the color that the pays per control numbers are down more in the down market than they are in the mid and the up market.The PEO, at least in our case, the PEO tends to \u2013 the average sized client, just from a practical standpoint is 45 and we tend to \u2013 we try to stay away from clients that are under 10 employees. We have some clients obviously that are between five and 10 employees, but in general, the sweet spot of the PEO is kind of around 45, that's the average. And so it's just the nature of the structural difference of that business versus the others that the pays per control is not going to decline as much as the overall average, if you will, where you have some of that average being in the small business and in the small business market.And then the second more anecdotal comment would be the PEO clients. Our PEO clients, not every PEO clients, our PEO clients tend to provide health benefits or retirement plan, they tend to be kind of higher average wages in the average U.S. worker. And that makes sense because you're paying for the help that you get with maximizing and managing that Salesforce. So it tends to be attractive to a higher average wage employer that is very concerned with attracting the right people and retaining the right people. So that also tends to lead you in the direction of clients that are a little bit larger, maybe a little bit more financially capable of paying those fees, et cetera. So that \u2013 but that not \u2013 not sure that we can have a scientific way of proving that one, but for sure the average size client of a PEO, our PEO is larger than in our SBS business and hence the pays per control drop would logically be smaller.\nSteven Wald: Got it. That's very helpful color. In terms of just a quick follow-up on capital management dividend, I know, both of you have mentioned the strength of the balance sheet, continued ongoing investment and cost cutting. But in terms of how we should think about things like the dividend and the safety there or your willingness to raise that, given the current environment or buybacks and other forms of acquisition that lower valuations, how are you guys thinking about that from a financial but also a strategic and sort of, I guess sensitivity to the times type of perspective.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Okay. So I'm glad you asked that question, as I happened to talk to our Chairman yesterday, before this call because I figured somebody might ask that question. It's a tricky question because as you know, it's up to the board to decide on our dividend, but I can tell you this, that we had a board meeting on April 8, and the board approved an increase and a payment of our dividend. And they wouldn't have done that if they had concerns in the short or medium-term about our capital position or about our dividends.So again, without speaking for the board, I think we have a very long 45 year track record of paying and increasing our dividend. We have a strong balance sheet. We are a capital light business with strong cash generation. Our payout ratio is 55% to 60%, which I think gives us some room to be able to continue even with increases without running into any major capital constraints or restrictions on our investing. So I would feel optimistic that our board would be supportive of continuing the long track record. ADP has of 45 years as it stands. And I'll let Kathleen maybe make a comment or two about that as well.\nKathleen Winters: Yes, thank you. You covered it really well for us, I would just say in support of enabling the board to make dividend decisions, we in a normal basis do ongoing analysis and stress testing and have been continuing to do that through this environment. So we've been doing, looking really closely at that stress testing. So, I really don't have anything to add beyond what Carlos commented.\nSteven Wald: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. And that's from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Thank you. Thank you for squeezing me in and great to hear everybody's voices. Glad to hear you're well. Just a little bit of a follow-up on the PEO question. I mean, as you just highlighted the work site employees in PEO are a bit more resilient, because of the larger size of company, but the revenue guidance there is down more significantly in Q4, maybe like a tactical question just around what drives that in the short-term, but maybe a broader question, Carlos, for you coming from originally the PEO business, how should we think about how the PEO will act through a recession period? Do you expect increased demand for the PEO or some clients dropping out of the PEO? How do you think about that dynamic? Thank you.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Great question, I'll let Danny pull up the calculator too, because I'm sure you're right about the dropping greater, there\u2019s no intention, there's no signaling or anything intended there, maybe rounding or the math or something. But there's no magic formula there that we're trying to send some kind of message. I mean, we think the PEO business is solid and strong and I think tends to whether recession is better. Again, every time you have a recession, it's a different kind of recession. So we had a financial crisis last time, this time it's a health crisis. So I'm always cautious of making kind of bold definitive statements. But historically we've always worried about the PEO going into a recession or into a crisis being challenged, because it does tend to be a kind of a more expensive, if you will \u2013 solution, if you will, but it also provides an enrollment with higher amount of value, and during these types of situations, like for example, our PEO handles the questions not just of our clients, but of the employees of our clients.That's not what we generally do for our typical payroll. That helps our clients a lot and we leave them of a big burden and provide those employees a lot of confidences, a lot of real positives and good reasons why people want to stay on a PEO or why they want to be on a PEO even in a recessionary environment. So I would say that, in the prior recessions, the PEO was not immune, just like it's not this time from pays per control decreases and from some short-term disruptions with new bookings. But we've been impressed, I've been through now, I guess this is my third recession at ADP and at least the prior to the PEO performed on a relative basis as well, if not better than the rest of our business. And we would expect no different on a go forward basis.\nDanyal Hussain: And Lisa, this is Danny just to add, because it's fairly in the weeds, which I love of course, but in addition to the impact from work site employees in the PEO we charge as a percent of payroll and so wages themselves, to the extent we have some workers working fewer hours within the PEO base that can have an impact and then even further in the weeds is, you can have a slight mix impact with respect to workers' comp. To the extent that certain industries have greater impact from pays per control and those had higher workers comp rate. So these are very subtle impacts, but together they\u2019re kind of informed that guidance.\nLisa Ellis: Wonderful. Thank you. And then maybe my last one and Carlos, could you one to end on, as you're watching and maybe help us a little bit, what are the top, like literally one or two things that you are watching that you think are really going to impact as you're looking at your client base, the shape of the swoosh or the check mark are over these next couple of months?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think the first one that we're keeping our eye on is really these leading indicators, if you will. So this would be job postings and background checks. And so that I think is \u2013 those are I think the job postings is obvious in the sense that people aren't really going to post new positions if they think that things are not going to at some point improve. So to me, that's a sign that people are doing the same thing we're doing, which is we're conservative and we're cautious, but we have to be prepared for every eventuality in including the optimistic one.And so this increase in postings, job postings to me means that people are starting to think of, well, if in two, three, four weeks this state or this industry has some kind of opening, I need to make sure that I have the people available to handle that work, because these are business owners that obviously have to run their businesses.And then secondly, when they actually do that, then they actually have to put that person through the new hiring process which is the screening and selection. And so we're going to keep an eye on those two figures. Then closely behind that, I think is a \u2013 we have a very large workforce management business or some people would call time and attendance. And so that is also data that is very helpful in terms of seeing number of hours worked. It doesn\u2019t always help you a lot with an exempt workforce, but for people who are paid hourly, it's a very good indicator that kind of cuts through the noise of furloughs and layoffs and so forth and so on, just kind of gives you some sense of \u201chours worked and whether that is increasing or not increasing\u201d so that should show an upturn before we see upturns in other things, because people will take the existing people they have now and just have them work longer hours rather than adding additional people. So the addition of people will probably be the final I think sign of a of recovery, but we have a number of other indicators that we can look at that gives us an earlier view of where we're headed.\nLisa Ellis: Wonderful, thanks guys.\nOperator: That concludes our question and answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: So it's hard to kind of find the words to close the call out and describe the situation that we're in. But trying to end on an optimistic note here, I've been now with ADP 20 years. And I've been through, I just mentioned two recessions, this is my third, been through Y2K, which most of the people on the call don't even remember. Danny, certainly doesn't remember Y2K, he was too young, through 9/11, we'd been through wars, we've been through multiple changes in technology, nobody was even talking about SaaS when I joined ADP. And every time we had a challenge it looked like that was a challenge that we couldn't overcome.But every time ADP overcame that challenge and it's no different, I think for the rest of \u2013 in this case, humanity because this is affecting not just the U.S. but it's affecting the entire world. People in ADP find a way to evolve and to adapt. So I have to be optimistic, we have a propensity to overcome. If not, we wouldn't be here talking to you today, whether it's us as human beings or us as a company. By the way, as I've said multiple times in other calls, we're 70 years old and I think as a company, and I think that tells you something, we're a part of a very long history of overcoming challenges and this one is going to be no different.And I'll leave you with something that I shared with our associates at the beginning of the crisis, which is something that our Founder, Henry Taub, I think established as a culture for the company that I think is appropriate. And he always told us and he told me because I knew him personally, he told me always take care of your associates and they will take care of your clients and everything else will take care of itself.So I really appreciate the support of all of you for ADP. Thank you for calling in and asking your questions and my best wishes to all of you for health and safety for you and your families. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Kathleen Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Carlos and good morning everyone. As Carlos mentioned, we were generally pleased with our execution in Q3 and our financial results were not significantly impacted by COVID-19, with the exception of New Business Bookings. We expect Q4, however, to be challenging on a few fronts. And I will cover this when I go through our guidance.This quarter\u2019s revenue growth of 6% reported and organic constant currency was in line with our expectations. Our adjusted EBIT margin was up 60 basis points compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, even though it included a $50 million cost of a global associate assistance payment related to COVID-19 which we disclosed in an 8-K several weeks ago. Excluding this, our margin performance was even further ahead of our expectations and continued to benefit from a combination of cost savings related to our transformation initiatives and operating efficiencies, as well as lower than expected incentive compensation expenses. These benefits were partially offset by growth in PEO zero-margin benefits pass-through expenses and amortization expense, as well as certain other expenses related to COVID-19. Our adjusted effective tax rate increased 30 basis points to 23.8% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2019, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.92 driven by revenue growth and margin expansion, as well as fewer shares outstanding compared to a year ago.Moving on to segment results. In our Employer Services Segment, revenues grew 3% reported and 4% organic constant currency, reflecting steady underlying performance with strong retention trends offset by continued FX pressure and a growing headwind from interest income. Interest income on client funds declined 5%, and average yield on client funds declined 20 basis points to 2% offsetting growth in average client funds balances of 4% to $31.3 billion. This growth in balances was driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control in the quarter, partially offset by lower SUI collections and the closure of our Netherlands money movement operation earlier this year. Our Employer Services same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. was 1.9% for the third quarter and I\u2019ll talk a bit more about the trends we\u2019re seeing in a moment. Employer Services margins increased 100 basis points in the quarter, ahead of expectations and driven by many of the same factors I mentioned earlier when discussing our consolidated results.Our PEO segment revenues grew 11% for the quarter to $1.2 billion, and average worksite employees grew 7% to $595,000 ahead of our expectations and driven by strong year-to-date new business bookings. We were pleased with this re-acceleration in our Worksite Employee growth in the third quarter and believe we would have been positioned for further acceleration exiting the year if not for COVID-19. Revenues excluding zero margin benefits pass-through grew 9% to $490 million and continue to include pressure from lower workers' compensation and SUI costs and related pricing. PEO margin expanded 10 basis points in the quarter in-line with our expectations.Let me now turn to our outlook for the remainder of the year. I'll start by discussing some of the specific macro driven factors that affect our financial performance. I'll caveat by saying that we're clearly operating in an evolving and uncertain situation and we're using data currently available to us to make reasonable assumptions on which we are basing our guidance.First out-of-business losses, we expect our retention to be impacted by elevated out-of-business losses in Q4 and although the federal government is providing stimulus to help companies continue operating, we're seeing clear strain on our client base and have observed certain leading indicators; such as companies going inactive and no running payroll, many of whom will restart their operations at some point, but some of whom we expect will not. Based on our experience with these leading indicators, we are building in an expectation for additional losses in our fourth quarter outlook and as a result we're lowering our full-year retention guidance to be down 30 basis points to 50 basis points despite running ahead of our expectations on a year-to-date basis.Next, pays per control. We exited March with negative pays per control growth and in April it deteriorated to a double-digit decline. We were assuming a 2% to 2.5% pays per control decline for the full year, which implies a mid-teens decline for Q4. As a reminder of how this affects us, we have varied contracts throughout our businesses that blend base fees and per employee fees and we also often utilize shared pricing and have certain annual revenues that are not as affected. As a result with our current mix of business, the direct revenue impact we expect to see is about 25 basis points in ES revenue growth for every 1% change in PPC. Some of our businesses are more sensitive to pays per control than others and so the precise neck that pays per control by business can drive the actual revenue impact higher or lower in any given period. This direct impact also doesn't include the impact from our volume based businesses like recruiting or payment cards.Finally, on client funds balances, through the combination of a challenging sales environment and anticipated increase in out of business losses, a decline in pays per control and potential decline in wages and hours worked we expect to see pressure in our balances in the near-term. Furthermore, the CARES Act has a provision that allows companies to defer the payment of the employer portion of payroll taxes, which represents less than 5% of our average client funds balance. But depending on the actual take rate of that provision, we could see further pressure on our balance growth. As a result of all these factors, we now expect 1% balance growth for the full year, which implies a low double-digit decline in the fourth quarter. To adjust the size of our client's fund investments to match expected changes in average client payroll and tax volumes.Beginning in March, we halted all new reinvestment of maturity in our client long and extended portfolios. And in April we took the additional step of selling approximately $1.2 billion of previously purchased securities in the client long and extended portfolios. This decision to suspend new purchases means our Q4 interest income forecast reflects a slightly greater skew to overnight rates than previously forecasted. Both the suspension of new purchases and the completed sale of securities is contemplated in our guidance. To be clear, these decisions represent tactical adjustments and do not represent a change to our overall client funds strategy.Let's now turn to our revised outlook for the full year and start with the ES segments. We are lowering our guidance to 1% to 2% revenue growth versus our prior outlook of 4%, driven mainly by an expectation of lower paid per control, new business booking, client fund interest and retention versus our prior outlook. Much of this lost revenue comes at high incremental margins and as a result and also due to additional costs related to COVID-19 we now expect our margin in the employer services segment to be down 25 to up 25 basis points.For our PEO, we saw good momentum up through the end of March and as I mentioned earlier, we believe we were on track for continued acceleration exiting the year, but are now layering in our expectation for layoffs and furloughs and additional out of business losses. As a reminder in our PEO segment, we earn revenues as a percent of the gross payroll we process and as a result we are more directly tied to changes in our client's head count and hours worked as compared to our employer services segment. As a result of these assumptions and our expectations for lower Q4 PEO sales, we are lowering our average work site employee growth expectations to 3% to 5% from 7% to 8% previously. We are likewise lowering our revenue guidance and now expect 5% to 7% PEO revenue growth in fiscal 2020 and 3% to 5% growth in PEO revenues excluding zero margin benefits pass-through.As we also discussed throughout the year, we continue to expect lower workers' compensation and SUI costs and related pricing to pressure our total PEO revenue growth. Though we could see those trends change in the coming years. For PEO margin, we now expect to be down 100 basis points to 125 basis points in fiscal 2020. As we noted in previous calls, this outlook continues include pressure from smaller favorable reserve adjustment that ADP Indemnity in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019, but we now expect about 75 basis points of pressure compared to our previous expectation of 50 basis points of pressure. So we still expect a slight benefit this year.With these changes to the segment, we now anticipate total revenue growth of about 3% in fiscal 2020 as compared to our previous outlook of 6%. This revenue outlook continues to assume slight FX unfavorability for fiscal 2020. As I mentioned, we anticipate our growth in average client funds balances to be about 1% compared to our previous outlook of 4% and we expect the average yield earn on our client funds investments to be about 2.1% compared to our previous outlook of 2.2%. We expect interest income on client funds to be $540 million to $550 million and for interest income from our extended investment strategy to be $550 million to $560 million.We anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to be down 25 to up 25 basis points, as the benefits from our workforce optimization and procurement transformation initiatives are now being offset by the impact of expected loss of revenue due to COVID-19 as well as incremental expenses related to COVID-19 including the [$50] [ph million in global associate assistance payments.We now anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 22.9%. The rate includes this quarters unplanned tax benefit from stock based compensation related to stock option exercises. It does not include any further estimated tax benefits related to potential future stock option exercises. As a result of our lower revenue and margin outlook, we now expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 4% to 7% in fiscal 2020. In light of this revised 2020 guidance and multiple headwinds created by the global pandemic and the uncertain and evolving situation we are withdrawing the fiscal 2021 targets that we set out at our 2018 Investor Day as they are no longer appropriate to the current circumstances. However, we continue to believe in our long-term strategy and well positioned to continue to invest to execute this strategy.Finally, before I conclude, I'd like to talk about the strength of ADP\u2019s business model and balance sheet. We have a highly cash generative business with low capital and the HCM Solutions we provide give critical support to our clients, HR and management functions, especially at times like these. In addition to having a resilient product and business model we also have a significant buffer between our free cash flow and our modest debt obligations and our cash to spend, this enables us to absorb the impact of downturns and continue to prioritize investments aligned with our longer term strategy as well as our commitments to shareholder friendly actions.So although our revenue growth can clearly be impacted by challenging macro conditions, our recurring revenue model and high retention rate positions us to continue the type of investments we highlighted at our innovation day even when times are tough. We will meanwhile continue to manage our cost base prudently. We have instituted hiring containment and started to execute on our recession playbook with a preplanned set of areas where we will see some of our expenses self-adjust, such as management and sales incentives and we will eliminate or defer non-essential staff. We're working through an evolving and uncertain situation and are formulating our approach for next year and we will of course provide you with our expectations and outlook for fiscal 2021 when we report our fourth quarter results. As always, expect us to be balanced in our approach.With that, I will pass it back to Carlos for some comments before we go to Q&A. And I think if I could just, yes, if I could just add to that. I think you had asked about, I couldn't quite hear, but I think you had asked about Lifion and any updates to that and changes to our view on go-to-market. I would say over the longer term, while certainly this year looks like things have slowed down at least for a little bit, I'd say over the long-term, no change to how we're thinking about that. And we're got a handful of live clients. We're continuing to sell clients on and implement clients on Lifion, and we're encouraged about the long-term prospects there. So, Tien-Tsin if I could just \u2013 let me just add a little bit more to that because I made some comments on our transformation efforts and transformation work even with the significant increase in service demand. So, even with this kind of very abrupt disruption and need to move our entire \u2013 practically our entire workforce to work from home. We will able to do that almost seamlessly. I mean, that worked really well through the huge, huge efforts of many of the different parts of the organization, from our technology groups to our HR to legal. I mean, it was a huge effort, but it worked well and so that we've been able to continue our normal processes, if you will around transformation work. There were certainly some projects that we have to look at and assess and say, okay, because of the big service demands we may need to slow down these.But our process in terms of tracking progress, continuing to execute, adjusting as necessary based on service demands and importantly continuing to look at pipeline of projects, that continue and I would just add one further comment that in particular in this environment, the ability to look at procurement and find procurement opportunities is potentially even greater today than it was, say three or four months ago. Yes, maybe I could just add a few comments around the process and what we're doing in the data that we're looking at. Hence, while as Carlos said, we can't really give you the view right now or the exact guidepost, at least if you'll understand and know the process we're going that might help a little bit. So, look, things are, as Carlos said, it's extremely fluid right now. We're spending a lot of time studying and watching developments every single day and kind of looking at, I think about it in three steps if you will, in terms of first understanding what's happening from a pandemic standpoint and the epidemiology. Then understanding how that impacts the economy broadly around the world and then understanding how that impacts each of the business. So as we do that, obviously we're looking at numerous forecasts that I'm sure you all are looking at the same forecast that are being put out.But we're really spending a lot of time in parsing through those and kind of eliminating outliers and really utilizing the ones that we feel makes the most sense, and then applying that to you know, as I said, the implications for our business units and when you do that, as we've said largely PPC is going to be extremely significant driver for us. And then certainly the shape of the recovery from a new business booking standpoint will be critically important, so we're watching that as well as we see different regions and states kind of formulating and attempting the return to work. Yes. Let me just add to that \u2013 Yes, I would just add to that, in addition to the great service that we've been able to provide to our clients throughout this, which theoretically ideally should sustain or drive even better retention going-forward. I would say the strength of our balance sheet and the ability to continue to invest aligned with what we laid out at our Innovation Day for investing in our strategic products and Workforce Now and RUN and our next gen product, our ability to continue to do that throughout this should position us well. Yes, thank you. You covered it really well for us, I would just say in support of enabling the board to make dividend decisions, we in a normal basis do ongoing analysis and stress testing and have been continuing to do that through this environment. So we've been doing, looking really closely at that stress testing. So, I really don't have anything to add beyond what Carlos commented."

            "name": "Carlos Rodriguez",
            "content": "Thank you, Danny and thank everyone for joining our call. Before we can, I want to first say that our thoughts and prayers are with those who have been or know someone who has been impacted by COVID-19. Every day we hear about how much of a challenge it has been for employers and workers alike, including our own.I'd like to recognize our associates for rising to the challenge and delivering exceptional service to our clients despite the extraordinary circumstances they've had to face. To them, I want to say thank you. For our discussion today, we'll spend a little less time talking about the third quarter and more time on the current operating climate. And I'd like to offer a couple of upfront points.First is that ADP is not immune to the global pandemics impact on the labor market, but while we may make tactical adjustments as we navigate through this crisis, we believe our long-term strategy is unaffected and we remain optimistic about how we're positioned over the coming years, once the business environment and our clients return to more normal operations. The second point is that we will continue to serve our clients in the way we know best, by offering the tools, resources, and support they need to manage their business and their workforce through all types of operating environments, including this challenging one.With that said, this morning we reported our third quarter fiscal 2020 results with revenue of $4 billion up 6% reported and organic constant currency and in line with our expectations. We expanded our adjusted EBIT margin by 60 basis points in the quarter, which was ahead of our expectations, even though it included an unplanned [$50] [ph] million global associate assistance payment in response to COVID-19. And with the solid revenue and margin performance, we were pleased to deliver 8% adjusted diluted EPS growth, which was also a slightly ahead of our expectations coming into the quarter.Turning now to the current situation, I'd like to take a few minutes to go deeper on how COVID-19 has affected our operations and what we've done to respond. As the situation evolved over the past couple of months, we focused first on the safety of our associates. In March, we took steps to quickly shift over 50,000 of our associates to work from home and now have approximately 98% of our workforce working remotely in a secure manner. In doing so, we leveraged our previous investments in business resiliency and in addition we ordered thousands of laptops, expanded remote access capacity, provided at home internet and for those critical personnel that needed to work onsite, we took steps to ensure their safety while they perform those essential onsite tasks. This was a huge undertaking by our global IT, security and legal, and HR organizations and I'm extremely proud of their execution.We also worked with our critical third-party service providers to ensure they were positioned to continue to support us. In March, we also had our field sales force shifts from in-person to a virtual sales model, and while that's not an ideal circumstance for some of our quota carriers, they're making the most of the situation. While we were executing on these business resiliency plans, we also worked nonstop to address our client's needs to ensure uninterrupted service across our HCM solutions. We provide a mission critical service and process payroll for one in six Americans and over 40 million workers around the world, and to offer immediate support we\u2019ve provided a number of online resources including an employer preparedness toolkit and webinars attended by tens of thousands of clients. We also quickly made available for free the payroll costs and headcount reports necessary to apply for forgivable loans under the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act and these reports have been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times.Service is more important than ever in times like this. We saw call volumes increased significantly beginning in March and have nearly 2 million inbound requests across our service channels in a matter of weeks, with clients looking for help with a variety of issues including adding custom pay codes related to COVID-19, redirecting checks to different locations and requesting new time tracking hardware that doesn't require physical contact. In many cases they were simply seeking general guidance in understanding new legislation. To meet our client's needs we retrained and quickly redeployed hundreds of associates to where they were needed most. And our service and IT teams worked quickly to digest and translate new legislation from the many jurisdictions around the world into our global payroll, time and attendance and other systems in a short period of time to allow our clients to comply with and benefit from these changes in legislation.As the environment for companies continues to evolve, whether due to legislative changes or operational realities, we at ADP are committed to supporting our clients to help them best navigate those changes. As we communicated in an open letter to U.S. policy leaders, ADP stands ready to facilitate current and future initiative that provides support to our clients and their workers. And in support of our local communities, ADP has made over $2 million in donations to relief efforts, including a dedicated relief fund for ADP associates that needed assistance as well as donations of medical supplies for hospitals, food banks, and their workers.With all that said, the significant impact of COVID-19 is having on a broader economy, is in turn having an effect on our reported metrics, in a much more abrupt fashion as compared to previous macro economic slowdowns. You can see this in our Employer Services new business bookings metric. This quarter we reported a decrease of 9%, as we saw bookings declined significantly and rapidly in mid-March when we typically would have expected to close many deals for the quarter. These results were of course well below our expectations coming into the quarter and while some of our businesses performed slightly better than others in March, the weakness was generally broad-based as the health crisis is affecting companies of all sizes and regions including internationally.We believe the impact to bookings stems from two factors. First is the buying behavior of our clients and prospects. As with prior uncertain economic environments, our clients and prospects have become time and resource-constrained and are faced with reassessing their own operations to best ride out the impact of this health crisis. And although our products support mission-critical functions, making decisions about additional HCM services or making the decision to switch from another vendor to ADP can get put off to a later time. Even in circumstances where decisions have already been made, clients are understandably delaying implementation which can also cause us to adjust down the bookings we record. The general change in behavior is common in recessionary periods and we are certainly not surprised to see it this time. It's clearly happening in a more abrupt manner compared to what we've experienced in the past.Second, as I mentioned earlier, there have naturally been constraints that limited the activity of our salesforce. What we have been able to lean more heavily on an inside sales strategy and virtual interactions by our field sales force. There has still been a reduction in our salesforce productivity. Our sales organization is experienced and resilient and we will continue to work hard in the fourth quarter. Because of a variety of factors which we believe will have an outside impact on the fourth quarter booking, including the effectiveness of the Paycheck Protection Program in supporting small to mid-sized businesses and how quickly our clients can adapt to working in this new environment and resume more normal buying behavior, there is clearly a very wide range of outcomes.But to calibrate your expectations, we are guiding for a full year ES New Business Bookings, our ES New Business bookings to be down 20% which implies our fourth quarter bookings will be down by more than 50%. With all that said, we remain confident in our product portfolio and optimistic about our ability to drive sustained growth in ES bookings in a sounder economic environment.I now like to spend a minute or two on some of the other macro driven trends we've observed in our client base. Our pays per control metric, which represents employee growth for a broad subset of our client base was solid through February, but decelerated to a slight negative growth by the end of March, averaging 1.9% growth for the quarter. Early in April, we saw it deteriorate further to a double digit negative decline, with the steepest decline among smaller businesses. For context, this level of pays per controlled decline is significantly worse than even the worst quarter in the financial crisis, underscoring that it's hard to compare this environment even against the past recessions. While we hope that legislation aimed at preserving employment will drive a recovery in pays per control, we had not seen it through mid-April.On retention, we were actually pleased with our performance in the third quarter, with both third quarter and year-to-date retention performance better than our expectations and ahead of pays per our previous annual guidance. We set all time third quarter retention record in our down market and mid-market businesses, as client satisfaction scores were at or near all time highs and as the benefits of our technology and migration strategy over the past several years continue to bear fruit. But clearly, out-of-business losses are a concern for the fourth quarter and beyond. And although they have not yet meaningfully picked up by the end of March or even into April, early indicators of stress in our client base have shown up and we expect deterioration in retention in May and June.Kathleen will share some of the assumptions for the fourth quarter when she goes through the outlook. I'd like to pivot now from the current macro environment and focus on our strategy and what we're doing to drive longer term value for our clients.At ADP, we remained steadfast in our commitment to lead in the HCM industry with best-in-class technology and service. At our February, Innovation Day we shared an update with many of you about the innovation we are driving across our key strategic and next gen solutions. The HCM industry is an exciting place with constant change and we will continue to invest to position ourselves to meet the evolving needs of our clients over not just the coming years but the coming decade.At Innovation Day, we've covered several topics and I'd like to reframe a few of our key products against today's backdrop. With ADP RUN we help small businesses manage their essential HR tasks from basic payroll to a full HCM suite. We highlighted our push-to-drive digital sales and onboarding capabilities1 which is especially relevant in today's environment and we also highlighted innovations in automating service and implementation which relieves pressure on our service organization. We discussed Workforce Now and our public cloud native version that we are pairing with our next gen payroll engine, which utilizes a fully transparent policy-based model for improved implementation, maintenance and self service as well as continuous payroll calculations for clients looking for on-demand pay options.We also talked about Wisely and the ease of use and the financial tools that make an attractive \u2013attractive way to get paid. And just this month we made Wisely Direct available to our mid-market Workforce Now clients, which we believe will be beneficial to the many workers in our base that still get paid by a paper check. And of course we discussed our next gen HCM, which we believe represents a big step ahead of current offerings in the market and for which we remain excited about scaling and selling more broadly.Before I turn it over to Kathleen, I'd like to take a moment to once again thank our associates. This health crisis and the resulting economic fallout hasn't been easy on anyone, but our associates have really stepped up to ensure we continue to provide our clients with the support they need, and our clients and I appreciate it, Kathleen, I'll turn it over to you now. Thanks, Kathleen. Before we move on to the Q&A, I just wanted to share with you an excerpt of one of the many notes we received from our clients that that captures how we want to define ourselves. This one said, we are a small business that has used ADP for quite a few years now, every time we call there has been a knowledgeable professional at ADP that immediately solves the problem and answers the question.We recently needed payroll data to apply for the COVID-19 payroll protection program. I immediately went to ADPs website to see how I should go about selecting and downloading the required payroll data. Imagine the relief when opening the screen there was a COVID-19 pop-up that proactively provided your clients with the payroll data needed, I was floored. This type of customer service is unheard of these days. We just want to tip our hats to everyone ADP for a great job. As this client suggests, the value of a true HCM partner becomes even more critical at times like these. And it continues to be our goal to exceed the expectations of our clients.And with that I'll turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Great question, we're obviously keeping our eye on that. Unfortunately what we have is really kind of limited anecdotal evidence that people are beginning to get money to be able to continue their payroll, they continue to pay people. As an example, a few days ago I was forwarded a letter that was sent to \u2013 an email that was sent to one of our associates from a client that was grateful for kind of the help that we gave them in applying for the loan and they sent a kind of a screenshot of their bank account that had $10 the previous day and then now had $84,000, like indicating that they have gotten their money from the SBA deposited into their commercial bank account. But I think as you've heard same as us in the press, the process has been given the magnitude of the scale of the challenge it's been a difficult process both for the SBA and I think for the banks, we've tried to do our part to help and we're optimistic and we're hopeful that it will make a difference and that there will be rehiring and that it will at least in some respects stop the furloughing and the elimination of jobs going forward. But unfortunately it's just a little too early for us to give you any kind of concrete evidence other than some anecdotal stories that money is making its way into the bank accounts of small businesses. I mean, clearly we have to be nimble, and I think remain open to making further adjustments, but I think it's safe to say that if you go back over the course of decades, the concept of \u201coutsourcing\u201d and now what some people would call the SaaS models, which I think ADP was kind of one of the pioneers of, I think by definition, lend themselves to these kinds of remote work environments, whether it's for the technology people, because we generally obviously host and maintain and update the \u2013 all of the systems for our clients. But also through the variety of portals we have for our clients and the employees of our clients. All of the information that anyone needs is available online through all the tools we have to access that information, whether it's for the payroll practitioners or for the employees of our clients. Including, when you think about the app that we have for the employees of our clients to be able to check whether they've gotten paid, they can check their hours; they can make changes to 401(k). There's no really no need to move paper or for anyone to be in the office to do that kind of work. So clearly there will be things that we will learn and we'll probably hear in the early innings of this kind of new talent and how it might affect our products. But I think in general as an industry, it's not just for ADP, I think in general for us as an industry we're pretty well positioned I think for this kind of work environment. Yes. It's clear, like every time that we have, whether it's an economic downturn or now this is obviously a new challenge, there's always questions about, will this drive greater adoption? I think intellectually it makes sense that this would drive greater outsourcing and greater adoption of a SaaS, but it's kind of hard to make that statement kind of where we are today, but theoretically and intellectually two or three years from now, there should be more demand and more people using SaaS solutions than there are today. So we're trying to actually keep an eye on it week-to-week to get some sense of what levers there are still there. We clearly still have, our sales force is still selling and they're selling a lot of business, but at lower level than obviously we had expected and in lower levels and you compare it to the previous year. So unfortunately given the nature of the situation, it's kind of difficult to give you a kind of scientific or concrete answer. I think as we generate more information, I think probably for our guidance for next fiscal year, we'll be able to \u2013 I know that's not helpful to you today, but it's really a very difficult thing to talk about.We have a lot of, our salesforce was already what we call an inside salesforce and so we've proven that we can sell through insight selling, but we have some products that are what I would call high involvement decision sales. And it doesn't mean that those can't be done remotely. But it hasn't been the norm. So when you sell a very large complicated multinational solution, or frankly, even when you sell the PEO, historically there's been a relationship that's built there and a trust that gets built before that transaction gets consummated.So it clearly, this is \u2013 these are new and different times. So I don't think everyone is going to sit and wait around for everything to go back to normal before making decisions. But I think it's safe to assume, I think common sense would tell us that it's safe to assume that, there will be some level of hesitation and pull back in terms of decision making. Even though a good percentage of our salesforce is still outselling as they have before, although they're doing it virtually now. So we did have a number of transformation initiatives underway. A lot of them were really around digital transformation efforts to kind of automate and improve the way our implementation or our services is delivered, which would create a better experience for our clients, the employees of our clients, frankly also for our associates that we thought would result in lower costs going forward. Yes, part of the challenge we have is as and again, every company may be different in terms of how they approach their level of support for their clients, but based on our model and the way we see ourselves playing a role, and frankly in society and with our clients, we've actually experienced quite an increase in volume and cost in the short-term.And so as an example, as the government rolled out the payroll protection program, we saw 40% to 50% spikes in inquiries right through whether it's phone or chat or by or by email. And so we had to work people overtime. We had to work people on weekends, which we're very grateful that people were willing to do, because you can imagine they've got lots of other concerns and distractions as this is all going on. And so we made a commitment that we're going to deliver to our clients through this and help them work through it, whether it's for themselves or for their employees. And unfortunately, I would say in the short-term, we actually have an increase in cost.Now, realistically that's not going to continue indefinitely. But every week that we said we think our call volumes and our workloads are going to go down, there's a new government program or a change in the government program, which by the way we think is great. I think that the efforts by the Fed and by policy makers, I think to help clients and their employees, I think is the right thing to do and we're very supportive. But as an example, there was just, as you know, there was an approval of an additional amount for the payroll protection program, which generates additional volume for us. By the way, I think the banks are in the same \u2013 probably in the same situation in terms of how having to handle kind of increase the volumes. And so we expect these levels to normalize and then to be in a position where we can reevaluate our cost structure, but again, given the timing of this call and where we are today, we really can't tell you that there has been a meaningful decline in our workloads. In fact, it's actually been an increase. I think if I can just one more just comment, I think that the \u2013 the part of the challenge here is that we are \u2013 the nature of our company and our business and our Board is to not focus on one month or one quarter. And I think when you look at we're able to deliver just in this quarter in terms of margin improvement and we've been able to do in the last couple of years, I think demonstrates very clearly our ability to, I think achieve and take advantage of operating leverage and also to manage our cost very effectively.We've had a couple of years with a very modest, if any cost \u2013 true cost increases while revenues were growing at what for us is our very healthy rates. So I think we've demonstrated what we can, what we can do, but unfortunately we've been handed a very abrupt change here in the environment and we're going to handle it first to take care of our associates, next take care of our clients. And I think when we get through this transitory period, which we all know is transitory, now we don't know is a transitory for a month or two or is it transitory for six months. But either way it's not multiple years and we want to make sure that we continue to invest in our business, take care of our people and take care of our clients that when we come out of this, we come out of it as strong as we were before we went into it. It's a great, question. So we have, as you know we operate in multiple countries and offer multiple segments; small business, midsize national accounts, but also in many countries and also multinational companies. And the policies that companies have around how they treat employees is going to vary from company-to-company and generally also varies from segment-to-segment. But what we can tell you is that, the way we count pays per control is very straightforward. It's whether or not someone got paid during that period of time that we're counting. And so we would not probably be able to give you a firm number of how many people are furloughed versus how many people are laid-off because we don't control necessarily that coding in the system. And clients can exercise some discretion about how they, I guess tagged some of their employees.But what we do know is that if somebody doesn't get paid, they don't get counted in pays for control. And if they do get paid, even if it's at a reduced wage, that does count and so that creates a number of challenges obviously. Because you could have reduced wage levels, which then doesn't negatively impact pays per control, but impacts the employees themselves. And may in some cases, impact our fees generally wouldn't other than in the PEO, but could impact our fees as well.So I would say that the best thing to do is to stick to \u2013 trying to use the pays per control metric as a way of building your models and using the guidance that we provided around 25 basis points of revenue growth, impact from each 1% change in pays per control. I think that gives you a very \u2013 we spent a lot of time pressure testing that assumption. I think Danny did a lot of work on it and I think that's a pretty solid way for you to look at things. So when you hear guidance from us about pays per control and you use that metric for your model, I think that's a much cleaner and easier way than to try to separate how many are furloughs versus how many are layoffs, et cetera, et cetera. I think you do see some subtle differences in terms of company cultures and I think behavior. So as an example, one of the things that we have always, I think, trying to talk about is this willingness by us to really help our clients navigate through things, not just provide them the software solution. We actually took some responsibility for the outcomes of what they're trying to accomplish. And so the support we're providing around all these regulatory, I think is an example of that. That doesn't mean that other competitors aren't doing similar things.But as an example, some competitors would be more along the lines of providing tools online and directing clients to third parties or directing them to resources where they could get help versus in our case, we actually take the work on and we help our clients get to where they need to get in order to get their retention credit, tax credit, in order to get their payroll protection loan, in order to calculate in a few weeks or at least in a couple of months people are going to be needing help with calculating how to get forgiveness on those loans. I mean, there \u2013 this is a complicated environment by the way employment in general is always complicated. But this is a very complicated environment and having great tools and technology is incredibly important and we're totally committed to that. But I think it's undeniable that you also need extra help in these situations to help with questions and to help you navigate through the all the various regulatory hurdles.As an example, some of the legislation that was passed in the U.S., you have to really understand the interplay like, as an example, you can't take advantage of the deferral social security taxes and the payroll protection loans, but if you \u2013 you can take advantage of the social security deferrals up until you can get a loan, but then once it's forgiven, you can no longer defer your social security taxes. I mean those are things that are typically not well understood by our client base and I think just directing them to a website or to a tool, we don't think is really the \u2013 is the best way to help them. First of all, thanks for asking about our families. I hope yours is well also. Unfortunately, I mean it's a very fair question and I can understand why you're looking for any additional color. It's \u2013 as you can imagine, we struggled with even providing kind of fourth quarter metrics, because, two, three, four weeks ago, we had \u2013 or people had a certain view of how long \u201cthe issue is going to continue\u201d and when things were going to open up again. And then it got more negative and now it feels like it's gotten more positive. So I think that it's very difficult for us to go really beyond the fourth quarter in this environment.We have to remain optimistic that things are going to \u201cimprove\u201d but I think that we all have to take advantage of the time we have to wait and see how things play out, whether it's with the clients or with GDP or with the economy, or with these government programs, so that we can make more informed, I think, decisions about what 2021, I think, might look like. So I apologize for not being able to give you any additional color. But I think it would be a mistake to assume that the levels of activity that we've given you in the fourth quarter will continue into 2021, but it's also a mistake to assume that things are going to go back to normal at the beginning of 2021. And so we're going to keep an eye on the data and the information and do our best as we gather more information to give you a good view of what's going to happen in 2021 when we get there. Well, I think based on the comments we gave you about the third quarter and the year-to-date, I think we're doing pretty well competitively, because I think our retention was up. I mean we don't talk about quarterly retention, but why not like everything's out the window in this kind of environment. But I think we were over 50 basis points improvement in the third quarter and through the year-to-date. I think we were well ahead of both the guidance, we had provided in our own internal expectations. So it's pretty clear that we were doing something right competitively.Our NPS scores are at record levels across most of our businesses. So again, the problem is this is not the time to brag and talk about the third quarter, but we really had incredible momentum coming into the third quarter on a number of fronts, but that's that and we're onto now figuring out how to deal with the future challenges, but I have no concerns about the solidity of our business on every front coming into the third quarter. Well, over the next 12 months to 18 months is probably the right focus, because I mean, I think it'd be naive to think there aren't some things are going to change permanently, but I'm not sure I have that, that kind of crystal ball to be precise about that. But for the next 12 months to 18 months, because of the focus we have on our associates, it's unlikely that we will be going back to business as usual here in the next few months.Now the good news is we've adapted to the current work environment. So, but \u2013 I kind of concrete change in terms of the next 12 months, 18 months is we don't anticipate having a 100% of our workforce back working in these one locations and some of these other places where we have large populations of associates. And so that's a change that we have to make sure that we stay on top of, that we support our people and lead them remotely and virtually and help them kind of navigate through what's a very different way of working.Now obviously we plan on, as society kind of normalizes, we plan on coming along for the ride with us. So we do a lot of formulating plans as we speak, very preliminary plans around how do we slowly get back into some of our offices with limited number of personnel, but that's a change that we're definitely going to have to continue to live with for the next 12 months to 18 months. Now, what that means is that impacts our salesforce and so the question is, if the demand equation improves significantly and our salesforce is still working remotely, how can we make sure that they have the right tools and the right processes to continue to take advantage of the demand that's out there.Because we don't anticipate having large numbers of salespeople back in our offices, our salespeople, by definition, many of them are inside sales, but many of them are out in face-to-face transactions. And that's not something that's going to normalize in the next 12 months to 18 months. Sadly, I'm sad to report that of the number of associates that we had impacted by COVID-19, we were disproportionately impacted in our salesforce. So as we go back to normalization, we're going to be exceptionally careful about protecting our salesforce as well. Well I think the \u2013 again, we're looking at, we get information from all of the usual places like Morgan Stanley is obviously our banks, so they've been very helpful in getting us their information, but we have access to information from a number of other sources. I don't want to say any of the names, so I don't hurt anybody's feelings, but all the usual banks we get the information from them. We have information from Moody's, by the way we also work with the fed. We work with treasury. We have a lot of sources of information to give us some sense of kind of where things are headed.The challenges that I don't think anyone has really well \u2013 I don't think, I know that no one has ever been through this. So there really aren't any great models other than using inputs like PMIs or consumer confidence and other metrics that tend to be many of the metrics that people use in these models are lagging indicators.And you have regression that gives you some sense of where the economy is headed. But, as I\u2019ve seen myself in the last four to five weeks, you have to take any forecasts with a large grain of salt. So the best approach we think you can have right now is to remain flexible and agile about how you're planning and what you're planning for. If I were \u2013 if we had to make a bet today, we would say that, it's not going to be a V-shaped recovery and it's probably not going to be a U or an L, but it's going to be some other kind of shape where we obviously already had the precipitous decline. We\u2019ve already seen some signs of some stabilization. So we have metrics that we track like in our HR systems of our clients.For example, new job postings or number of screenings that are done, like background checks and some of those metrics have actually begun to stabilize. So I think we've had the abrupt drop. Now the question is the recovery, it feels like that recovery will be not a V, but not an L. And so the difference between V and L is a check Mark. Like I think some people are out there quoting, by the way we have an economist on our board and he referred to as a Nike Swoosh, but that's probably a copyright or trademark violation. So I won't use the Nike Swoosh, but you get the idea of rough drop and hopefully a climb back up over some period of time. Hopefully that client is over the course of three to six months and not over the course of 12 months to 18 months. Well, look I think that some of this is philosophical. I think that I like everyone else when we were entering this space I was scared like everyone else's, not just personally for myself and my family, but also for the company and all of our associates and our clients that depend on us.And when you see the reaction and the ability of the organization to kind of get through it and not just get through it, but actually deliver a higher level of service and help with very complicated questions in a very complicated situation, which was changing in some cases on a daily basis with the regulatory landscape. I think it tells you something about the strength of the culture and of the company. And so that gives me, again, this is all intellectual philosophical, but I think it gives me great hope about how we emerge from this competitively.We already had incredibly strong momentum going in to the third quarter, as you saw from retention we think we have a strong product lineup that was beginning to get traction. One of the things we didn't talk about when someone asked the question about our competitive situation, like we had really good growth in client counts, particularly in Workforce Now and specifically in our mid-market business. So the combination of positive momentum and coming into this and then the reaction and the strength of the organization through this gives me great optimism and hope that we're going to come out of this stronger than any of our competitors. Thank you. I think the number one reason is really just structural in the sense that when you look at overall ADP, we have clients all the way from a single employee all the way to very large national accounts. And so as we've said \u2013 we said this obviously over multiple decades, our down market business tends to be the most sensitive to other business but also to decreases in pays per control. And so as we track this pays per control data, I think we've probably given you some of the color that the pays per control numbers are down more in the down market than they are in the mid and the up market.The PEO, at least in our case, the PEO tends to \u2013 the average sized client, just from a practical standpoint is 45 and we tend to \u2013 we try to stay away from clients that are under 10 employees. We have some clients obviously that are between five and 10 employees, but in general, the sweet spot of the PEO is kind of around 45, that's the average. And so it's just the nature of the structural difference of that business versus the others that the pays per control is not going to decline as much as the overall average, if you will, where you have some of that average being in the small business and in the small business market.And then the second more anecdotal comment would be the PEO clients. Our PEO clients, not every PEO clients, our PEO clients tend to provide health benefits or retirement plan, they tend to be kind of higher average wages in the average U.S. worker. And that makes sense because you're paying for the help that you get with maximizing and managing that Salesforce. So it tends to be attractive to a higher average wage employer that is very concerned with attracting the right people and retaining the right people. So that also tends to lead you in the direction of clients that are a little bit larger, maybe a little bit more financially capable of paying those fees, et cetera. So that \u2013 but that not \u2013 not sure that we can have a scientific way of proving that one, but for sure the average size client of a PEO, our PEO is larger than in our SBS business and hence the pays per control drop would logically be smaller. Okay. So I'm glad you asked that question, as I happened to talk to our Chairman yesterday, before this call because I figured somebody might ask that question. It's a tricky question because as you know, it's up to the board to decide on our dividend, but I can tell you this, that we had a board meeting on April 8, and the board approved an increase and a payment of our dividend. And they wouldn't have done that if they had concerns in the short or medium-term about our capital position or about our dividends.So again, without speaking for the board, I think we have a very long 45 year track record of paying and increasing our dividend. We have a strong balance sheet. We are a capital light business with strong cash generation. Our payout ratio is 55% to 60%, which I think gives us some room to be able to continue even with increases without running into any major capital constraints or restrictions on our investing. So I would feel optimistic that our board would be supportive of continuing the long track record. ADP has of 45 years as it stands. And I'll let Kathleen maybe make a comment or two about that as well. Great question, I'll let Danny pull up the calculator too, because I'm sure you're right about the dropping greater, there\u2019s no intention, there's no signaling or anything intended there, maybe rounding or the math or something. But there's no magic formula there that we're trying to send some kind of message. I mean, we think the PEO business is solid and strong and I think tends to whether recession is better. Again, every time you have a recession, it's a different kind of recession. So we had a financial crisis last time, this time it's a health crisis. So I'm always cautious of making kind of bold definitive statements. But historically we've always worried about the PEO going into a recession or into a crisis being challenged, because it does tend to be a kind of a more expensive, if you will \u2013 solution, if you will, but it also provides an enrollment with higher amount of value, and during these types of situations, like for example, our PEO handles the questions not just of our clients, but of the employees of our clients.That's not what we generally do for our typical payroll. That helps our clients a lot and we leave them of a big burden and provide those employees a lot of confidences, a lot of real positives and good reasons why people want to stay on a PEO or why they want to be on a PEO even in a recessionary environment. So I would say that, in the prior recessions, the PEO was not immune, just like it's not this time from pays per control decreases and from some short-term disruptions with new bookings. But we've been impressed, I've been through now, I guess this is my third recession at ADP and at least the prior to the PEO performed on a relative basis as well, if not better than the rest of our business. And we would expect no different on a go forward basis. I think the first one that we're keeping our eye on is really these leading indicators, if you will. So this would be job postings and background checks. And so that I think is \u2013 those are I think the job postings is obvious in the sense that people aren't really going to post new positions if they think that things are not going to at some point improve. So to me, that's a sign that people are doing the same thing we're doing, which is we're conservative and we're cautious, but we have to be prepared for every eventuality in including the optimistic one.And so this increase in postings, job postings to me means that people are starting to think of, well, if in two, three, four weeks this state or this industry has some kind of opening, I need to make sure that I have the people available to handle that work, because these are business owners that obviously have to run their businesses.And then secondly, when they actually do that, then they actually have to put that person through the new hiring process which is the screening and selection. And so we're going to keep an eye on those two figures. Then closely behind that, I think is a \u2013 we have a very large workforce management business or some people would call time and attendance. And so that is also data that is very helpful in terms of seeing number of hours worked. It doesn\u2019t always help you a lot with an exempt workforce, but for people who are paid hourly, it's a very good indicator that kind of cuts through the noise of furloughs and layoffs and so forth and so on, just kind of gives you some sense of \u201chours worked and whether that is increasing or not increasing\u201d so that should show an upturn before we see upturns in other things, because people will take the existing people they have now and just have them work longer hours rather than adding additional people. So the addition of people will probably be the final I think sign of a of recovery, but we have a number of other indicators that we can look at that gives us an earlier view of where we're headed. So it's hard to kind of find the words to close the call out and describe the situation that we're in. But trying to end on an optimistic note here, I've been now with ADP 20 years. And I've been through, I just mentioned two recessions, this is my third, been through Y2K, which most of the people on the call don't even remember. Danny, certainly doesn't remember Y2K, he was too young, through 9/11, we'd been through wars, we've been through multiple changes in technology, nobody was even talking about SaaS when I joined ADP. And every time we had a challenge it looked like that was a challenge that we couldn't overcome.But every time ADP overcame that challenge and it's no different, I think for the rest of \u2013 in this case, humanity because this is affecting not just the U.S. but it's affecting the entire world. People in ADP find a way to evolve and to adapt. So I have to be optimistic, we have a propensity to overcome. If not, we wouldn't be here talking to you today, whether it's us as human beings or us as a company. By the way, as I've said multiple times in other calls, we're 70 years old and I think as a company, and I think that tells you something, we're a part of a very long history of overcoming challenges and this one is going to be no different.And I'll leave you with something that I shared with our associates at the beginning of the crisis, which is something that our Founder, Henry Taub, I think established as a culture for the company that I think is appropriate. And he always told us and he told me because I knew him personally, he told me always take care of your associates and they will take care of your clients and everything else will take care of itself.So I really appreciate the support of all of you for ADP. Thank you for calling in and asking your questions and my best wishes to all of you for health and safety for you and your families. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChristian Greyenbuhl: Thank you, Crystal, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining ADP\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call and webcast. With me today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer.Earlier this morning, we released our results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. The earnings materials are available on the SEC\u2019s Web site and our Investor Relations Web site at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segment.During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description and the timing of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measure can be found in our earnings release.Today\u2019s call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.Before I turn the call over to Carlos, I\u2019d like to remind you of our upcoming Innovation Day which is scheduled for February 10. We hope to see many of you there in person and for those who are unable to attend, you can find more details about how to view the event at investors.adp.com. We\u2019re looking forward to sharing our progress on our investments and innovation as well as our vision for our HCM technology portfolio. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions.And with that, let me turn the call over to Carlos.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you, Christian, and thank you everyone for joining our call. This morning, we reported our second quarter fiscal 2020 results with revenue of 3.7 billion for the quarter, up 5% reported and organic constant currency. We are pleased with this revenue growth, which was slightly ahead of our expectations.Our adjusted EBIT margin increased 70 basis points for the quarter and was also slightly ahead of our expectations. Together with share buybacks and a lower adjusted effective tax rate, these results helped us deliver 13% adjusted EPS growth in this quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our progress through the first half of fiscal 2020 following a difficult compare with the first half of fiscal 2019.Moving on to operations and starting with new business bookings. This quarter, we continue to see strength in our Employer Services downmarket offerings and solid progress on the sales of our Workforce Now solutions. We were also particularly pleased to see strong double-digit bookings growth in our PEO.With that said, we are disappointed with our 3% Employer Services new business bookings growth for the quarter. This lower than expected growth was mainly the result of the same trends we saw in the first quarter with our international and multinational businesses, including delayed decisions for some of our larger multinational sales opportunities.As we have said before, given their size, these opportunities can have an outsized impact on our quarterly booking metric. With this in mind, we have narrowed our full year Employer Services new business bookings outlook and now expect 6% to 7% growth as compared to our previous guidance of 6% to 8% growth on last year\u2019s 1.6 billion of Employer Services new business bookings. We continue to have a solid pipeline of opportunities and we remain confident in our ability to execute across our portfolio.Looking at client service, we continue to see good progress with overall strength in our net promoter scores and retention. As a result, we continue to expect our forecasted full year fiscal 2020 Employer Services revenue retention to increase 10 to 20 basis points.Now we\u2019re halfway to fiscal 2020 and at the midpoint of our three-year targets we outlined at our June 2018 Investor Day. As we are also six months away from giving our fiscal 2021 guidance and we will not be giving any updated financial outlook at our upcoming Innovation Day, I want to take a few moments here to look back and share my thoughts on our progress since we provided that guidance.Let\u2019s start with new business bookings. You will recall that our June 2018 Investor Day, we outlined that we were targeting growth for worldwide new business bookings growth of 7% to 9% through 2021. Though we no longer regularly report a worldwide bookings figure, which as a reminder includes the results of Employer Services and PEO segments together, we thought it would helpful in that context of a midpoint look back to share that we have seen 8% average quarter growth since the beginning of fiscal 2019.We are pleased with this worldwide bookings growth together with our improvements in Employer Services revenue retention and how they demonstrate the strength and stability of our business even as we\u2019ve been going through meaningful transformation as an organization with a set of broad-based initiatives, including our Service Alignment Initiative in fiscal years 2017 and '18, our Voluntary Early Retirement Program in fiscal 2019 and most recently our Workforce Optimization and Procurement initiatives.Meanwhile, our quarterly average consolidated revenue grew 6% reported and organic constant currency over the past 18 months. As we look at some of the developments that have affected our recent growth relative to our expectations, we note that our PEO has not performed in line with our long-term expectations driven by lower than expected pass-through revenues and lower than planned worksite employee growth.Over the past several quarters, we have discussed some of the factors impacting PEO revenue growth, including the impacts from our sales incentives, recent retention unfavorability related to healthcare inflation and softness in workers\u2019 compensation and state unemployment insurance rates.With the impact of these factors, our average growth over the past 18 months in average worksite employees was 8% as compared to our long-term expectation of 9% to 11%. And a contribution to revenue growth from pass-throughs was 1% compared to our long-term expectation of 1% to 3%.Despite the slight underperformance relative to our expectations, we are confident in the overall prospects of the PEO business and continue to see healthy demand for our offerings. Our PEO platform is the leading fully outsourced solution in the HCM market and we combine this with best-in-class HR business partners, which together helps deliver an unparalleled service experience.Stepping back now to total revenue, we are tracking at 6% average growth through six quarters. We have a solid playbook with a proven track record of driving sustained growth and we\u2019ll continue to focus on delivering consistent strong bookings growth and retention performance as key priorities.And moving down the P&L, during this period we further solidified the foundations of our business as our associates continue to transform the way we work while also delivering innovative solutions to our clients.These transformation efforts along with our steady top line growth and the operating leverage in our model have helped deliver robust margin expansion and an average adjusted EBIT growth of 13% through the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020, which is within the range of our fiscal 2021 target CAGR of 12.5% to 15.5%.This together with our disciplined share buybacks and a lower adjusted effective tax rate has driven adjusted EPS growth of 18%, which is tracking ahead of our targeted growth of 14.5% to 17.5% through fiscal 2021.As you can tell from our guidance for fiscal 2020, we currently anticipate ending the year within our fiscal 2021 three-year margin target range, one year ahead of schedule. This is no small accomplishment given our ongoing efforts to invest in the business for the long-term.Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with our progress to date. The journey that we have embarked upon to simplify how we work, drive innovation and grow our business is a challenging one. However and more importantly, it is also providing us with great opportunities to demonstrate the value of our offerings to our clients as we continue to simplify the client experience.Through these collective efforts and with the continued strength of both our R&D organization and our worldwide sales force, we are enhancing the depth and scale of our ability to serve our clients wherever they do business with best-in-class products and solutions that fit their needs.Our clients in turn are recognizing these efforts as we continue to see improvements in both our net promoter scores as well as in our Employer Services revenue retention. It is due to the success of these efforts that we remain committed to additional shareholder friendly actions such as our recent dividend increases of nearly 45% over the past two years.Our track record of annual increases in our dividend puts us in a small minority with 30 other companies in the S&P 500 that have also grown their dividend for 45 consecutive years or more. As we look forward to the future, we remain confident that our strategy is the right one as we aim to further strengthen our resilient business model in order to drive sustainable long-term value for our shareholders.Before I turn it over to Kathleen for a detailed financial review, I want you to know how proud I am of the external recognitions that we received this quarter which reflect the strong corporate culture on which our business is built. As I reflect on our recent efforts, I'm especially proud that FORTUNE magazine again name us to their most admired companies list for the 14th consecutive time and also rank us number one in our sector. This is a remarkable achievement and a rewarding recognition for the efforts of our associates who are focused on providing our clients the best solutions both for today and for the future.I am also particularly pleased to see our efforts reflected in the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Drucker Institute list of best managed companies where we were one of the biggest movers jumping 104 places into the top quartile. These are only some of the great recognitions that we are receiving for our efforts to create opportunities for all of our stakeholders.And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kathleen for her commentary on our results and the fiscal 2020 outlook.\nKathleen Winters: Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. As Carlos mentioned, we\u2019re pleased with our continued progress in delivering growth for our shareholders and this quarter was no exception. This quarter\u2019s reported revenue growth of 5% and 6% organic constant currency is slightly ahead of our expectations and we\u2019re particularly pleased given the difficult compare to our second quarter of fiscal 2019.Our adjusted EBIT increased 9% and adjusted EBIT margin was up 70 basis points compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, both also slightly ahead of expectations due to the timing of our progress across our multiple transformation initiative.Our margin improvement continues to benefit from a combination of cost savings related to our transformation initiative and operating efficiencies. These benefits were partially offset by growth in PEO zero-margin benefits pass-through expenses, increased selling and marketing expenses and amortization expense.Similar to the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we\u2019re particularly pleased with our margin performance given the difficult compare that we faced in the first half of the year resulting from the outsized benefits in fiscal 2019 related to our Voluntary Early Retirement Program.Our adjusted effective tax rate decreased by 260 basis points to 22% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease is in line with our expectations and was mainly due to the release of a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credit carry forwards.Adjusted diluting earnings per share grew 13% to $1.52 and in addition to benefiting from our revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower adjusted effective tax rate was also aided by fewer shares outstanding compared to a year ago.Moving on to Employer Services segment and interest on funds held for clients, Employer Services revenues were slightly ahead of expectations and grew 4% reported and organic constant currency. Interest income on client funds grew 7% and benefited from growth in average client funds balances of 6% to 25.1 billion. This growth in balances continues to be driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control.Our Employer Services same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.2% for the second quarter. Employer Services margins increased 30 basis points in the quarter driven by the same factors that I mentioned earlier when discussing our consolidated results.Our PEO segment revenues grew 9% for the quarter to 1.1 billion and average worksite employees grew 6% to 579,000. Revenues, excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, grew 7% to 412 million and continued to include pressure from lower workers\u2019 compensation and SUI costs and related pricing.Our value proposition in the PEO remains strong as evidenced by our double-digit PEO new business bookings growth this quarter. Our midmarket sales channel continues to grow following the realignment of our sales incentives and we\u2019re seeing continued signs of positive traction within our downmarket referral channel.With these factors in mind, we remain optimistic in our ability to reaccelerate the PEO in the latter part of fiscal 2020. Margins in the PEO decreased about 30 basis points for the quarter largely due to a difficult compare and an increase in selling expenses resulted from our strong quarterly new business bookings growth.Let's turn to the outlook for the full year and start with the PEO. With six months behind us now and our year-to-day average worksite employee growth and revenues tracking slightly below our expectations, we do not expect to achieve the higher end of our previous guidance range.As such, we are narrowing our guidance and now expect 9% to 10% PEO revenue growth in fiscal 2020 and 7% to 8% growth in PEO revenues, excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, both driven by an anticipated growth of 7% to 8% in average worksite employees.As we also discussed last quarter, we continue to expect lower workers\u2019 compensation and SUI cost and related pricing to pressure our total PEO revenue growth. For PEO margin, we continue to anticipate margins to be flat to down 25 basis points in fiscal 2020. As we noted in previous calls, this outlook continues to include approximately 50 basis points of pressure from smaller favorable reserve adjustments at ADP Indemnity in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.Moving on, let\u2019s take a look at Employer Services. We are narrowing our guidance to 4% revenue growth versus our prior outlook of 4% to 5% driven by a combination of continued unfavorability in FX and interest rates relative to our expectations coming into the year, and the lower bookings growth in the first half of fiscal 2020.We meanwhile continue to anticipate pays per control growth of about 2.5% and Employer Services revenue retention to improve 10 to 20 basis points. And we now expect Employer Services new business bookings growth of 6% to 7%. We continue to expect our margin in the Employer Services segment to expand by 100 to 125 basis points.We now anticipate total revenue growth of about 6% in fiscal 2020 as compared to our previous outlook of 6% to 7%. This revenue outlook continues to assume an elevated level of FX on favorability for fiscal 2020 relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year.We continue to anticipate our growth in average client fund balances to be about 4%, the average yield earned on our client fund investments to be about 2.2% and interest income on client funds to be between 570 million to 580 million. We also continue to expect interest income from our extended investment strategy to be 575 million to 585 million.We continue to anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to expand 100 to 125 basis points. As a reminder, this guidance also continues to contemplate approximately 100 million in cost savings for fiscal 2020 related to our workforce optimization and procurement transformation initiatives.We now anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 23.2%. The rate includes this quarter's unplanned tax benefit from stock-based compensation related to stock option exercises. It does not, however, include any further estimated tax benefit related to potential future stock option exercises given the dependency of that benefit on the timing of those exercises. We continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 14% in fiscal 2020.Finally, before we take your questions, I wanted to let you know that shortly after our February 10 Innovation Day, Christian will be moving on to take an international assignment as the General Manager of one of our European businesses. I want to thank Christian for his many contributions leading our Investor Relations program and also welcomed Danyal Hussain who many of you already know as our new Head of Investor Relations. Congratulations to both of you.With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks. I think one of the things we\u2019ve been focused on is the retention \u2013 the improvement in the retention. Can you give us any sense of how kind of the first half scaled relative to the full year guidance?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think you can tell from our comments that it obviously improved in the second quarter and we\u2019ve tried to get away from \u2013 with the new guidance that we started providing I think was a year ago, we\u2019re trying to get away from quarterly guidance but we are still committed to giving you kind of a sense of kind of where we are. And I think you can tell from my prepared comments that we had a good first quarter and we also had a good second quarter. So retention is definitely a positive for us like we talked about last year in terms of some of the bright spots, our midmarket business retention continues to improve and is on track to really get through this year close to record levels. So it\u2019s very satisfying because we went through a very difficult time back in the day where we did all of the client upgrades and migrations and then with ACA at the same time, that was a business where we really had a real step back of retention. By the way, step back for us is a couple percentage points. Now we have recovered all of that and are kind of on track to get back to kind of where we were at record levels.\nKevin McVeigh: Understood. And then just --\nCarlos Rodriguez: I\u2019m sorry, another comment was I think we also in the first half have had good retention in the upmarket which was another place it\u2019s been kind of a challenge for us over the last couple of years. So I think both of those businesses \u2013 when you combine them, they are a significant portion of our revenues and I think have a solid retention performance.\nKevin McVeigh: That\u2019s super helpful. As a quick follow up, despite the revenue adjustment, seems like you\u2019re maintaining the margin guidance. I guess what\u2019s driving that outperformance given kind of the revenue adjustments in the PEO and I guess overall?\nCarlos Rodriguez: We have \u2013 our business model is interesting because sometimes at least for the first half as you could tell we\u2019re hoping and planning on a recovery in terms of our sales results for the second half. But in general we benefitted in the first half from an expense standpoint from having weaker new business bookings, because as you know our business has a little bit of a soft adjusting factor. Now the new 606 rules I think when you amortize some of these costs over time, they blunt some of that impact but there\u2019s still some impact from that. So we did benefit from that and we just have a lot of good things going on from a margin standpoint. We really want to make sure that we focus on the growth as well, but we feel pretty good about the initiatives that we put in place call it last fiscal year that are impacting this year\u2019s cost structure. And I think those \u2013 we talked about those as procurement initiatives, also the workforce optimization which was a delayering exercise where we reduced spends and control, so we took three layers out and increased spends across the board including all the way at the very highest levels where we had for us I would call it a significant decrease in overhead, if you will, in terms of \u2013 at our more senior levels. And so I think we\u2019re benefitting from all of those items and that\u2019s helping the margin. So we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of cost and margin. We have a lot of transformation initiatives around cost and margins and obviously we want to make sure that we focus on growth and new business bookings as well.\nKathleen Winters: Yes. Not too much to add to that. Carlos has covered a lot of the points, but we\u2019re seeing the operating efficiency come through. We\u2019re executing on the transformation projects that we have in flight right now. Saw a little bit better than expected margin expansion in the second quarter, primarily some timing on some of the transformation work. But look, the teams executing really nicely on that, particularly on the procurement side and we\u2019re focused on continuing to do that and building the pipeline of additional opportunities.\nCarlos Rodriguez: And just one little item in terms of color, you\u2019ll see from the Q that credit to the organization \u2013 again, a lot of these transformation initiatives have been \u2013 some of them when we talk about them, they\u2019re the big ones. We have dozens of other initiatives that are really improving the way we work automating things, taking out kind of non-value-added work. And when you look at our Q, you\u2019ll see that really R&D and selling expense that have increased and we really are holding the line on the rest of our operating expenses due in large part to some of these initiatives that we have underway that are making work a little bit easier for our associates and also taking some of the work out. And so that\u2019s the key because we want to make sure that we keep and we are keeping our NPS scores and our retention high. So that\u2019s the magic formula there. I think keeping our expenses lower and improving margin if it results in lower client satisfaction, lower retention is not going to help us in the long term, but fortunately and again credit to the associates and to the management team, we\u2019re actually pulling it off where we\u2019re getting both of those things right now.\nKevin McVeigh: Super. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-tsin Huang: Thanks. Good morning and congrats to Christian and Danny. I want to ask on \u2013 I guess a big picture question maybe for the team just balancing \u2013 you\u2019re balancing the new tech investments, you just mentioned the transformation initiatives in the pipeline there, but just given that you\u2019re early \u2013 you\u2019re on track to get to your fiscal year targets this year \u2013 for fiscal '20, I\u2019m sorry. Are you more willing to invest and stay in the short to midterm to maybe energize revenue growth and get that up a little bit more, or is your preference to still hit the higher end of your long-term margin target? Just trying to understand how you might be balancing revenue growth and margin expansion given where you are now?\nCarlos Rodriguez: That\u2019s a great question and I think our Board obviously has that discussion with us as well. And I think our Board is very long-term oriented. And so as much as we\u2019re committed to hitting all individual components, it\u2019s about balancing all of those factors to really create long-term sustainable growth. And we would love to have as much growth as possible. And when I think about where are some of those places that we could invest, as an example like in our sales organization, we are fully staffed. I think we\u2019re probably a little bit ahead of our plans in terms of our headcount. So we clearly have some execution issues there, especially as we mentioned in our international and multinational businesses and some difficult compares over the last year, but we have really strong performance in the downmarket and in the midmarket and even in the domestic upmarket this quarter. So it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re under investing. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure that we\u2019re not under investing in sales and marketing. We also have a brand campaign that we\u2019ve invested in over the last year which has added some expense. So I think we\u2019ve put our money where our mouth is when it comes to sales and marketing. And then turning to the other obvious places where we could invest again for growth and product in our R&D organization, again, R&D grew but always say that we could spend more. But when I look at the year-over-year and even a three-year growth of our investments in our Next-Gen platforms and even some of the additional feature functionality that we\u2019re adding to our existing product, including user experience, that\u2019s again a place where our investments are growing. So you can see it from our depreciation and amortization line, when you see it in the Q and you can see it and hear it from our words that we are \u2013 you can see in our balance sheet in terms of capitalized software. So we believe that we are investing for the future and that we have \u2013 sometimes you have these timing issues because we do have a lot of enthusiasm, for example, about our Next-Gen platforms. But relative to the size of the company, this is the first year where we have \u2013 over the last 12 months is the first time we\u2019ve actually got clients now live on our Next-Gen platforms, including Next-Gen payroll and Next-Gen HCM which we call Lifion. So we\u2019re excited. We\u2019re ahead of plan. But you have less than 10 clients on one of the platforms and call it 30 to 40 clients on another one of those platforms, so it just doesn\u2019t make a difference yet in terms of the sales results or the revenue results, but it doesn\u2019t dampen our enthusiasm around the future. So again, I guess the long and short of it is I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lack of investment, but trust us that if we see an opportunity to invest for growth, we will take it.\nTien-tsin Huang: Understood. And then just maybe on that point with the U.S. bookings, it sounds like it\u2019s more international again. So I\u2019m curious if this is more cyclical or is there some very broad base or is it more \u2013 just a few select clients just looking for a decision, just trying to better understand the visibility here on the international side?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think the most obvious one in terms of because it\u2019s easy to see and quantify is in our large Global View multinational deals, we had a very difficult compare. Now, of course, that means that 12 months ago we were celebrating getting those deals and those sales and also we talked about it that that was giving us tailwind at the time when I think we did, but we\u2019d have to go back to the transcripts. And now unfortunately now we have a very difficult compare. Now we just had our rethink meeting, we call it rethink meeting where we have all of our large multinational prospects and clients and I think we walked away with a very solid pipeline and a lot of enthusiasm. And so we feel good about hopefully the second half. And whether it\u2019s the second half or next year, but any less enthusiastic about our multinational solutions but we just have a very difficult compare. So that\u2019s an obvious place. We do have a couple of what we call in-country or best-of-breed locations that are also having some challenges that I think also have some difficult compares. But it\u2019s hard to point at any kind of cyclical or product issues, because we\u2019ve been strengthening our products overseas as well and I think investing in our sales force. So again \u2013 and European economy in particular seems to be at a minimum stabilizing if not improving. So I don\u2019t think we can point to anything cyclical which is why we remain optimistic about the turnaround.\nKathleen Winters: Yes. So maybe I\u2019ll just add a little more color and talk about it in terms of kind of U.S. bookings overall. I guess what I\u2019d say is that, look, as you go into the year there\u2019s always going to be areas where you do better and areas where you do worse than you may have planned. And thus far into the year we\u2019ve seen particular strength in downmarket as we\u2019ve noted in our comments. And actually internationally we\u2019ve also seen strength in our Celergo streamline product which was quite nice to see. And as you saw, the multinational Global View is where we were seeing really the slowness or the weakness for the last two quarters now. It\u2019s hard to say that it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re not really seeing that it\u2019s attributable to any change from an economic landscape or environment standpoint but more so just seeing delayed decision making and it\u2019s taking time to get these larger and sometimes much more complex deals through the decision making process. So we\u2019ve seen it two quarters in a row. The pipeline looks pretty decent. We\u2019ve got some of these deals in the pipeline, but remains to be seen exactly how much longer it takes to get them closed.\nTien-tsin Huang: Okay. Thanks. See you in a couple of weeks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Could I ask you to give us kind of a brief macro overview in terms of what you\u2019re seeing in your various markets given everything that\u2019s going on in the world today, any callouts or any changes in the environment?\nCarlos Rodriguez: So when we look at \u2013 we have a few things that we obviously look at in terms of, call it economic macro indicators. The ones that are kind of relatively stable I would call them relatively stable or pace for control and wage growth and we look at obviously our own data as we get ready for this earnings call but we also have the ADP research institute that publishes its own kind of wage growth information and other factors around the economy. And I think all those signs positive point to what I would call stability. Our pace for control was slightly lower than it was the previous quarter in that trend, but we\u2019ve seen that many times before where we go 2.5% one quarter and then we go a little bit lower the next quarter, but then it comes back to 2.5%. It does seem and we\u2019ve been saying it and we\u2019ve been wrong so far that as the labor markets tighten, there\u2019s just not enough people available in the U.S. to continue to drive the kind of pace for control work that we\u2019ve experienced. But obviously labor force participation has been ticking up slightly and for a variety of reasons that\u2019s continued to hum along. And again, we see the same kind of indicators that all of you see around consumer spending, et cetera. So when we look across all of our domestic businesses, the pace for control growth seems to be a reasonable indictor that the economy is on stable ground. And wage growth we think should continue to accelerate, but that\u2019s moderated slightly also for the last couple of quarters but it\u2019s still at robust levels and should drive continued consumer spending and continued consumer confidence. We do look at pace for control also outside of the U.S. and I think there we again in our numbers see some signs of stabilization in Europe when it comes through on the unemployment and pace for control metrics there. So for us I think that everything looks \u2013 bankruptcies are \u2013 we\u2019re seeing the same things at our own business that you see through external metrics. We don\u2019t see any kind of elevation or increase in out of business or bankruptcies in our downmarket business, which is the canary in the coal mines, the first place you would see it. And our sales are also strong in the downmarket and the midmarket, so it doesn\u2019t feel like the weakness we had this quarter is anything other than the lumpiness that we talked about around multinationals, because new business bookings would be another I think macro indicator that could weaken. We talked about our retention continuing to improve. Retention doesn\u2019t improve in a bad economy, because it \u2013 that\u2019s one of the things that really suffers as a result of out of business in a downmarket and that has stayed strong and solid. So no negatives that we can see in the macro.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. And you\u2019ve sort of addressed this. Dovetailing with Kathleen's last answer and your answer just now, but can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment and that doesn\u2019t manifesting itself as sort of pricing-related actions or an intensification of maybe more an increasing opposing bidders showing up for contract processes or new business models emerging out there. I\u2019m just trying to explore whether there\u2019s any other peripheral causes for some of I think what are timing-related delays in things like bookings especially maybe in Europe but elsewhere as well?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Sure. So back to maybe a little bit of what Kathleen said about, there\u2019s always \u2013 there\u2019s positive and there\u2019s negative. When it comes to competitors, it\u2019s the same thing. We have a lot of competitors in each of our segments and some years we do better, some years we do worse, but we do have the overall balance of trade and our situation there is better. And you would think that based on our retention results and based on the comments we just gave you about new business bookings in our downmarket, midmarket and domestic upmarket business. So I think in North America I think if you look at those results, I would say our competitive situation has improved and it shows in our net balance of trade that we keep track of. Particular I would point out besides the continued strength in our downmarket business which has been growing market share here for a few years, if you look at our midmarket business, the last two quarters in particular were quite strong in terms of what we call new logos against a variety of competitors. But again, we can\u2019t point to any one competitor because we have a large set of competitors. Some of them are geographically concentrated and some of them are national, but I think we\u2019re very pleased with this quarter\u2019s performance against those competitors in the midmarket. And then in the upmarket I would say that the addition of Workforce Now and call it the 1,000 to 5,000 range, so the lower end of our upmarket which we did a couple of years ago has really been an important generator of win-loss and balance of trade success for us in the upmarket. So we\u2019ve had a robust growth in units and revenue and sales dollars from introduction of Workforce Now into that 1,000 to 5,000 which addresses a segment of the market where that platform really has a lot of appeal.\nRamsey El-Assal: That is super helpful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Hi. Good morning, guys. I just want to drill in a little bit more on the commentary around the delayed decision making. Have you guys been down selected for these contracts already or is the actual RFP process still kind of dragging along?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I wish I could tell you that I have that level of detail. I don\u2019t. So this is really \u2013 it ties back to the comment I made before about we have a certain number of sales people in the field, we have a certain pipeline of dollars that we track year-over-year and we know what our sales results were the previous year in the same period whether it was the first quarter or the first two quarters of the year. So we are attributing the weakness to the late decision making. But this is not \u2013 we do have large contracts particularly in multinational and they definitely move the number from one quarter to the other, but we don\u2019t have $50 million, $100 million contracts. It\u2019s not that kind of business. So I don\u2019t put \u2013 I know our sales leaders have that level of detail. I don\u2019t have it available at my fingertips here.\nKathleen Winters: Yes, maybe you\u2019re asking kind of have we seen any particular shift in where things are in terms of stages of the cycle and stages in the pipeline. Nothing that we\u2019ve seen or heard that we can draw any conclusion from or point to any trends.\nCarlos Rodriguez: But we do have pipeline of deals \u2013 sure, we went into rethink this year with more participants, more attendees and a larger pipeline of dollar opportunity than we had the previous year.\nJason Kupferberg: Right. I was just curious if you were just kind of waiting for some final signatures to make the bookings official or if it really is a matter of kind of just broader pipeline conversion. Just my second quick follow up just on the margins. You had the 70 bps up overall in the quarter, which was better than you expected, but at the segment level I know ES was up only 30 and PEO was down 30 if I\u2019m not mistaken. So I think it was some of the below the line drivers that got you to the 70. Can you elaborate on those because I know you have some add backs in your adjusted EBIT margin calculation?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, I can help maybe a little bit with that. As you know, the transformation initiatives that we are undergoing right now, some of those are sort of back office facing as well. So if you think about procurement and the workforce optimization initiative, those will have impacts to items that what we would deem other in the segment review. So corporate functions, for example, that\u2019s where the delta probably sits for you.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay, great. Thank you, guys.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Good morning. Let me add my congratulations to both Christian and Danny. With regards to the bookings, just looking ahead and thinking about the comparisons for the third and fourth quarters, are there things that we should think from a sequencing perspective in terms of they\u2019re both \u2013 one\u2019s up 10%, one\u2019s up 11%. Is there anything that\u2019s particular in one versus the other that would make it a more difficult comp or how should we think about the bookings over the next two quarters in terms of the sequencing?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think our number one goal is to obviously maintain the momentum we have in everything other than our international and multinational businesses. And again, these businesses not just because of the big ocean between them, they are fairly separate, right, in terms of how they\u2019re managed in terms of sales and sales execution and so forth even though we have one worldwide sales organization. So we feel good that we\u2019re going to be able to maintain the momentum we have in the rest of the business and then hopefully we get a little bit of tailwind with some of this stuff going our way in terms of the larger deals and some of the international stuff that we talked about. We do have in the second half, particularly in the last quarter, we do have a difficult compare because last year as you recall we purchased \u2013 it was a client-based acquisition \u2013 an acquisition of the company with a client-based acquisition of Wells Fargo\u2019s payroll business and that helped our new business bookings and obviously translated into some revenue helping in a downmarket and it was part of what\u2019s given us some tailwind from a revenue growth standpoint in that business. But since it was a client-based acquisition, it does \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t an acquisition of a business, it does roll through our new business bookings and that was I believe in the fourth quarter.\nMark Marcon: That\u2019s [indiscernible] and that\u2019s part of the reason for asking the question. So arguably the third quarter should be a little bit of an easier comp.\nCarlos Rodriguez: For some reason they never feel easy, but mathematically \u2013 you\u2019re probably mathematically correct. But we have a lot of things that we\u2019re cooking to make sure that we hit \u2013 obviously our intention is to achieve the guidance we provided and we don\u2019t provide it lightly.\nMark Marcon: Great. And then, Carlos, obviously you\u2019ve got a longstanding set of experiences with the PEO market. How are you feeling about the longer-term trajectory of the market? What are you thinking or ex pass-throughs, the sustainable growth rate is there? And what are you seeing on the competitive front? It seems like there\u2019s a little bit more private capital that\u2019s coming into the space. So just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about that space and the legislative outlook there?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, when you look at again the balance of trade information there, I feel pretty good about our competitive situation. So you always feel good about your own children, about your business, but you got to look at the facts, right. And I think the facts are pretty good for us in terms of our win-loss in our balance of trade. So that feels pretty good. And then the second thing that makes me feel really good particularly in this quarter versus last year and started to feel it last quarter is we really took a while to kind of filter through to make sure that we had our incentives properly aligned to make sure that our sales force is focused on obviously, number one, selling the right thing to our clients but making sure that they\u2019re properly incented to make sure that the PEO is something that they raise, because it\u2019s a difficult sale, because it\u2019s a high involvement sale and so you have to have the right incentives in order for the sales force to really want to sell it. And so I think we did that and I think we talked about that. It\u2019s got to be 12 months ago I think it was. So that feels like it\u2019s starting to filter through and I think we talked about very strong double-digit new business bookings for the quarter which that\u2019s the most important metric for the future to really give us confidence that the business model is still strong and intact. So that feels pretty good.\nMark Marcon: Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSamad Samana: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I wanted to maybe ask a question about what\u2019s been going on in terms of bookings and how you\u2019re thinking about guidance. Was guidance updated just to reflect what bookings has done so far this year or have you may be made some changes to the guidance framework to account for some more of the variability or variance that you\u2019re seeing in multinational or international deals closing? So I guess is guidance more conservative or are you using the same framework that you\u2019ve historically used? And then maybe just one follow up.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes. Again, just a reminder just given the last comment that I made about the PEO that the guidance that we provide for bookings is ES only just to be clear. So if you look at our combination of our PEO and ES sales, it\u2019s a better picture and a stronger picture in the first half than what our guidance would depict, because we provide guidance for the PEO based on average worksite employee growth, not on new business bookings. But having said that, I think the answer is just \u2013 this year like there\u2019s no change in our thinking or our framework given that we just think there\u2019s some large deal delays that I don\u2019t think impact our deal in the future.\nKathleen Winters: Yes, no change in framework, no change in kind of the way we\u2019re rolling up that forecast or the data we\u2019re looking at. For example, we look at things like, okay, where\u2019s business coming from in terms of by segment or by geography or new clients versus upsell to existing clients. We\u2019re continuing to see fairly consistent trends in terms of the split between new and upsell. So no change in the framework. It\u2019s more so just, look, we\u2019ve seen slower out of the gates for two quarters now, lower than we expected in international. And so we thought it was \u2013 given that we\u2019re six months into the year here, we thought it made sense to give you our best view. So, therefore, we narrowed the view for the year.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes. Just one other comment in terms of something little bit quirky about as we changed our guidance to focus on ES worldwide bookings versus the PEO based on average worksite employees. The reason we gave you some color about the bookings for the PEO this quarter is even though we\u2019re not going to change the way we do our guidance is in some respects what\u2019s good for the PEO sometimes in the short term if business gets referred to the PEO, it can have in the short term a dampening effect on Employer Services. But we still had a great result in the downmarket and in the midmarket in Employer Services. So we definitely can\u2019t point to that. But again, it is kind of important to keep in mind that it\u2019s really the combination of those two that are driving overall ADP bookings and overall ADP revenue growth.\nSamad Samana: Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe if I could just ask one follow up. I think there\u2019s a lot of excitement around Lifion coming off of HR tech and ahead of the Innovation Day that the company is hosting. So I just wanted to see if there\u2019s any early patterns in terms of customer profile, whether it\u2019s by size or whether \u2013 what do you think about existing products that they\u2019re using, whether it\u2019s Vantage or Workforce Now, maybe where are you seeing the early adopters come from and any type of profile commentary you could give on that would be helpful? Thank you.\nCarlos Rodriguez: So again, in our case everybody\u2019s maybe approaches it differently, but we started off with smaller, less complex clients and now we\u2019ve actually just sold I\u2019ll call \u2013 consider it to be very large clients, so call it tens of thousands of employees. And so we\u2019ve got a couple of very large sales that we\u2019ve done and we have a bunch in the middle and then we have a few smaller ones that we did in the early days. Some of the business we\u2019ve sold is obviously new logo, some of it has been as you mentioned off of some of our existing platforms. I don\u2019t think that I can point to one particular platform and say that we\u2019re not targeting \u2013 because we\u2019re not trying to do migration or upgrades. We\u2019re trying to go after clients that have the right profile and the right needs, right, so that we can make them happier ADP clients in the long term. So we know what the capabilities are of the platform and we try to target the clients and the prospects whether they\u2019re internal or external in the appropriate manner. So I guess the best way to put it is it\u2019s kind of across the board in terms of \u2013 from an internal view. And then in terms of industry or size of client, fortunately it\u2019s also kind of a wide spread.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. There have been a few questions on bookings already, but this seems to be the main question of the day. The one question that I\u2019d like to explore here is you\u2019re still in the critical selling season which typically runs December to February. So is there anything you see in your pipeline in the U.S. or confidence on international close rates that gives you the confidence that you can close this critical selling season in better shape that we\u2019ve seen obviously in the second quarter and the first quarter bookings results?\nCarlos Rodriguez: So again, at the risk of getting too much into the sausage making, if you remember like part of our business particularly downmarket and into some of our midmarket, we report our sales when they start. So they\u2019re \u2013 like bookings and starts are basically equivalent. But when you get to very large deals, that\u2019s where you\u2019re really recognizing a sale and then the revenue starts at a later date. It could be six months, it could be 12 months. With a very large complex international deal, it could be 18 months later. So to your point about the critical selling season, pretty much now and done because January is the biggest month for us particularly for our downmarket business and the lower end of our midmarket business as well and the PEO. So just because of a natural cycle of the PEO, a large number of clients \u2013 by the way affect retention as well, but from a new business bookings standpoint January is the critical month for us. So the December-January period is the critical month for us in the PEO. And again, we\u2019re in the middle of that quarter so it\u2019s kind of hard to make comments about the quarter since the quarter isn\u2019t done yet. But I think in a downmarket and in our PEO in particular, we had I\u2019d say a good start to the quarter.\nKathleen Winters: Yes. The only other thing I would add and this is with regard to the ES bookings in particular, if you kind of look at the cadence of the year last year and this year and you look at six months year-to-date, we\u2019re at about the same point this year as we were last year in comparison to where we ended the year.\nDavid Togut: So in other words, you see enough in the pipeline at this point and expect to close rates that drive your expectation of the 6% to 7% bookings target. Is that accurate?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think that \u2013 again, that is a level of detail to say that we have specific things in the pipeline. I think just to reiterate what we said before, so the number one driver of our confidence in our sales results in most of our business is headcount and execution and we believe we\u2019re fully staffed and we have that headcount in place. In the place where we\u2019ve had the variability or the volatility, if you will, it does come down to what you\u2019re describing which is RFPs, pipeline, et cetera. Yes, we do believe we have the pipeline and the visibility of that pipeline to feel that we will close the gap for the rest of the year. But that\u2019s not \u2013 in our SBS business, in our downmarket business, it doesn\u2019t work that way. It\u2019s really more about the volume \u2013 it\u2019s a volume business. It\u2019s really related to having the proper amount of headcount, the right digital marketing tools and spend and again there we feel good and we feel confident.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Silber: Thanks so much. I\u2019m apologizing for asking another bookings related question. I just wanted to clarify something. I\u2019m assuming that most of your clients are in calendar year-end as opposed to your June year-end. When you talk about the late decision making, does this mean that decisions are being deferred until another year from now or is it something that could happen within the next quarter or so?\nCarlos Rodriguez: So the good news for ADP is we have clients with all kinds of year-ends because we have a lot of clients. So really it spans the gamut. But you\u2019re right that probably the average company in the U.S. has a calendar year-end. But I think most large companies and particularly multinationals which I would consider ADP to one of those, we typically when we are negotiating with a vendor for a large contract, we\u2019d be focused more on their fiscal year-end rather than our own fiscal year-end. And so you\u2019re right that there are some drivers around people\u2019s budgets and so forth, but a lot of procurement departments tend to focus on the vendors year-end. And so we\u2019ve seen historically \u2013 doesn\u2019t mean that it will happen again this year \u2013 is that our fourth quarter for large domestic and especially for large multinational deals is a particularly important quarter because prospects are recognized that even though we\u2019re not like a typical software company that negotiating towards a company\u2019s fiscal year end at least in their minds tends to be a good time to sign deals or negotiate.\nJeffrey Silber: Okay. I appreciate that --\nChristian Greyenbuhl: Sorry, Jeff, just one reminder. I know we said it before, but the 1% impact on an annual basis in business bookings equating to that 17 million, these multinational particularly Global View deals, you can imagine that if you take that on a quarterly basis, it does have \u2013 just to put it in perspective that outsized impact. So from a framing perspective, it is a pretty meaningful adjustment if you have some of these deals that flow in from one quarter to the next given that sensitivity.\nCarlos Rodriguez: On the new business bookings results.\nChristian Greyenbuhl: On the new business bookings results.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Right. Because on revenue \u2013 as you just described, the irony of the situation is that it doesn\u2019t have a big impact on revenue. We\u2019re having issues with FX and with client funds interest in particular are hurting us. It\u2019s not to deny that the bookings eventually will have some impact. The types of bookings that we have fallen short on in the first half are not particularly revenue impactful.\nJeffrey Silber: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I do appreciate the color on that. And then I know you don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, but you called out I guess the comp on the \u201cacquisition\u201d of the Wells Fargo payroll business last year. Anything else to call out between 3Q and 4Q that might affect the cadence of those quarters? Thanks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: In terms of new business bookings?\nJeffrey Silber: No, the overall business either revenues or margins?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, again, back to revenues and margins, the client funds interest issue and again going back to kind of the three-year guidance that we gave a few years ago, again, obviously not expecting a lot of sympathy from this crowd, but we\u2019re probably about $100 million less than where we expected to be in terms of client funds interest and we\u2019re obviously able to overcoming some of that as we go forward. So that in the second half is actually going to according to what I\u2019m seeing in terms of our forecast. That\u2019s going to start to have an impact on revenue growth as well, not a huge impact but where we were getting call it 1% lift in terms of revenue growth last year in the second quarter, I think this second quarter it was a much smaller number and in the second half it goes to probably no help to actually hurting our revenue growth. So that\u2019s a headwind for us. But when I really take out all these issues; FX, client funds interest and other kind of calendar noise issues, when you look at the net impact of new business bookings starts, not new business bookings sales but new business bookings starts minus losses. So if you take retention and new business that have started, if you compare last year\u2019s second quarter to this year\u2019s second quarter and hopefully the same thing continues into the second half, we have a slight acceleration. It\u2019s not a huge acceleration, but a slight acceleration. So that\u2019s what makes me feel good about the strength in the underlying business because there\u2019s a lot of noise happening in between with calendar and remember last year, we also had a one-time item that we mentioned that we called SUI pull forward in the PEO and accounting change that we were obligated to make that helped the second quarter revenue growth. And so all those things you have to kind of separate all those and get down to the core of the business and how the core business is performing. And on that basis, I feel good about the quarter and I feel good about the second half.\nKathleen Winters: Yes, the only other thing I would add to your question about kind of quarterly linearity in the balance of the year. Just as a reminder, in the second half of last year we had much, much more margin expansion in Q3 than in Q4. So, therefore, tougher comps for us this year Q3 versus Q4 in terms of margin expansion. So while we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, I would expect not a whole lot in Q3 and then potentially much more in Q4.\nCarlos Rodriguez: But again, back to like \u2013 in terms of what I mentioned in terms of some of these comparisons that were difficult versus last year\u2019s second quarter, some of those things then get easier on a revenue standpoint, notwithstanding the issues from client funds interest as we pull forward actually helped last year\u2019s second quarter, but depressed our third quarter. So that\u2019s going to make an easier comparison. So we do expect slight improvement in our revenue growth in the second half.\nChristian Greyenbuhl: And just a brief reminder of the fourth quarter, so as a reminder, so we did the client-based acquisition. So that added some amortization expense, which will lap in the fourth quarter and obviously it would increase booking expense related to the client-based acquisition as well. So just keep that in mind. And then we obviously launched our brand campaign I think in the third quarter, but most of that was really the expense was kicking off in the fourth quarter as well. So that will be lapped as well.\nJeffrey Silber: So I guess what you\u2019re saying is you got some tailwinds in the fourth quarter.\nChristian Greyenbuhl: Yes.\nJeffrey Silber: All right. Thank you for clarifying that. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have time for one final question. And our last question will come from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi. Good morning, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats to Christian and Danny from me as well. Carlos, you mentioned a couple of times and I think in the presentation the progress on both Lifion as well as the Next-Gen payroll and tax. Can you give an update on where you are on the deployments of the Next-Gen payroll and tax engines and how they\u2019re impacting your business perhaps on the retention side or some of the other impacts? Thank you.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Sure. Thanks. Very excited about the Next-Gen payroll as well as the back office tax, but the payroll engine even though it\u2019s somewhat back office I think has some positive qualities in terms of potentially helping us both in terms of \u2013 in the future both around bookings but also around efficiency and cost. I think we have somewhere between 30 and 40 live clients in our Next Generation payroll platform suite. As you can imagine, in comparison to the size of ADP, it\u2019s a relatively small impact in terms of revenue retention or any of the other actual metrics. But enormous amount of enthusiasm around what we\u2019re doing there, both at the team level. I think the team is incredibly enthusiastic and I think the rest of the organization is very enthusiastic as well in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in the early days, especially around the flexibility of how quickly we can, for example, make changes and that\u2019s just related really to the investments in the platform itself. So we\u2019ve already kind of experimented and I think we maybe talked about this in the past with kind of federation as you call it in trying to have others develop and build on that platform. We\u2019ve done the same thing on Lifion. And so now we have a team, for example, in Australia that is actually built Australian payroll and we have one or two clients on that as well. And so we\u2019re incredibly happy with what we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re really happy that we have live clients and this is the first year that \u2013 again, even though it was, call it 30 to 40 clients, this was the first time we\u2019ve gone through year-end. So we actually had to go through a year end and do all the year-end closing activities, W2s, et cetera. So it\u2019s still very early days just because of the size of ADP, but if we were a start-up, this would be like really great news. Like this was the \u2013 if this was a discussion about a start-up like we\u2019ve got now a lot of technical risk behind us, if you will, and now we have scaling and execution risk that\u2019s still in front of us. But that\u2019s a hell of a lot better than where we would have been two to three years ago, and I think it could really add to our competitiveness here in the long run, not to mention to help a lot in terms of our back office costs. On the tax side, that\u2019s probably more focused on back office cost and efficiency, but that also has an impact on our associates in terms of their ability to deliver service and also the experience that our clients have when we do things like amendments and tax notices. And so, again, the news there is very positive. We have \u2013 I think it\u2019s close to 140,000 to 150,000?\nKathleen Winters: Yes, about 140,000 clients.\nCarlos Rodriguez: About 140,000 clients. Obviously, those are smaller downmarket clients in a limited number of jurisdictions. But I think we\u2019ve now \u2013 we\u2019re up to 20 \u2013 more than 20 jurisdictions. Jurisdictions by the way refers to number of states in addition to federal, places where we can actually do the taxes. And so I\u2019d say that that\u2019s progressing also very, very well. Again, a highly flexible platform that we\u2019re very optimistic in terms of what it can do to us down the road and see no scaling issues so far in either of those platforms.\nLisa Ellis: Excellent. Thank you. That seems like a good point to end on. I\u2019ll see you guys in a couple of weeks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you. So as you can tell, we\u2019re pretty \u2013 we\u2019re pleased with the progress we continue to make on both the financials but also on our strategy. Obviously as we keep saying over and over again, we\u2019re trying to build on our success in the past but also transform for the future here so we can continue to deliver sustainable growth for many years to come.I also want to mention that this time of year as somebody mentioned about this being a busy time of the year for us from a sales standpoint, it\u2019s also a very busy time for our associates who deliver service and also our year-end commitments to our clients. It\u2019s very long hours and very hard work and I really appreciate the commitment of our associates. And again, it\u2019s one of the great differentiators we have in terms of being able to deliver that level of service, especially at a very busy time of the year like we are right now.Obviously, we wouldn\u2019t be able to be successful in the long run without strong products. And so when we have our Investor Day, we\u2019re going to hopefully lay out a plan for you about how the sustainability of the strength of ADP will be I think helped by the investments we\u2019ve been making over the last five years in our next generation products.So we look forward to spending time with you on February 10 to discuss all of these innovations that we\u2019ve been investing in, in addition to the Next-Gen platform and also discussing a little bit of our vision for the future about how we expect work to change and the HCM industry to change.And with that, I want to thank you once again for your interest in ADP and for joining us today. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Kathleen Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. As Carlos mentioned, we\u2019re pleased with our continued progress in delivering growth for our shareholders and this quarter was no exception. This quarter\u2019s reported revenue growth of 5% and 6% organic constant currency is slightly ahead of our expectations and we\u2019re particularly pleased given the difficult compare to our second quarter of fiscal 2019.Our adjusted EBIT increased 9% and adjusted EBIT margin was up 70 basis points compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019, both also slightly ahead of expectations due to the timing of our progress across our multiple transformation initiative.Our margin improvement continues to benefit from a combination of cost savings related to our transformation initiative and operating efficiencies. These benefits were partially offset by growth in PEO zero-margin benefits pass-through expenses, increased selling and marketing expenses and amortization expense.Similar to the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we\u2019re particularly pleased with our margin performance given the difficult compare that we faced in the first half of the year resulting from the outsized benefits in fiscal 2019 related to our Voluntary Early Retirement Program.Our adjusted effective tax rate decreased by 260 basis points to 22% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease is in line with our expectations and was mainly due to the release of a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credit carry forwards.Adjusted diluting earnings per share grew 13% to $1.52 and in addition to benefiting from our revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower adjusted effective tax rate was also aided by fewer shares outstanding compared to a year ago.Moving on to Employer Services segment and interest on funds held for clients, Employer Services revenues were slightly ahead of expectations and grew 4% reported and organic constant currency. Interest income on client funds grew 7% and benefited from growth in average client funds balances of 6% to 25.1 billion. This growth in balances continues to be driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control.Our Employer Services same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.2% for the second quarter. Employer Services margins increased 30 basis points in the quarter driven by the same factors that I mentioned earlier when discussing our consolidated results.Our PEO segment revenues grew 9% for the quarter to 1.1 billion and average worksite employees grew 6% to 579,000. Revenues, excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, grew 7% to 412 million and continued to include pressure from lower workers\u2019 compensation and SUI costs and related pricing.Our value proposition in the PEO remains strong as evidenced by our double-digit PEO new business bookings growth this quarter. Our midmarket sales channel continues to grow following the realignment of our sales incentives and we\u2019re seeing continued signs of positive traction within our downmarket referral channel.With these factors in mind, we remain optimistic in our ability to reaccelerate the PEO in the latter part of fiscal 2020. Margins in the PEO decreased about 30 basis points for the quarter largely due to a difficult compare and an increase in selling expenses resulted from our strong quarterly new business bookings growth.Let's turn to the outlook for the full year and start with the PEO. With six months behind us now and our year-to-day average worksite employee growth and revenues tracking slightly below our expectations, we do not expect to achieve the higher end of our previous guidance range.As such, we are narrowing our guidance and now expect 9% to 10% PEO revenue growth in fiscal 2020 and 7% to 8% growth in PEO revenues, excluding zero-margin benefits pass-throughs, both driven by an anticipated growth of 7% to 8% in average worksite employees.As we also discussed last quarter, we continue to expect lower workers\u2019 compensation and SUI cost and related pricing to pressure our total PEO revenue growth. For PEO margin, we continue to anticipate margins to be flat to down 25 basis points in fiscal 2020. As we noted in previous calls, this outlook continues to include approximately 50 basis points of pressure from smaller favorable reserve adjustments at ADP Indemnity in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.Moving on, let\u2019s take a look at Employer Services. We are narrowing our guidance to 4% revenue growth versus our prior outlook of 4% to 5% driven by a combination of continued unfavorability in FX and interest rates relative to our expectations coming into the year, and the lower bookings growth in the first half of fiscal 2020.We meanwhile continue to anticipate pays per control growth of about 2.5% and Employer Services revenue retention to improve 10 to 20 basis points. And we now expect Employer Services new business bookings growth of 6% to 7%. We continue to expect our margin in the Employer Services segment to expand by 100 to 125 basis points.We now anticipate total revenue growth of about 6% in fiscal 2020 as compared to our previous outlook of 6% to 7%. This revenue outlook continues to assume an elevated level of FX on favorability for fiscal 2020 relative to our expectations at the beginning of the year.We continue to anticipate our growth in average client fund balances to be about 4%, the average yield earned on our client fund investments to be about 2.2% and interest income on client funds to be between 570 million to 580 million. We also continue to expect interest income from our extended investment strategy to be 575 million to 585 million.We continue to anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to expand 100 to 125 basis points. As a reminder, this guidance also continues to contemplate approximately 100 million in cost savings for fiscal 2020 related to our workforce optimization and procurement transformation initiatives.We now anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 23.2%. The rate includes this quarter's unplanned tax benefit from stock-based compensation related to stock option exercises. It does not, however, include any further estimated tax benefit related to potential future stock option exercises given the dependency of that benefit on the timing of those exercises. We continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 14% in fiscal 2020.Finally, before we take your questions, I wanted to let you know that shortly after our February 10 Innovation Day, Christian will be moving on to take an international assignment as the General Manager of one of our European businesses. I want to thank Christian for his many contributions leading our Investor Relations program and also welcomed Danyal Hussain who many of you already know as our new Head of Investor Relations. Congratulations to both of you.With that, I will turn the call over to the operator to take your questions. Yes. Not too much to add to that. Carlos has covered a lot of the points, but we\u2019re seeing the operating efficiency come through. We\u2019re executing on the transformation projects that we have in flight right now. Saw a little bit better than expected margin expansion in the second quarter, primarily some timing on some of the transformation work. But look, the teams executing really nicely on that, particularly on the procurement side and we\u2019re focused on continuing to do that and building the pipeline of additional opportunities. Yes. So maybe I\u2019ll just add a little more color and talk about it in terms of kind of U.S. bookings overall. I guess what I\u2019d say is that, look, as you go into the year there\u2019s always going to be areas where you do better and areas where you do worse than you may have planned. And thus far into the year we\u2019ve seen particular strength in downmarket as we\u2019ve noted in our comments. And actually internationally we\u2019ve also seen strength in our Celergo streamline product which was quite nice to see. And as you saw, the multinational Global View is where we were seeing really the slowness or the weakness for the last two quarters now. It\u2019s hard to say that it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re not really seeing that it\u2019s attributable to any change from an economic landscape or environment standpoint but more so just seeing delayed decision making and it\u2019s taking time to get these larger and sometimes much more complex deals through the decision making process. So we\u2019ve seen it two quarters in a row. The pipeline looks pretty decent. We\u2019ve got some of these deals in the pipeline, but remains to be seen exactly how much longer it takes to get them closed. Yes, maybe you\u2019re asking kind of have we seen any particular shift in where things are in terms of stages of the cycle and stages in the pipeline. Nothing that we\u2019ve seen or heard that we can draw any conclusion from or point to any trends. Yes, no change in framework, no change in kind of the way we\u2019re rolling up that forecast or the data we\u2019re looking at. For example, we look at things like, okay, where\u2019s business coming from in terms of by segment or by geography or new clients versus upsell to existing clients. We\u2019re continuing to see fairly consistent trends in terms of the split between new and upsell. So no change in the framework. It\u2019s more so just, look, we\u2019ve seen slower out of the gates for two quarters now, lower than we expected in international. And so we thought it was \u2013 given that we\u2019re six months into the year here, we thought it made sense to give you our best view. So, therefore, we narrowed the view for the year. Yes. The only other thing I would add and this is with regard to the ES bookings in particular, if you kind of look at the cadence of the year last year and this year and you look at six months year-to-date, we\u2019re at about the same point this year as we were last year in comparison to where we ended the year. Yes, the only other thing I would add to your question about kind of quarterly linearity in the balance of the year. Just as a reminder, in the second half of last year we had much, much more margin expansion in Q3 than in Q4. So, therefore, tougher comps for us this year Q3 versus Q4 in terms of margin expansion. So while we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance, I would expect not a whole lot in Q3 and then potentially much more in Q4. Yes, about 140,000 clients."

            "name": "Carlos Rodriguez",
            "content": "Thank you, Christian, and thank you everyone for joining our call. This morning, we reported our second quarter fiscal 2020 results with revenue of 3.7 billion for the quarter, up 5% reported and organic constant currency. We are pleased with this revenue growth, which was slightly ahead of our expectations.Our adjusted EBIT margin increased 70 basis points for the quarter and was also slightly ahead of our expectations. Together with share buybacks and a lower adjusted effective tax rate, these results helped us deliver 13% adjusted EPS growth in this quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our progress through the first half of fiscal 2020 following a difficult compare with the first half of fiscal 2019.Moving on to operations and starting with new business bookings. This quarter, we continue to see strength in our Employer Services downmarket offerings and solid progress on the sales of our Workforce Now solutions. We were also particularly pleased to see strong double-digit bookings growth in our PEO.With that said, we are disappointed with our 3% Employer Services new business bookings growth for the quarter. This lower than expected growth was mainly the result of the same trends we saw in the first quarter with our international and multinational businesses, including delayed decisions for some of our larger multinational sales opportunities.As we have said before, given their size, these opportunities can have an outsized impact on our quarterly booking metric. With this in mind, we have narrowed our full year Employer Services new business bookings outlook and now expect 6% to 7% growth as compared to our previous guidance of 6% to 8% growth on last year\u2019s 1.6 billion of Employer Services new business bookings. We continue to have a solid pipeline of opportunities and we remain confident in our ability to execute across our portfolio.Looking at client service, we continue to see good progress with overall strength in our net promoter scores and retention. As a result, we continue to expect our forecasted full year fiscal 2020 Employer Services revenue retention to increase 10 to 20 basis points.Now we\u2019re halfway to fiscal 2020 and at the midpoint of our three-year targets we outlined at our June 2018 Investor Day. As we are also six months away from giving our fiscal 2021 guidance and we will not be giving any updated financial outlook at our upcoming Innovation Day, I want to take a few moments here to look back and share my thoughts on our progress since we provided that guidance.Let\u2019s start with new business bookings. You will recall that our June 2018 Investor Day, we outlined that we were targeting growth for worldwide new business bookings growth of 7% to 9% through 2021. Though we no longer regularly report a worldwide bookings figure, which as a reminder includes the results of Employer Services and PEO segments together, we thought it would helpful in that context of a midpoint look back to share that we have seen 8% average quarter growth since the beginning of fiscal 2019.We are pleased with this worldwide bookings growth together with our improvements in Employer Services revenue retention and how they demonstrate the strength and stability of our business even as we\u2019ve been going through meaningful transformation as an organization with a set of broad-based initiatives, including our Service Alignment Initiative in fiscal years 2017 and '18, our Voluntary Early Retirement Program in fiscal 2019 and most recently our Workforce Optimization and Procurement initiatives.Meanwhile, our quarterly average consolidated revenue grew 6% reported and organic constant currency over the past 18 months. As we look at some of the developments that have affected our recent growth relative to our expectations, we note that our PEO has not performed in line with our long-term expectations driven by lower than expected pass-through revenues and lower than planned worksite employee growth.Over the past several quarters, we have discussed some of the factors impacting PEO revenue growth, including the impacts from our sales incentives, recent retention unfavorability related to healthcare inflation and softness in workers\u2019 compensation and state unemployment insurance rates.With the impact of these factors, our average growth over the past 18 months in average worksite employees was 8% as compared to our long-term expectation of 9% to 11%. And a contribution to revenue growth from pass-throughs was 1% compared to our long-term expectation of 1% to 3%.Despite the slight underperformance relative to our expectations, we are confident in the overall prospects of the PEO business and continue to see healthy demand for our offerings. Our PEO platform is the leading fully outsourced solution in the HCM market and we combine this with best-in-class HR business partners, which together helps deliver an unparalleled service experience.Stepping back now to total revenue, we are tracking at 6% average growth through six quarters. We have a solid playbook with a proven track record of driving sustained growth and we\u2019ll continue to focus on delivering consistent strong bookings growth and retention performance as key priorities.And moving down the P&L, during this period we further solidified the foundations of our business as our associates continue to transform the way we work while also delivering innovative solutions to our clients.These transformation efforts along with our steady top line growth and the operating leverage in our model have helped deliver robust margin expansion and an average adjusted EBIT growth of 13% through the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020, which is within the range of our fiscal 2021 target CAGR of 12.5% to 15.5%.This together with our disciplined share buybacks and a lower adjusted effective tax rate has driven adjusted EPS growth of 18%, which is tracking ahead of our targeted growth of 14.5% to 17.5% through fiscal 2021.As you can tell from our guidance for fiscal 2020, we currently anticipate ending the year within our fiscal 2021 three-year margin target range, one year ahead of schedule. This is no small accomplishment given our ongoing efforts to invest in the business for the long-term.Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with our progress to date. The journey that we have embarked upon to simplify how we work, drive innovation and grow our business is a challenging one. However and more importantly, it is also providing us with great opportunities to demonstrate the value of our offerings to our clients as we continue to simplify the client experience.Through these collective efforts and with the continued strength of both our R&D organization and our worldwide sales force, we are enhancing the depth and scale of our ability to serve our clients wherever they do business with best-in-class products and solutions that fit their needs.Our clients in turn are recognizing these efforts as we continue to see improvements in both our net promoter scores as well as in our Employer Services revenue retention. It is due to the success of these efforts that we remain committed to additional shareholder friendly actions such as our recent dividend increases of nearly 45% over the past two years.Our track record of annual increases in our dividend puts us in a small minority with 30 other companies in the S&P 500 that have also grown their dividend for 45 consecutive years or more. As we look forward to the future, we remain confident that our strategy is the right one as we aim to further strengthen our resilient business model in order to drive sustainable long-term value for our shareholders.Before I turn it over to Kathleen for a detailed financial review, I want you to know how proud I am of the external recognitions that we received this quarter which reflect the strong corporate culture on which our business is built. As I reflect on our recent efforts, I'm especially proud that FORTUNE magazine again name us to their most admired companies list for the 14th consecutive time and also rank us number one in our sector. This is a remarkable achievement and a rewarding recognition for the efforts of our associates who are focused on providing our clients the best solutions both for today and for the future.I am also particularly pleased to see our efforts reflected in the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Drucker Institute list of best managed companies where we were one of the biggest movers jumping 104 places into the top quartile. These are only some of the great recognitions that we are receiving for our efforts to create opportunities for all of our stakeholders.And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kathleen for her commentary on our results and the fiscal 2020 outlook. I think you can tell from our comments that it obviously improved in the second quarter and we\u2019ve tried to get away from \u2013 with the new guidance that we started providing I think was a year ago, we\u2019re trying to get away from quarterly guidance but we are still committed to giving you kind of a sense of kind of where we are. And I think you can tell from my prepared comments that we had a good first quarter and we also had a good second quarter. So retention is definitely a positive for us like we talked about last year in terms of some of the bright spots, our midmarket business retention continues to improve and is on track to really get through this year close to record levels. So it\u2019s very satisfying because we went through a very difficult time back in the day where we did all of the client upgrades and migrations and then with ACA at the same time, that was a business where we really had a real step back of retention. By the way, step back for us is a couple percentage points. Now we have recovered all of that and are kind of on track to get back to kind of where we were at record levels. I\u2019m sorry, another comment was I think we also in the first half have had good retention in the upmarket which was another place it\u2019s been kind of a challenge for us over the last couple of years. So I think both of those businesses \u2013 when you combine them, they are a significant portion of our revenues and I think have a solid retention performance. We have \u2013 our business model is interesting because sometimes at least for the first half as you could tell we\u2019re hoping and planning on a recovery in terms of our sales results for the second half. But in general we benefitted in the first half from an expense standpoint from having weaker new business bookings, because as you know our business has a little bit of a soft adjusting factor. Now the new 606 rules I think when you amortize some of these costs over time, they blunt some of that impact but there\u2019s still some impact from that. So we did benefit from that and we just have a lot of good things going on from a margin standpoint. We really want to make sure that we focus on the growth as well, but we feel pretty good about the initiatives that we put in place call it last fiscal year that are impacting this year\u2019s cost structure. And I think those \u2013 we talked about those as procurement initiatives, also the workforce optimization which was a delayering exercise where we reduced spends and control, so we took three layers out and increased spends across the board including all the way at the very highest levels where we had for us I would call it a significant decrease in overhead, if you will, in terms of \u2013 at our more senior levels. And so I think we\u2019re benefitting from all of those items and that\u2019s helping the margin. So we feel pretty good about where we are in terms of cost and margin. We have a lot of transformation initiatives around cost and margins and obviously we want to make sure that we focus on growth and new business bookings as well. And just one little item in terms of color, you\u2019ll see from the Q that credit to the organization \u2013 again, a lot of these transformation initiatives have been \u2013 some of them when we talk about them, they\u2019re the big ones. We have dozens of other initiatives that are really improving the way we work automating things, taking out kind of non-value-added work. And when you look at our Q, you\u2019ll see that really R&D and selling expense that have increased and we really are holding the line on the rest of our operating expenses due in large part to some of these initiatives that we have underway that are making work a little bit easier for our associates and also taking some of the work out. And so that\u2019s the key because we want to make sure that we keep and we are keeping our NPS scores and our retention high. So that\u2019s the magic formula there. I think keeping our expenses lower and improving margin if it results in lower client satisfaction, lower retention is not going to help us in the long term, but fortunately and again credit to the associates and to the management team, we\u2019re actually pulling it off where we\u2019re getting both of those things right now. That\u2019s a great question and I think our Board obviously has that discussion with us as well. And I think our Board is very long-term oriented. And so as much as we\u2019re committed to hitting all individual components, it\u2019s about balancing all of those factors to really create long-term sustainable growth. And we would love to have as much growth as possible. And when I think about where are some of those places that we could invest, as an example like in our sales organization, we are fully staffed. I think we\u2019re probably a little bit ahead of our plans in terms of our headcount. So we clearly have some execution issues there, especially as we mentioned in our international and multinational businesses and some difficult compares over the last year, but we have really strong performance in the downmarket and in the midmarket and even in the domestic upmarket this quarter. So it doesn\u2019t feel like we\u2019re under investing. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure that we\u2019re not under investing in sales and marketing. We also have a brand campaign that we\u2019ve invested in over the last year which has added some expense. So I think we\u2019ve put our money where our mouth is when it comes to sales and marketing. And then turning to the other obvious places where we could invest again for growth and product in our R&D organization, again, R&D grew but always say that we could spend more. But when I look at the year-over-year and even a three-year growth of our investments in our Next-Gen platforms and even some of the additional feature functionality that we\u2019re adding to our existing product, including user experience, that\u2019s again a place where our investments are growing. So you can see it from our depreciation and amortization line, when you see it in the Q and you can see it and hear it from our words that we are \u2013 you can see in our balance sheet in terms of capitalized software. So we believe that we are investing for the future and that we have \u2013 sometimes you have these timing issues because we do have a lot of enthusiasm, for example, about our Next-Gen platforms. But relative to the size of the company, this is the first year where we have \u2013 over the last 12 months is the first time we\u2019ve actually got clients now live on our Next-Gen platforms, including Next-Gen payroll and Next-Gen HCM which we call Lifion. So we\u2019re excited. We\u2019re ahead of plan. But you have less than 10 clients on one of the platforms and call it 30 to 40 clients on another one of those platforms, so it just doesn\u2019t make a difference yet in terms of the sales results or the revenue results, but it doesn\u2019t dampen our enthusiasm around the future. So again, I guess the long and short of it is I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a lack of investment, but trust us that if we see an opportunity to invest for growth, we will take it. I think the most obvious one in terms of because it\u2019s easy to see and quantify is in our large Global View multinational deals, we had a very difficult compare. Now, of course, that means that 12 months ago we were celebrating getting those deals and those sales and also we talked about it that that was giving us tailwind at the time when I think we did, but we\u2019d have to go back to the transcripts. And now unfortunately now we have a very difficult compare. Now we just had our rethink meeting, we call it rethink meeting where we have all of our large multinational prospects and clients and I think we walked away with a very solid pipeline and a lot of enthusiasm. And so we feel good about hopefully the second half. And whether it\u2019s the second half or next year, but any less enthusiastic about our multinational solutions but we just have a very difficult compare. So that\u2019s an obvious place. We do have a couple of what we call in-country or best-of-breed locations that are also having some challenges that I think also have some difficult compares. But it\u2019s hard to point at any kind of cyclical or product issues, because we\u2019ve been strengthening our products overseas as well and I think investing in our sales force. So again \u2013 and European economy in particular seems to be at a minimum stabilizing if not improving. So I don\u2019t think we can point to anything cyclical which is why we remain optimistic about the turnaround. Thank you. So when we look at \u2013 we have a few things that we obviously look at in terms of, call it economic macro indicators. The ones that are kind of relatively stable I would call them relatively stable or pace for control and wage growth and we look at obviously our own data as we get ready for this earnings call but we also have the ADP research institute that publishes its own kind of wage growth information and other factors around the economy. And I think all those signs positive point to what I would call stability. Our pace for control was slightly lower than it was the previous quarter in that trend, but we\u2019ve seen that many times before where we go 2.5% one quarter and then we go a little bit lower the next quarter, but then it comes back to 2.5%. It does seem and we\u2019ve been saying it and we\u2019ve been wrong so far that as the labor markets tighten, there\u2019s just not enough people available in the U.S. to continue to drive the kind of pace for control work that we\u2019ve experienced. But obviously labor force participation has been ticking up slightly and for a variety of reasons that\u2019s continued to hum along. And again, we see the same kind of indicators that all of you see around consumer spending, et cetera. So when we look across all of our domestic businesses, the pace for control growth seems to be a reasonable indictor that the economy is on stable ground. And wage growth we think should continue to accelerate, but that\u2019s moderated slightly also for the last couple of quarters but it\u2019s still at robust levels and should drive continued consumer spending and continued consumer confidence. We do look at pace for control also outside of the U.S. and I think there we again in our numbers see some signs of stabilization in Europe when it comes through on the unemployment and pace for control metrics there. So for us I think that everything looks \u2013 bankruptcies are \u2013 we\u2019re seeing the same things at our own business that you see through external metrics. We don\u2019t see any kind of elevation or increase in out of business or bankruptcies in our downmarket business, which is the canary in the coal mines, the first place you would see it. And our sales are also strong in the downmarket and the midmarket, so it doesn\u2019t feel like the weakness we had this quarter is anything other than the lumpiness that we talked about around multinationals, because new business bookings would be another I think macro indicator that could weaken. We talked about our retention continuing to improve. Retention doesn\u2019t improve in a bad economy, because it \u2013 that\u2019s one of the things that really suffers as a result of out of business in a downmarket and that has stayed strong and solid. So no negatives that we can see in the macro. Sure. So back to maybe a little bit of what Kathleen said about, there\u2019s always \u2013 there\u2019s positive and there\u2019s negative. When it comes to competitors, it\u2019s the same thing. We have a lot of competitors in each of our segments and some years we do better, some years we do worse, but we do have the overall balance of trade and our situation there is better. And you would think that based on our retention results and based on the comments we just gave you about new business bookings in our downmarket, midmarket and domestic upmarket business. So I think in North America I think if you look at those results, I would say our competitive situation has improved and it shows in our net balance of trade that we keep track of. Particular I would point out besides the continued strength in our downmarket business which has been growing market share here for a few years, if you look at our midmarket business, the last two quarters in particular were quite strong in terms of what we call new logos against a variety of competitors. But again, we can\u2019t point to any one competitor because we have a large set of competitors. Some of them are geographically concentrated and some of them are national, but I think we\u2019re very pleased with this quarter\u2019s performance against those competitors in the midmarket. And then in the upmarket I would say that the addition of Workforce Now and call it the 1,000 to 5,000 range, so the lower end of our upmarket which we did a couple of years ago has really been an important generator of win-loss and balance of trade success for us in the upmarket. So we\u2019ve had a robust growth in units and revenue and sales dollars from introduction of Workforce Now into that 1,000 to 5,000 which addresses a segment of the market where that platform really has a lot of appeal. I wish I could tell you that I have that level of detail. I don\u2019t. So this is really \u2013 it ties back to the comment I made before about we have a certain number of sales people in the field, we have a certain pipeline of dollars that we track year-over-year and we know what our sales results were the previous year in the same period whether it was the first quarter or the first two quarters of the year. So we are attributing the weakness to the late decision making. But this is not \u2013 we do have large contracts particularly in multinational and they definitely move the number from one quarter to the other, but we don\u2019t have $50 million, $100 million contracts. It\u2019s not that kind of business. So I don\u2019t put \u2013 I know our sales leaders have that level of detail. I don\u2019t have it available at my fingertips here. But we do have pipeline of deals \u2013 sure, we went into rethink this year with more participants, more attendees and a larger pipeline of dollar opportunity than we had the previous year. Yes, I can help maybe a little bit with that. As you know, the transformation initiatives that we are undergoing right now, some of those are sort of back office facing as well. So if you think about procurement and the workforce optimization initiative, those will have impacts to items that what we would deem other in the segment review. So corporate functions, for example, that\u2019s where the delta probably sits for you. Thank you. I think our number one goal is to obviously maintain the momentum we have in everything other than our international and multinational businesses. And again, these businesses not just because of the big ocean between them, they are fairly separate, right, in terms of how they\u2019re managed in terms of sales and sales execution and so forth even though we have one worldwide sales organization. So we feel good that we\u2019re going to be able to maintain the momentum we have in the rest of the business and then hopefully we get a little bit of tailwind with some of this stuff going our way in terms of the larger deals and some of the international stuff that we talked about. We do have in the second half, particularly in the last quarter, we do have a difficult compare because last year as you recall we purchased \u2013 it was a client-based acquisition \u2013 an acquisition of the company with a client-based acquisition of Wells Fargo\u2019s payroll business and that helped our new business bookings and obviously translated into some revenue helping in a downmarket and it was part of what\u2019s given us some tailwind from a revenue growth standpoint in that business. But since it was a client-based acquisition, it does \u2013 and it wasn\u2019t an acquisition of a business, it does roll through our new business bookings and that was I believe in the fourth quarter. For some reason they never feel easy, but mathematically \u2013 you\u2019re probably mathematically correct. But we have a lot of things that we\u2019re cooking to make sure that we hit \u2013 obviously our intention is to achieve the guidance we provided and we don\u2019t provide it lightly. Well, when you look at again the balance of trade information there, I feel pretty good about our competitive situation. So you always feel good about your own children, about your business, but you got to look at the facts, right. And I think the facts are pretty good for us in terms of our win-loss in our balance of trade. So that feels pretty good. And then the second thing that makes me feel really good particularly in this quarter versus last year and started to feel it last quarter is we really took a while to kind of filter through to make sure that we had our incentives properly aligned to make sure that our sales force is focused on obviously, number one, selling the right thing to our clients but making sure that they\u2019re properly incented to make sure that the PEO is something that they raise, because it\u2019s a difficult sale, because it\u2019s a high involvement sale and so you have to have the right incentives in order for the sales force to really want to sell it. And so I think we did that and I think we talked about that. It\u2019s got to be 12 months ago I think it was. So that feels like it\u2019s starting to filter through and I think we talked about very strong double-digit new business bookings for the quarter which that\u2019s the most important metric for the future to really give us confidence that the business model is still strong and intact. So that feels pretty good. Yes. Again, just a reminder just given the last comment that I made about the PEO that the guidance that we provide for bookings is ES only just to be clear. So if you look at our combination of our PEO and ES sales, it\u2019s a better picture and a stronger picture in the first half than what our guidance would depict, because we provide guidance for the PEO based on average worksite employee growth, not on new business bookings. But having said that, I think the answer is just \u2013 this year like there\u2019s no change in our thinking or our framework given that we just think there\u2019s some large deal delays that I don\u2019t think impact our deal in the future. Yes. Just one other comment in terms of something little bit quirky about as we changed our guidance to focus on ES worldwide bookings versus the PEO based on average worksite employees. The reason we gave you some color about the bookings for the PEO this quarter is even though we\u2019re not going to change the way we do our guidance is in some respects what\u2019s good for the PEO sometimes in the short term if business gets referred to the PEO, it can have in the short term a dampening effect on Employer Services. But we still had a great result in the downmarket and in the midmarket in Employer Services. So we definitely can\u2019t point to that. But again, it is kind of important to keep in mind that it\u2019s really the combination of those two that are driving overall ADP bookings and overall ADP revenue growth. So again, in our case everybody\u2019s maybe approaches it differently, but we started off with smaller, less complex clients and now we\u2019ve actually just sold I\u2019ll call \u2013 consider it to be very large clients, so call it tens of thousands of employees. And so we\u2019ve got a couple of very large sales that we\u2019ve done and we have a bunch in the middle and then we have a few smaller ones that we did in the early days. Some of the business we\u2019ve sold is obviously new logo, some of it has been as you mentioned off of some of our existing platforms. I don\u2019t think that I can point to one particular platform and say that we\u2019re not targeting \u2013 because we\u2019re not trying to do migration or upgrades. We\u2019re trying to go after clients that have the right profile and the right needs, right, so that we can make them happier ADP clients in the long term. So we know what the capabilities are of the platform and we try to target the clients and the prospects whether they\u2019re internal or external in the appropriate manner. So I guess the best way to put it is it\u2019s kind of across the board in terms of \u2013 from an internal view. And then in terms of industry or size of client, fortunately it\u2019s also kind of a wide spread. So again, at the risk of getting too much into the sausage making, if you remember like part of our business particularly downmarket and into some of our midmarket, we report our sales when they start. So they\u2019re \u2013 like bookings and starts are basically equivalent. But when you get to very large deals, that\u2019s where you\u2019re really recognizing a sale and then the revenue starts at a later date. It could be six months, it could be 12 months. With a very large complex international deal, it could be 18 months later. So to your point about the critical selling season, pretty much now and done because January is the biggest month for us particularly for our downmarket business and the lower end of our midmarket business as well and the PEO. So just because of a natural cycle of the PEO, a large number of clients \u2013 by the way affect retention as well, but from a new business bookings standpoint January is the critical month for us. So the December-January period is the critical month for us in the PEO. And again, we\u2019re in the middle of that quarter so it\u2019s kind of hard to make comments about the quarter since the quarter isn\u2019t done yet. But I think in a downmarket and in our PEO in particular, we had I\u2019d say a good start to the quarter. I think that \u2013 again, that is a level of detail to say that we have specific things in the pipeline. I think just to reiterate what we said before, so the number one driver of our confidence in our sales results in most of our business is headcount and execution and we believe we\u2019re fully staffed and we have that headcount in place. In the place where we\u2019ve had the variability or the volatility, if you will, it does come down to what you\u2019re describing which is RFPs, pipeline, et cetera. Yes, we do believe we have the pipeline and the visibility of that pipeline to feel that we will close the gap for the rest of the year. But that\u2019s not \u2013 in our SBS business, in our downmarket business, it doesn\u2019t work that way. It\u2019s really more about the volume \u2013 it\u2019s a volume business. It\u2019s really related to having the proper amount of headcount, the right digital marketing tools and spend and again there we feel good and we feel confident. So the good news for ADP is we have clients with all kinds of year-ends because we have a lot of clients. So really it spans the gamut. But you\u2019re right that probably the average company in the U.S. has a calendar year-end. But I think most large companies and particularly multinationals which I would consider ADP to one of those, we typically when we are negotiating with a vendor for a large contract, we\u2019d be focused more on their fiscal year-end rather than our own fiscal year-end. And so you\u2019re right that there are some drivers around people\u2019s budgets and so forth, but a lot of procurement departments tend to focus on the vendors year-end. And so we\u2019ve seen historically \u2013 doesn\u2019t mean that it will happen again this year \u2013 is that our fourth quarter for large domestic and especially for large multinational deals is a particularly important quarter because prospects are recognized that even though we\u2019re not like a typical software company that negotiating towards a company\u2019s fiscal year end at least in their minds tends to be a good time to sign deals or negotiate. On the new business bookings results. Right. Because on revenue \u2013 as you just described, the irony of the situation is that it doesn\u2019t have a big impact on revenue. We\u2019re having issues with FX and with client funds interest in particular are hurting us. It\u2019s not to deny that the bookings eventually will have some impact. The types of bookings that we have fallen short on in the first half are not particularly revenue impactful. In terms of new business bookings? Well, again, back to revenues and margins, the client funds interest issue and again going back to kind of the three-year guidance that we gave a few years ago, again, obviously not expecting a lot of sympathy from this crowd, but we\u2019re probably about $100 million less than where we expected to be in terms of client funds interest and we\u2019re obviously able to overcoming some of that as we go forward. So that in the second half is actually going to according to what I\u2019m seeing in terms of our forecast. That\u2019s going to start to have an impact on revenue growth as well, not a huge impact but where we were getting call it 1% lift in terms of revenue growth last year in the second quarter, I think this second quarter it was a much smaller number and in the second half it goes to probably no help to actually hurting our revenue growth. So that\u2019s a headwind for us. But when I really take out all these issues; FX, client funds interest and other kind of calendar noise issues, when you look at the net impact of new business bookings starts, not new business bookings sales but new business bookings starts minus losses. So if you take retention and new business that have started, if you compare last year\u2019s second quarter to this year\u2019s second quarter and hopefully the same thing continues into the second half, we have a slight acceleration. It\u2019s not a huge acceleration, but a slight acceleration. So that\u2019s what makes me feel good about the strength in the underlying business because there\u2019s a lot of noise happening in between with calendar and remember last year, we also had a one-time item that we mentioned that we called SUI pull forward in the PEO and accounting change that we were obligated to make that helped the second quarter revenue growth. And so all those things you have to kind of separate all those and get down to the core of the business and how the core business is performing. And on that basis, I feel good about the quarter and I feel good about the second half. But again, back to like \u2013 in terms of what I mentioned in terms of some of these comparisons that were difficult versus last year\u2019s second quarter, some of those things then get easier on a revenue standpoint, notwithstanding the issues from client funds interest as we pull forward actually helped last year\u2019s second quarter, but depressed our third quarter. So that\u2019s going to make an easier comparison. So we do expect slight improvement in our revenue growth in the second half. Sure. Thanks. Very excited about the Next-Gen payroll as well as the back office tax, but the payroll engine even though it\u2019s somewhat back office I think has some positive qualities in terms of potentially helping us both in terms of \u2013 in the future both around bookings but also around efficiency and cost. I think we have somewhere between 30 and 40 live clients in our Next Generation payroll platform suite. As you can imagine, in comparison to the size of ADP, it\u2019s a relatively small impact in terms of revenue retention or any of the other actual metrics. But enormous amount of enthusiasm around what we\u2019re doing there, both at the team level. I think the team is incredibly enthusiastic and I think the rest of the organization is very enthusiastic as well in terms of what we\u2019re seeing in the early days, especially around the flexibility of how quickly we can, for example, make changes and that\u2019s just related really to the investments in the platform itself. So we\u2019ve already kind of experimented and I think we maybe talked about this in the past with kind of federation as you call it in trying to have others develop and build on that platform. We\u2019ve done the same thing on Lifion. And so now we have a team, for example, in Australia that is actually built Australian payroll and we have one or two clients on that as well. And so we\u2019re incredibly happy with what we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re really happy that we have live clients and this is the first year that \u2013 again, even though it was, call it 30 to 40 clients, this was the first time we\u2019ve gone through year-end. So we actually had to go through a year end and do all the year-end closing activities, W2s, et cetera. So it\u2019s still very early days just because of the size of ADP, but if we were a start-up, this would be like really great news. Like this was the \u2013 if this was a discussion about a start-up like we\u2019ve got now a lot of technical risk behind us, if you will, and now we have scaling and execution risk that\u2019s still in front of us. But that\u2019s a hell of a lot better than where we would have been two to three years ago, and I think it could really add to our competitiveness here in the long run, not to mention to help a lot in terms of our back office costs. On the tax side, that\u2019s probably more focused on back office cost and efficiency, but that also has an impact on our associates in terms of their ability to deliver service and also the experience that our clients have when we do things like amendments and tax notices. And so, again, the news there is very positive. We have \u2013 I think it\u2019s close to 140,000 to 150,000? About 140,000 clients. Obviously, those are smaller downmarket clients in a limited number of jurisdictions. But I think we\u2019ve now \u2013 we\u2019re up to 20 \u2013 more than 20 jurisdictions. Jurisdictions by the way refers to number of states in addition to federal, places where we can actually do the taxes. And so I\u2019d say that that\u2019s progressing also very, very well. Again, a highly flexible platform that we\u2019re very optimistic in terms of what it can do to us down the road and see no scaling issues so far in either of those platforms. Thank you very much. Thank you. So as you can tell, we\u2019re pretty \u2013 we\u2019re pleased with the progress we continue to make on both the financials but also on our strategy. Obviously as we keep saying over and over again, we\u2019re trying to build on our success in the past but also transform for the future here so we can continue to deliver sustainable growth for many years to come.I also want to mention that this time of year as somebody mentioned about this being a busy time of the year for us from a sales standpoint, it\u2019s also a very busy time for our associates who deliver service and also our year-end commitments to our clients. It\u2019s very long hours and very hard work and I really appreciate the commitment of our associates. And again, it\u2019s one of the great differentiators we have in terms of being able to deliver that level of service, especially at a very busy time of the year like we are right now.Obviously, we wouldn\u2019t be able to be successful in the long run without strong products. And so when we have our Investor Day, we\u2019re going to hopefully lay out a plan for you about how the sustainability of the strength of ADP will be I think helped by the investments we\u2019ve been making over the last five years in our next generation products.So we look forward to spending time with you on February 10 to discuss all of these innovations that we\u2019ve been investing in, in addition to the Next-Gen platform and also discussing a little bit of our vision for the future about how we expect work to change and the HCM industry to change.And with that, I want to thank you once again for your interest in ADP and for joining us today. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Greyenbuhl, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChristian Greyenbuhl: Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining ADP\u2019s first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call and webcast. With me today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer.Earlier this morning, we released our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. The earnings materials are available on the SEC\u2019s website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segment.During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description and the timing of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measure can be found in our earnings release.Today\u2019s call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, as such, involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.Before turning the call over to Carlos, you would have noticed in today\u2019s earnings that we made a correction this quarter to certain PEOs zero margin pass-through revenues that we have previously reported on a gross basis and which going forward will be reported on a net basis.For consistency, we also revise prior periods and the total impact to fiscal 2019 revenues and operating expenses was $65 million. This does not materially impact our previously reported growth rates and does not impact consolidated earnings before income taxes, net earnings, consolidated financial condition or cash flows. To better assist you, we have also included the details of these adjustments in the appendix to the presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call. Our supplemental schedule of quarterly history of revenue and pre-tax earnings by reportable segments also reflects the impacts of these changes.Accordingly, our reported results and full year outlook and the following commentary from both Carlos and Kathleen also fully reflect the impact of these adjustments. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any questions.And with that, let me turn the call over to Carlos.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you, Christian. And thank you everyone for joining our call. This morning we reported our first quarter fiscal 2020 results with revenue of $3.5 billion for the quarter, up 6% reported and organic constant currency. We are pleased with this revenue growth, which despite some higher than expected unfavorability in FX was in line with our expectations.Our efforts to enhance our operating efficiency along with your focus retention on transformation help us deliver 60 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion for this quarter. This margin expansion was in line with our expectations and we are happy to see the progress that our associates continue to make in helping to improve our productivity, while also improving client satisfaction, particularly given the difficult margin compare given our strong performance in the first half of fiscal 2019.Together with share buybacks and a slightly lower than expected adjusted effective tax rate these results help us deliver 12% adjusted EPS growth this quarter, which was slightly ahead of our expectations.Moving on to Employer Services new business bookings, this quarter we saw solid growth across our US markets, which helped drive 6% growth in the quarter. With regard to our international and multinational sales opportunities, we did see some impact from timing as certain deals that were expected to close this quarter are now expected to close slightly later in the fiscal year. Nevertheless, we are maintaining our full year Employer Services new business bookings guidance of 6% to 8%.Now turning to Client Service. We continue to drive improvements in our client satisfaction scores across our businesses. And this quarter, we were especially pleased with our progress in the upmarket with improvements in both our implementation and overall client satisfaction scores.We continue to take positive steps to transform our service organization and enhance the client experience, and with this continued progress in mind, we remain confident in our forecasted full year fiscal 2020 retention increase of 10 basis points to 20 basis points.We are pleased with our start to fiscal 2020 and with the continued momentum in advancing our strategy to simplify how we do business, deliver innovative solutions for our clients and associates and drive sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders.We understand that a key element of building our success in the market is in the capacity to be agile and to anticipate and adopt to change. Innovation is at the core of this need and it\u2019s a job that's never done. While we are incredibly excited about the solutions, we are delivering in the market today to help clients meet the needs of an evolving workforce, we're even more excited about the future. As the workforce continues to evolve, organizations are looking for ways to manage their entire workforce through a single user experience.Today companies of all sizes are using a variety of applications to get work done. What they need is an open HCM platform that allows easy integration with third-party solutions and is also flexible enough to handle the increasingly dynamic nature of work, one where workers are organized around how work happens in teams, often with individuals working on multiple teams at the same time. Aided by insights from the ADP Research Institute, our Next Gen HCM platform is designed at the core to address these needs.A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to attend the HR Technology conference in Las Vegas where our Next Gen HCM platform and used innovations took center stage. As I met with clients and HR professionals, I was incredibly proud of the reception and recognition that we received for delivering innovative solutions that address how and where work is done today.I was especially proud when our Next Gen HCM platform won both the HR Executive Top HR Product of the year award and the Awesome New Technology award, a remarkable achievement and a testament to ADP's commitment to innovation.Back in September, we also had the opportunity to showcase some of the differentiating features of ADP's Next Gen platform to HCM industry analysts when we hosted our 2019 Industry Analyst Day. At this event, we spent time sharing some of the more meaningful and differentiating elements of our technology, such as, the use of graph database technology that powers the unique ability to dynamically configure teams while enabling actionable data and insights around relationships or our meta data driven design approach that allows solutions to be tailored by the client via local rapid development through a drag-and-drop interface.In addition, our solution was designed from the beginning to be public cloud native. This among other advantages helps improve resiliency and uptime.Finally, our solution is designed to be global. Companies that are expanding globally, or that would like to more effectively manage their existing global workforce are an ideal target for ADP Next Gen HCM.We were equally proud and excited to see, the recognition our efforts from industry experts, at this event. And while it is great to receive these awards and to recognized by industry experts.It is even more rewarding when we see our efforts translate into recognition and acknowledgment from our clients and prospects. As we work to scale our solution and its capabilities, our Next Gen platform is also building momentum in the market and continues to progress in line with our expectations.As an example, earlier this quarter, at our Industry Analyst Day, we shared details of a successful go live with a 6,000 employee U.S. company that chose ADP's Next Gen HCM platform for its talent capabilities. And the ease of the ease of integration with the client's own internally developed on-boarding tool.At the same events, we were also pleased to share that we have recently signed a 65,000-employee global enterprise that was looking for an HCM platform, capable of handling its growing workforce.With that said, our focus on innovation is not limited to our Next Gen HCM platform. We have also increasing the leverage, machine learning to enhance our core strategic advantages in payroll and big data. As an example, we simplified 21 million raw job titles from our unmatched data like, and normalized them down to 2,400 job categories, ultimately enhancing both this functionality and accuracy of our ADP data cloud benchmarking.Customers are using our compensation and HR benchmark data to make substantial changes to their business. For example, one of our clients was able to leverage our turn over benchmark data, to identify opportunities for improvement, and ultimately to reduce their turnover by 20%.While another saw its front line managers use our Executive and Manager Insight\u2019s mobile solution, to help reduce overtime cost by 6%. These equate to real multimillion dollar operational savings that are being enabled by ADP's data and products.Also to enhance the efficiency of our implementation organization, we are designing our NEXT GEN payroll engine to automatically recognize, convert and classify different formats, an input, from prior payrolls and so payroll policies.We believe that this will give us an advantage when we on board new clients, because it will enable the automation of various elements of the implementation process. And allow us to share best practices with our clients.And finally, we also continue to drive innovation for our frontline associates, in an effort to transform how we work, by reducing low value, client contacts, while still delivering value-added service.With this in mind, last year, our support organization and the downmarket rolled out expanded checkbox functionality, which today is capable of handling over 100 different inquiry types for our more than 640,000 small business clients.ADP's unique ability to meet the needs of clients and their workers today while anticipating their needs in the future, have been hallmarks of our success over the past 70 years. And I believe will driver sustained growth in the years to come.And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kathleen, for commentary on our results and fiscal 2020 outlook.\nKathleen Winters: Thank you, Carlos. And good morning, everyone. As Carlos mentioned, we're pleased in transforming our business, in order to simplify, innovate and grow. Our strategy is working, and we are off to a solid start to the year.This morning, we reported first quarter revenue growth in line with our expectation, at 6% on a reported and organic constant currency basis, which includes a slightly greater amount of FX unfavorability than we previously anticipated.Our adjusted EBIT increased 8%, also in line with expectations. And adjusted EBIT margin was up 60 basis points compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We're pleased with this margin improvement, which benefited from cost savings related to our workforce optimization and procurement transformation initiative as well as continued efficiencies within our IT infrastructure.These benefits were partially offset by incremental brand spend as well as selling, amortization and PEO pass-through expenses. This margin performance is particularly gratifying given the difficult margin compare that we faced in the first half of the year.As a reminder, this resulted from the very strong performance in the first half of fiscal 2019, resulting from the outside benefits related to our voluntary early-retirement program due to slower than anticipated plan to backfill at that time.Our adjusted effective tax rate decreased by 100 basis points to 21.2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease was mainly due to an increase in tax incentives related to lower R&D efforts and decreasing reserves from certain tax positions.Adjusted diluted earnings per share were 12% to $1.34. And in addition to benefiting to our benefiting to our revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate was also aided by fewer shares outstanding compared to a year ago.Let\u2019s move now to our Employer Services segment and interest in funds held for client. Employer Services revenues were in line with expectations and grew 4% reported and 5% organic constant currency.Interest income on client funds grew 13% and benefited from a 10 basis point improvement in the average yield earned on our client fund investments to 2.3% and growth in average client fund balances of 7% to $23.7 billion.This growth in balances was driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control partially offset by lower SUI collections. Our Employer Services same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.4% for the first quarter.Employer Services margins saw an increase of 50 basis points from the quarter. The increase in margins this quarter which enabled by the same factors I mentioned earlier when discussing our consolidated results.Our PEO segment revenues grew 8% for the quarter to $1.1 billion with average worksite employees growing 7% to 563,000. Revenues excluding zero margin benefits pass through grew 7% to $358 million and continued to include pressure from lower workers' compensation and SUI costs and related pricing.Margins decreased about 70 basis points for the quarter largely due to changes in ADP Indemnity loss reserve estimates, which drove about 60 basis points of pressure resulting from a smaller benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.As a reminder, with ADP Indemnity results not reported in the PEO, it is normal to expect some volatility in our quarterly PEO margins as a result of changes in our workers' compensation loss reserves.Let's turn to the outlook for the full year and start with a consolidated view. We continued to anticipate total revenue growth of 6% to 7% in fiscal 2020. This revenue outlook assumes a more elevated level of FX on favorability for the remainder of fiscal 2020 relative to our previous expectations.With the recent volatility and overlying fixed interest rates, we now assume interest income on client funds of $570 million to $580 million and interest income from our extended investment strategy is now expected to be $575 million to $585 million.With the continued negative interest rate environment in the Eurozone, we made the decision this quarter to wind down our two Eurozone related client money moving activities in France and the Netherlands.As a result, we have liquidated our Dutch client funds portfolio and we will be liquidating our French client portfolio by the end of fiscal year 2020. We therefore now anticipate our growth and average client funds balances to be about 4%, as compared to our previous forecast of 4% to 5%. This decision is excusive to France and the Netherlands.We continue to anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to expand basis points 100 basis points to 125 basis points. And we now anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 23.3%. The rate includes this quarter's unplanned tax benefit from stock-based compensation related to stock option exercises.It does not however include any further estimated tax benefit related to potential future stock option exercises given the dependency of that benefit on the timing of those exercises. With these slight adjustments to our outlook, we continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 14% in fiscal 2020.Moving on to the segments, let's take a look at Employer Services. We continue to expect 4% to 5% revenue growth in our Employer Services segment. This outlook includes the anticipated impact from my previous remarks regarding changes in FX and adjustments to our interest income on client funds outlook. We continue to anticipate pays per control growth of about 2.5%.We also continue to expect Employer Services new business bookings growth of 6% to 8% and for our Employer Services revenue retention to improve 10 basis points to 20 basis points. I'd like to remind you as I commented in the prior earnings call that there is volatility inherent in the quarterly Employer Services bookings metric from larger international and upmarket deals.And I\u2019d also like to remind you the difficult compare in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 resulting from our strong performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 due in part to a client list acquisition.Moving onto margins. We continue to expect our margin in the Employer Services segment to expand by 100 basis points to 125 basis points. As a reminder with a difficult compare resulting from our strong margin performance in the first half of fiscal 2019, we continue to expect a much stronger margin increase in the latter half of fiscal 2020.Regarding our PEO segment, overall, our outlook remains unchanged. We continue to expect 9% to 11% PEO revenue growth in fiscal 2020 and 7% to 9% growth in PEO revenues excluding zero margin benefit pass-throughs, both driven by an anticipated growth of 7% to 9% in average worksite employees.Because of the slower growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we continue to expect the growth in our average worksite employees to be at the lower end of our guidance range in the first half of the year with a gradual reacceleration of our growth rate as the year progresses.As we also discussed last quarter, we continue to expect lower workers' compensation and SUI cost and related pricing to pressure our total PEO revenue growth. For PEO margin, we continue to anticipate margins to be flat to down 25 basis points in fiscal 2020, which continues to include approximately 50 basis points of pressure from smaller favorable reserve adjustments in ADP Indemnity in fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019.Before I hand the call over for Q&A, I'd like to share that on February 11, we will be hosting an Innovation Day, focused on technology, strategy and showcasing some of her latest innovations.A few of you have had the opportunity to see some of those developments during HR Tech. Others may have had a glimpse from some of the industry analyst notes, and tweets following our September Industry Analyst Day.The February 11th event would be specifically for the investment community, to share our product and service innovation, and have a dialogue around the progress that we continue to make, including how these innovations help to differentiate ADP in the market.We look forward to welcoming you then, and please be on the lookout, for further details in the near future.With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is Damien on for Ramsey. I wanted to ask on the Employer Services bookings guidance. I know you both talked about it at lengths. But I just wanted to see if you could give anymore color on just the quarterly cadence.I know Kathleen you mentioned difficult comps coming up in Q4. But maybe just any granularity that you could give would be great. And then, just overall level of confidence to kind of get to the midpoint of that 6% to 8% guidance?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I'll let maybe Kathleen make a comment as well. But again, I think if you that last year's pattern, our second quarter last year was soft. So that would be the easier compare. And the fourth quarter because of the acquisition of the client base acquisition from Wells Fargo, I think, it'll be a little more difficult.But we obviously try to apply some judgment on these things. And we obviously have information about individual unit performance and kind of what's happening across regions.And I think what we try to provide in some of the color our comments is that this quarter we had very strong, what I would call strong results in our core US businesses, SBS, major accounts and national accounts. And we really had some weakness with international and multinational. And we\u2019ll look into the details of that. There were a few large deals in prior year, as well as some deals that didn't close in the first quarter as expected. So that would give us some confidence that I think, we\u2019re still on track for the year, despite these kind of quarterly fluctuations.Because I think as Kathleen's said, and we said many times for us bookings is certainly more volatile than revenues. Obviously, we have the recurring revenue model. But on bookings the clock goes back to zero at the beginning of every quarter.But we see some underlying strength that gives us some optimism. But we did have some weakness in the international multinational and that is something that we\u2019re looking at. I don't think that it's any major change in the economy, because it\u2019s been kind of a difficult in the economic climate for a while in Europe where we have a large business. So, again as I look at the detail, it just looks like, typical lumpiness in our bookings.\nKathleen Winters: Yeah. I mean just to follow-up on with that. Look you\u2019re always going to have some degree of lumpiness in your quarterly bookings number right, from at least a couple of things, right?If you\u2019ve got larger multinational type deals, that's going to cost some lumpiness. And then you\u2019ve got the year-over-year comps issue and you\u2019ve got a tough comp or an easier comp. So you\u2019ll always have a little bit of that going on. And so importantly, while the quarterly numbers obviously important I think even more important to look at a longer term trend, right?When you look at how we've been doing in particular with last year having a really strong and I think record, right, number of $1.6 billion for last year and then 8%. And then on top of that another what we think is a really solid number of 6% in Q1, when you look at that longer period of time, we\u2019re actually feeling pretty pleased with the start to the year.Now there is of course always pockets that are stronger and others that are maybe a little slower out of the gate and Carlos mentioned on the outside of the US having a little bit of lumpiness there, but net-net we're pretty pleased with the start to the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah. That makes sense, and great. Then maybe I\u2019ll zoom out a little bit and ask on overall sort of product strategy at the large enterprise level. I just wanted to dig in and see how you see your products suite revolving there just sort of in the context of you continuing to invest advantage over time and then your strategy - your new strategy around the Lifion offering.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Don't forget we also again one of the highlights for the quarter and frankly it's been a highlight in trying to kind of signal this. I am not sure how it has landed yet, but our decision to use Workforce Now with the lower end of the upmarket, so call it that 1,000 to 3,000 even though frankly it can go higher. We have a couple of clients that have 8, 9,000 employees that are on Workforce Now. But that decision has been great competitively in growth wise. So we are selling a lot of units in that kind of lower end of the upmarket.So the ability to use Workforce Now for - and it fits certain types of profiles clients and you can probably imagine generally speaking they are large, but simpler and Vantage clients would be more complex and have more complex needs like complex benefits and talent requirements and so forth.And Lifion it\u2019s still obviously an early adopter type of product, even though we're getting great traction and we told you what - how we've done in terms of new sales given the size of ADP, it\u2019s really Workforce Now and Vantage Now that are affecting the numbers in terms of the bookings and the revenue. And I think again in case I wasn't clear like that we had a good quarter even in national accounts in the upmarket primarily as a result of really good results from Workforce Now.So the strategy is the same strategy we\u2019ve had all along, which is I think we\u2019ve figured out that we have a really great solution for a segment of the market. I think last quarter, I mentioned that we have an external third-party do some analysis for us and in terms of segmenting the market, and as usual one solution doesn't fit the entire market. And what we found was that a pretty good size percentage of the market can be addressed by our Workforce Now solutions and that's what we're doing.And we were right. And the analysis was right. And we think the Vantage still addresses another segment of the market and Lifion is more kind of the emerging solution that we obviously have placed a lot of confidence and a lot of a - and a big bet on for the future. But as of today it's really not having a big impact on the numbers.And I also just in terms of just your question about market dynamic when we had this meeting in Las Vegas at the HR Tech Conference that I mentioned in my comments again, early positive signs we had for anyone who was there, I think some of our \u2013 some industry analysts and some financial analysts were there, I think, it was pretty clear that we are making an impact in the market. So our lead flow was multiples of what it has been in the past in the upmarket because of the interest in Lifion.But I just want to be cautious in terms of pace here because relative to our $15 billion in revenue, this is not next quarter or three quarters from now. But the signs are very, very positive in the long-term as Kathleen mentioned. If you focus on the long-term, I think, Lifion - the traction we're getting in Lifion is very, very encouraging.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah. That's, that's really good. We'll keep watching. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thank you. Hey, you\u2019re able to reaffirm the revenue despite the lower client interest on kind of funds and extended investment. Was there any kind of offset there particularly given the incremental headwinds and FX? It seems like you're able to reaffirm the guide despite those couple of headwinds.\nCarlos Rodriguez: You know, I think, it goes back to what we're saying about the some of the underlying performance of the business. So as an example, even though we don't give quarterly guidance on retention, you could tell from our comments, I hope that we felt pretty good about it this quarter, so that you could probably read into that it improved prior to - compared to last year's prior first quarter.And as I mentioned before retention if you do the math has a pretty outside impact on our business bookings in terms of revenue and frankly big impact on margin because for equal growth you don't have to implement as much business.And so there's a lot of different moving parts that go into the pot here, but I would point that one out as an area of strength. I think we've talked about the strong performance in our core U.S. businesses.So for the first quarter we had kind of our three core businesses performing very well in terms of bookings as well. So it's a process from the ground up of us building this forecast, first of plan and now the forecast and I think we have some optimism that we're still in that range.And but I just want to point out the retention story because three or four years ago when it was going the other way, I pointed out that it takes four to five points of sales growth of new business bookings growth to offset one point of retention just because of the way the math works. And so - now as retention - as you get a little bit of improvement in retention that helps a lot in terms of our growth rate.\nKathleen Winters: Yes. So as Carlos mentioned there's a couple of things that obviously gave us some headwind or unfavorably versus what we would have been expecting particularly the FX and the interest from client funds. However, when you look at operationally the fundamentals things look really good.As Carlos said retention is on a steady track upwards now gets harder and harder the higher up you go. But we're happy to see some level of increase in the first quarter here, and bookings were solid for the quarter.\nCarlos Rodriguez: And I would just add on the client funds interest, we do have some of this - for the year it obviously has an impact as we guided - we gave you the information in terms of we are slightly below what we expected to be, but it's not a huge number for this fiscal year.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. And then just Carlos to highlight the retention a little bit more because obviously really nice progress there. Any sense of just the success across the enterprise versus the mid-market versus kind of downstream a little bit the range on those?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes. I do have some sense. My sense is that, we're improving a lot. So we show some signs in terms of the win-loss, what we call balance of the trade, some encouraging signs particularly in our mid-market business.So again the mid-market now is performing - you got to be cautious because there's definitely a forward-looking statement. But it's performing according to the script, in the sense if you remember we took a lot of pain and lot of effort to migrate all of our clients on to one single strategic platform which is Workforce Now.And when you look at the history of what happened in our SBS downmarket business. When we did that, we were optimistic and hopeful that we would have the same kind of traction in our mid-market business. And it's beginning to show now.So we have improving retention now for it feels like six or seven quarters somewhere in that range. I am being told more. So once we kind of finish the migration and got through that difficulty. I think we have steady improvements in retention.This quarter was the second highest retention we've ever had, in our mid-market business. And in this quarter what was very encouraging is to see the level of activity in new business bookings. So, the combination of those two things gives us a feeling of optimism for what is - one of biggest and more profitable businesses.\nKevin McVeigh: Awesome, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Could you comment on, the drivers that you expect to move your PEO revenue growth up from 8% in the recent quarter to 9% to 11% which is your guide for this year?And then, just as a follow-up at your Analyst Day last year you gave a multiyear guide of 12% to 14%, CAGR for your HRO business, and you're trending well below that now. Did you anticipate the time that the growth rates in the earlier year\u2019s double-digits effectively, would slow towards the end of that period? Let's say, mid- to high single digits?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well if I can start with the second one first, since I was there in the analysts and not fair to ask Kathleen. I think we have built the guidance for or I guess the estimates for are three years. We had as I think we've mentioned this couple of times, we had certain expectations around our pass through revenue and inflation of those numbers that had some historical precedent, both around workers compensation and health care.And I think literally within two months of that, the picture changed, and we communicated that very clearly and very transparently and frankly, without any anxiety because it doesn't have any impact in our EPS. So if you remember the Investor Day, I think it June and I think when we had our August earnings call, I think, we brought down significantly for that year at least, the growth rate for the PEO mainly - primarily close to almost based on lower inflation.Now on top of that, we have had some slowdown in worksite employee growth, which is the core driver underneath of the real growth of the business. But I think a main driver of this differential from what we communicated at our Investor Day has been has been the lower inflation of the pass-through, which again doesn't concern us, in a big way because it\u2019s zero margin and doesn't really affect our profitability in terms of in terms of dollars.In terms of your question about the behavior of the quarters and so forth, probably beyond the scope of this call but, it's just kind of math in terms of when we have our open enrollment for healthcare in kind of May, June timeframe which we\u2019ve again communicated very transparently when that happens and what happens when that occurs, you tend to have some client churn.So that drops your worksite employee growth and obviously revenue growth for the PEO. And then as bookings continue to - assuming they continue to be robust, you start to build that up again. And then at the end of the calendar year-end, you have another event at year end where you have some churn in the client base in terms of clients that choose to leave at the end of the calendar year because that's more natural, but we also have historically a lot of bookings in January as well.So we've been doing this for 20 years and we see a difference or a change we would obviously communicate that. But I think we're just kind of dropping the numbers in as they are supposed to come in terms of -- based on historical trends.And David I would just add, so last quarter we did say that we would expect to start a year from the lower end of the range and then grow into the range as the year progresses because obviously, we started with a somewhat of a weaker ending worksite employee number in the fourth quarter last year.\nChristian Greyenbuhl: And I think it's probably worth asking I mean, adding just again in full transparency, I think we said it last quarter our health care renewal was slightly higher than the previous year. So I wouldn't - it wasn't anything out of norm in terms of historical, but it was higher than the previous yearAnd when that - when we have that happen you tend to get more shoppers and more -- health care cause is a large part of what a small business pays in their overall cost structure of their workforce. And so they tend to shop and look around and so forth, and so we have a little bit more churn than I think that we have had in the prior year.The good news is for us is that we have that issue, but we've been dealing with that for 20 years, but we don\u2019t think any risk on health care. So whatever we get in terms of price increases through the carriers, we pass those through 100% which is why we call zero margin pass-through.So that eliminates any risk or any surprises in the future, but it also means that you have to have frankly the courage to just pass those costs through and let the chips fall where they may.And the chips fell and I think you can see from the numbers that the chips didn't fall off the table, because there wasn't a collapse in the because of a huge slowdown, but we definitely had our speed bump and now it's really through new business bookings that we have to regain the momentum and kind of have that ramp up again and reacceleration of the growth rate.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Your line is open.\nBryan Bergin: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Carlos, wanted to ask your macro outlook on the current employment market. It sounds encouraging based on the performance of the business, but I'm curious how much of that is due to the improved competitive product position versus the underlying demand you might be saying?\nCarlos Rodriguez: It's a great question because it's an important one for us to keep kind of asking ourselves, we do have some things that you know if they turn on us would put pressure on us, interest rates obviously is one of them, pays per control, et cetera.But we're also feeling pretty good about our product situation and I think our competitive situation in the marketplace going forward here. So it is -- that's going to be a very important question for us to stay focused on here for the next few quartersBut as of today, when you look at our lagging indicators so pays per control, it doesn't look like there's a slow down or a big issue, but if you look at the same things that everyone else would look at that we have access to and you have access to in terms of leading indicators like confidence indexes or NFIB/ISM - those types of things Michigan confidence.You know those, there\u2019s some concern there and some reason for caution. In our numbers, the only place where we have seen some little bit of softness and pace for control and it doesn't get reflected in our and what we report because as we've disclosed prior this is our Autopay base which is a very large base of both large employers, midsize employers and smaller employers.But we have most of our employer in our run platform and there we've seen a slight down tick in pays per control growth over the prior year. It doesn't - when you look at over the 10-year history, I don't think it's anything to be alarmed by, but - when you look at other factors it certainly a cause for caution. I just happened to look I think, in the last couple of days at NFIB and that's softened significantly, but it's still well above recession levels.And so I think we\u2019re all kind of trying to figure out the same thing here which is a soft patch or is it kind of a trend line. But with - the Fed easing and the consumer still strong like right now our plans are that we kind of work our way through this soft patch.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. That's helpful. And then Kathleen on just margin expansion progress, any further details you can share on the various transformation initiatives? And as you look across the various resources were you seeing the most yield, and anything surprising you as you've had just more time in the seat?\nKathleen Winters: Yes. Thanks for the question. Obviously, something that I'm really focused on in the organization is really very focused on as well. I mean just to kind of get some context and kind of big picture when you step back and take a look at what we've done in the last couple of years.I mean remember back in 2018, we were at margin rate of 20.7%, with a small amount of margin expansion in that year and then in 2019 when -- fiscal 2019, when we were executing on some really big and meaningful transformation initiatives.You saw that really outsized margin expansion of 160 basis points, and know -- as a reminder the guide for another 100 basis points to 125 basis points for fiscal 2020.So a track record here really consistent margin expansion. And as we start in fiscal 2020 with Q1 that 60 basis points of margin expansion we're really happy to see that and very happy that we're on track with how we planned the year.Now there's a lot of execution and a lot of work behind the scenes going on but I'd point out that number one as I started my comment there's a lot of energy around it and a lot of alignment. And that energy and alignment is around both executing what I call in-flight projects as well as developing the pipeline for the future. So that's really exciting.I talked about on the previous call that most of the margin expansion from a transformation perspective this year is coming from what we're calling workforce optimization and procurement initiatives both are very much on track from a workforce optimization standpoint.Think about that in terms of spans and layers exercise if you will and particularly targeted to management layers. So that's kind of on track and already executed with most of that benefit being in fiscal 2020 not much from that coming beyond fiscal 2020.And then procurement transformation there's a lot of projects there as we look at - across all parts of the organization and spend as we look at volume and we look at policy and we look at our ability to negotiate smartly with vendors and suppliers. There is opportunity there and there is a lot of execution going on.So a lot of work execution going on. So, a lot of work by the organization, we're happy with what the teams are currently doing and happy with the progress, but more to do.\nBryan Bergin: Thank you.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Hi, Brian. I just - one thing just to add, as you think about the margin because your question I think was related to margins in particular. And obviously what's driving those. But last year, the first and second quarter but particularly the second quarter was a very strong growth in margin in that time.And just a reminder, we also had pressure from M&A at that time. So, just layer that one on to it as well when you think about margin cadence last year versus this year.\nBryan Bergin: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Grossman from Stifel. Your line is open.\nDavid Grossman: Thank you. Good morning. I wonder if I could just follow-up with a couple of questions on the PEO. Each of your kind of larger peers in that space have identified some type of incremental issue with their health insurance book in their most recent reports.And I know you mentioned, just higher health premiums and obviously you pass everything through in your model. But is there anything else, you're seeing in the market place that may be impacting the cost of delivering health insurance in the PEO industry?\nCarlos Rodriguez: No.\nDavid Grossman: All right. So for you, it's just the straight higher premium and not seeing anything else? I guess, you don't really see the claim that is around in terms of how claims may be impacting on a cost?\nCarlos Rodriguez: You will see individual employee, claims data but we of course very, very carefully looking at claims data to get some sense with our carriers and partnership with our carriers, what's happening in terms of trends.Maybe I should be a little bit more, clear on this, premium increase issue. So, I'm not going to give you the exact numbers. I don't think we want to get down that rabbit hole. But the change from this renewal to the prior renewal was call it one to two percentage points higher, on average than the prior year. So if, the previous year the average renewal increase was 6% then the next year it was it was it was 7% or 8%.And that increase that year that was slightly higher was completely in line with the prior six or seven years. So it wasn't -- so there are some ups and downs. But the prior year was one that was actually exceptional. I think we were very clear about that. I think we talked about that in our calls, that we had a really great renewal on our health care on average I remember this is not one carrier. These are multiple carriers.We use a number of different carriers to make sure we have good coverage across the entire country. And so, that was unusual. And it helped us competitively. But I think this renewal was not out of line with historical norms and has nothing to do with any of that.I think anything that's happening around health care this probably has to do with people's underwriting policies and their own approach to bringing in business and repricing business, because it's not just about the business you bring in.But every year if you're self-insured or you're taking risk, you have the opportunity or the option of passing through or not passing through health care costs. And you actually have some judgment with your underwriters on what those costs are.And so that's generally typically what could create a problem in health care. But it doesn't appear to us that there's really anything happening broadly in the health care industry around PEOs.\nDavid Grossman: And then just on your, just based on your commentary on workers comp. I mean I think the whole industry had a tailwind. So, if you look at this year's health increase plus the workers comp at a more normalized level, this is really a more typical year for you then right, I mean in terms of the PEO, in terms of those two items?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think that's right. That's fair. And I think on the workers comp, just again to be clear was a -- I think we were clear, but why don\u2019t we say one more time, a smaller positive. So we're not having big surprises in terms of losses in workers comp or any kind of. And by the way we have very tight ship there in a sense that we have as we disclose in our 10-K, a collar that limits our risk in a fairly significant way. Caps are down side on workers comp. So we have reinsurance an individual claim and then we have a collar around overall loss estimates. So it's quite limited in terms of the volatility.I think the other thing that I would mention is that our business mix hasn't changed, so we look at that very carefully as well. So we looked at the mix of we call it white collar versus gray collar, but within those categories you have a lot of different industries and a lot of different categories of people and we don't see any major change there as well.\nDavid Grossman: Got it. And just as a follow-up, is kind of a bigger picture for you question Carlos is that given a relatively low penetration rates for the industry and that you get a lot of your new clients from a client that is already using you for payroll.What are the major objections to somebody enrolling in the PEO particularly if they're an ADP payroll customer and you already have the payroll records so it kind of disruption and transition cost time and effort are substantially lower?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think it's - it goes back to like my first year marketing class in graduate school, which is high involvement decision, right. So the PEO to go to a small midsize business and tell them that you're going to create a co-employment relationship, you're taking over there healthcare plan, there\u2019s workers' compensation remember all along the way there are as an example that could be a relationship with insurance agent or a broker that's been providing to health care in the workers comp for the last 10 years that gets this intermediated.You have to - payroll is hard enough to convince some of the payroll because people worry about \u2013 are you sure you are not going to make a mistake and make sure that it's going to go accurately, we obviously have an incredibly strong reputation on payroll that helps us.But the traditional business is you\u2019re trying to convince someone to give you your payroll, now you're also trying to convince them to give you everything around their HR department.And so it's with a higher level of trust and it's again what I remember being taught is called a high involvement decision, which takes longer to make and is more difficult to make.So I honestly don't think that there is really anything that prevents clients from becoming PEO clients. And I think we've demonstrated over 20 years that we've convinced a lot of them.And so our board asks the same question you're asking, which can't you convince even more. And we're trying. Like, we continue to add improvements in the product. We continue to provide better tools. We continue to enhance our product. We continue to do all the things we can to make it more compelling and easier to use.As an example, I think we've kind of talked about this in the last 18 months, all new business now and the PEO starting in our Workforce Now platform which has higher functionality and provides the ability to satisfy slightly larger clients than we could before because it's a mid-market platform.And so there is a lot of things that we're doing to try to convince as many clients to come over to our PEO solution as possible. I think it's good for them and it's good for them and it's good for us but there's really nothing that I can point to other than kind of the difficulties of the convincing of the sale.\nDavid Grossman: I got it. Very helpful. Thank you for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to pick-up on some of the margin commentary. I mean, as you rightfully pointed out the comparison there gets quite a bit harder actually in the second quarter. So just so that our expectations are properly calibrated. I mean do you expect margins to be up in the second quarter year-over-year?\nKathleen Winters: Yes. It's a really tough comp in Q2. Remember last fiscal year Q2, we had over 300 basis points of margin expansion. So it was going to be tough to expand in Q2. Maybe it's flat to slightly up slightly down. You know, hard to say exactly because there's so many moving parts.But the way I would think about is that the bulk of the expansion to come this fiscal year will come in the second half of the year.\nJason Kupferberg: Yes. Okay. That's fair. I mean just on the bookings front somewhat similar question except in reverse right? Because you\u2019ve got the easy comp there in the second quarter. So do you need to be above the full year guidance range in the second quarter just to make sure that you stay on track to achieve the full year outlook? Because then obviously the comparisons here get a bit harder in the second half?\nKathleen Winters: Above the bookings guidance number in the second quarter?\nJason Kupferberg: You need to be above the full year range in Q2 just to keep yourself on track?\nKathleen Winters: Mathematically, yes. So you're absolutely right. I mean it\u2019s to stay on that for the full year you\u2019ll have more growth in the second quarter and then much less in Q4.\nJason Kupferberg: Right, right okay. And then just last quick one from me. What would be the drivers of the anticipated acceleration in the WSE growth during the balance of fiscal 2020?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Selling more new clients than losing clients. It really goes back to the - I mean, I hate to I'm not trying to be a smart [indiscernible] but the it's really the pattern, I think, I talked about it a couple of questions ago that when we tell our open enrollment in May and June, we tend to experience some client turn. The sales don't accelerate necessarily at the same necessarily at the same time.And so you have seen that phenomenon happens sometimes at the end of the calendar year where you may lose a group of clients and then you bring on new clients at the beginning of the year, but then you also bring on - so clients tend to not leave at other times of year other than calendar year end and open enrollment which is May and June.That doesn't mean non leave, I'm just saying that the skewing is cued towards those two periods. And the sales are skewed differently. And the combination of those two things is what causes either growth or deceleration in worksite employee growth.\nKathleen Winters: Yes. Look on - any of the not any but like a lot of these metrics when you look at a very short period of time one quarter \u2013 you could have some one-off things happening. I saw - as I said earlier looking at these trends and a track record over time for things like bookings and worksite employee growth and even margin, right? Looking at the trend over time is helpful I find.\nCarlos Rodriguez: But again in this case we also have - we have to hit our plan, obviously. I guess as usual when we have these calls, if we are giving you the numbers based on what we expect right now. So if we hit our new business bookings plans and retentions stays when we expected to stay then you would get the outcomes that we're talking about.But as Kathleen said, there's a lot of moving parts if three to six months from now, the economies in the tank and pays per control is declining, it's going to in the PEO in addition to ES and it less than ADP and that would create a headwind. But in the absence of any new information I think, we feel pretty good about the forecast we have.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Wald from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSteven Wald: Hey, good morning. Just maybe a follow-up a on the margin expansion path, looking beyond, sort of the next few quarters or even this year, I just wanted to talk about the messaging. And make sure we were getting a proper sense of the drivers there.I think a lot of the talk has been around workforce optimization and procurement over the next 12 months or so. But I think, one of the things you guys try to talk about is the tech improvements or your investments.As you build more this into your platform, as you're add even more into what you are doing on a day-to-day basis. Can you talk a little bit about, how that scale to you're adding or that scalable expense base that you're adding will show up in terms of cost reductions or margin improvement?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, I think again back to like what Kathleen was talking about in terms of the math, some of it was really comparisons rather than anything that we're doing. And but we have to help people. We understand that it's important for you guys to understand that.So, just as a reminder last year what happened was, we had with the voluntary early retirement program, we had a good number of people taking that. And then the back fills that we had planned which was all planned, certain percentage of back fills were delayed.And so that impacted that year. We also got off to a very strong start for a couple of other reasons. We had other what we called quick wins at a time around transformation that help us get off to a strong start in the first half.And I think Kathleen talked about -- we had for us, like incredibly strong margin improvement. And so it's just a very difficult compare mathematically. As we've been going along, regardless of how the math works, we continue to work on a number of initiatives.And this year obviously we executed on this expand the layers initiative, and then we have a number of other projects around procurement is one of them but we also have a number kind of automation and digitization project that I think we're making some progress on. And when we have our industry - sorry our Analyst Day in February, we'll probably share a little bit more around some of those things that we're doing, because those are around transformation and innovation as well. So it's not just about innovating on the product side. But it's also innovating on the implementation and on the service side.And we\u2019ve gotten some good traction in some of our businesses which are allows our productivity to improve while, still for our associates. While still improving our NPS scores and our client satisfaction which by the way were up again this quarter and no surprise the retention is improving.It\u2019s usually a sign that client satisfaction is still high. So again trick here is you want to transform your cost structure, but you don't want to like lose all the clients in the meantime. And for now, we've been able to balance both of those and that's our plan here for the next year or two.\nSteven Wald: Yes. Fair enough. And then, maybe just one quick follow-up, I noticed the buy back a little bit higher than we\u2019ve seen last year or so. Just could you provide any commentary on how you're thinking about the pace there going forward?\nKathleen Winters: Yes. So really no change in terms of how we're thinking about that. And our strategy we talked about the intent to buy back 1% of the share base. And we've been executing along those lines, so, really no change.We look all the time at the market conditions and look if there is some opportunity where there is a big downturn in the market and we want to become more active. Maybe we'll do that, I don't know. But constantly we watch that, we look at it, we talked about it all the time, but as of now no particular change.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Again, one little statistic, because we happen to notice these things when we prepare for these calls. Because now I get like seems like 20 years of information, so we\u2019ve reduced our share count by 30% since the early 2000\u2019s, and so we intend to continue to stay on that pace.And so obviously it's a marathon for a company like we're kind of proud that it's a marathon we've been around for seven years. And at 1% per year it adds up. And it certainly has added up in the last 20 years to the tune of a 30% share reduction.And I think that companies are in the different stage of development whether they're getting dilution and adding shares to their share count. We think we're going to win this marathon.\nSteven Wald: All right. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll take our final question from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Just a quick - two quick clarifications. On the PEO margins it was below street, but it didn't sound like it was really below your expectations. And it sounds like there was a tougher comp to the ADP Indemnity. So could maybe just talk to that and how that looks going forward on the margin side?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yeah. No, I think that's a fair characterization. I think that as usual there\u2019s \u2013 and we try to obviously be as straight as we can be because sometimes there is a slight disconnect between what we\u2019re expecting versus since we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance. But the results I think were on that specific topic, I think we're in line with our expectations.\nKathleen Winters: Yeah. It was definitely in line with how we expect to start the year.\nBryan Keane: And then just the cadence how we think about that going forward on the margin for PEO?\nCarlos Rodriguez: That's a good question. I think that when you look at the annual guidance, I think it was down flat to 25 down\u2026\nKathleen Winters: Down 25 basis points.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Down to 25 basis points. I think that was the guidance. If you take our first quarter number, I would for now assume ratably margin improvement over the course of the rest of the year because these quarterly fluctuations in ADP Indemnity are not something that is - something that we can have a - we don't have any real visibility into that.And again, just as a reminder, part of why we've done this is, if you remember a couple of years ago, we had some criticism around our disclosures. So we had our client funds interest and Indemnity being handled in the kind of other category, which allowed us to not have these questions and not kind of makes up the results of those businesses.But as usual, there are two sides to every story. And so I think the criticism was those things really belong and the results of the business unit. Fair enough. So we made that change and now we are saddled with every quarter having to explain any kind of fluctuations here, because what really matters is the underlying health of the business.We don\u2019t take enough risk in that business for it to matter. But you can get because of the size of the business, if you get a $5 million fluctuation which is what we had this quarter up or down, it affects the numbers, but it doesn't really say anything about what's happening in the underlying business.But it is what it is. We now report Indemnity in the PEO and we\u2019re going to have to every quarter be able to give you that kind of color. And likewise in Employer Services we now have client funds interest. And so now that creates some variability in that business as well.\nKathleen Winters: Yeah, so with the down - with the flat to down 25 basis points and down 70 in Q1 you'll see that just mathematically it ramps. But again it's going to depend on the ADP Indemnity and how that comes through during the balance of the year.\nCarlos Rodriguez: It was certainly easier when we didn't have ADP Indemnity in the PEO. But because nothing -- we've been doing that for 20 years. We've handled it. We\u2019re not by the way we are handling exactly the same way we\u2019ve always handled it. It\u2019s just a different accounting report. That's all.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude our question-and-answer portion for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, thanks very much. You can tell we feel pretty good about the start to 2020. We're obviously trying to change a lot of things. We\u2019ve talked a lot about transformation. We'll share more with you when we have our Innovation Day here in February.But we\u2019re focused on execution as I think Kathleen alluded to this there's still a lot of execution in front of us. But we still - we try continue to be focused on our clients and our associates. And our associates are doing a phenomenal job as evidenced by our continuing improvements in our NPS scores.Obviously, we felt good about what happened with HR Tech, with our Lifion debut. So I think that gives us some optimism. We're very excited about what's happening in the mid-market business here in the first quarter.So I - continue to be very proud of our organization and the resiliency of the organization and the transformation efforts that they continue to execute on. So we look forward to giving you more updates in the time to come. And we thank you for joining our call today. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Kathleen Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Carlos. And good morning, everyone. As Carlos mentioned, we're pleased in transforming our business, in order to simplify, innovate and grow. Our strategy is working, and we are off to a solid start to the year.This morning, we reported first quarter revenue growth in line with our expectation, at 6% on a reported and organic constant currency basis, which includes a slightly greater amount of FX unfavorability than we previously anticipated.Our adjusted EBIT increased 8%, also in line with expectations. And adjusted EBIT margin was up 60 basis points compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. We're pleased with this margin improvement, which benefited from cost savings related to our workforce optimization and procurement transformation initiative as well as continued efficiencies within our IT infrastructure.These benefits were partially offset by incremental brand spend as well as selling, amortization and PEO pass-through expenses. This margin performance is particularly gratifying given the difficult margin compare that we faced in the first half of the year.As a reminder, this resulted from the very strong performance in the first half of fiscal 2019, resulting from the outside benefits related to our voluntary early-retirement program due to slower than anticipated plan to backfill at that time.Our adjusted effective tax rate decreased by 100 basis points to 21.2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The decrease was mainly due to an increase in tax incentives related to lower R&D efforts and decreasing reserves from certain tax positions.Adjusted diluted earnings per share were 12% to $1.34. And in addition to benefiting to our benefiting to our revenue growth, margin expansion and a lower effective tax rate was also aided by fewer shares outstanding compared to a year ago.Let\u2019s move now to our Employer Services segment and interest in funds held for client. Employer Services revenues were in line with expectations and grew 4% reported and 5% organic constant currency.Interest income on client funds grew 13% and benefited from a 10 basis point improvement in the average yield earned on our client fund investments to 2.3% and growth in average client fund balances of 7% to $23.7 billion.This growth in balances was driven by a combination of client growth, wage inflation and growth in our pays per control partially offset by lower SUI collections. Our Employer Services same-store pays per control metric in the U.S. grew 2.4% for the first quarter.Employer Services margins saw an increase of 50 basis points from the quarter. The increase in margins this quarter which enabled by the same factors I mentioned earlier when discussing our consolidated results.Our PEO segment revenues grew 8% for the quarter to $1.1 billion with average worksite employees growing 7% to 563,000. Revenues excluding zero margin benefits pass through grew 7% to $358 million and continued to include pressure from lower workers' compensation and SUI costs and related pricing.Margins decreased about 70 basis points for the quarter largely due to changes in ADP Indemnity loss reserve estimates, which drove about 60 basis points of pressure resulting from a smaller benefit in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019.As a reminder, with ADP Indemnity results not reported in the PEO, it is normal to expect some volatility in our quarterly PEO margins as a result of changes in our workers' compensation loss reserves.Let's turn to the outlook for the full year and start with a consolidated view. We continued to anticipate total revenue growth of 6% to 7% in fiscal 2020. This revenue outlook assumes a more elevated level of FX on favorability for the remainder of fiscal 2020 relative to our previous expectations.With the recent volatility and overlying fixed interest rates, we now assume interest income on client funds of $570 million to $580 million and interest income from our extended investment strategy is now expected to be $575 million to $585 million.With the continued negative interest rate environment in the Eurozone, we made the decision this quarter to wind down our two Eurozone related client money moving activities in France and the Netherlands.As a result, we have liquidated our Dutch client funds portfolio and we will be liquidating our French client portfolio by the end of fiscal year 2020. We therefore now anticipate our growth and average client funds balances to be about 4%, as compared to our previous forecast of 4% to 5%. This decision is excusive to France and the Netherlands.We continue to anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to expand basis points 100 basis points to 125 basis points. And we now anticipate our adjusted effective tax rate to be 23.3%. The rate includes this quarter's unplanned tax benefit from stock-based compensation related to stock option exercises.It does not however include any further estimated tax benefit related to potential future stock option exercises given the dependency of that benefit on the timing of those exercises. With these slight adjustments to our outlook, we continue to expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow 12% to 14% in fiscal 2020.Moving on to the segments, let's take a look at Employer Services. We continue to expect 4% to 5% revenue growth in our Employer Services segment. This outlook includes the anticipated impact from my previous remarks regarding changes in FX and adjustments to our interest income on client funds outlook. We continue to anticipate pays per control growth of about 2.5%.We also continue to expect Employer Services new business bookings growth of 6% to 8% and for our Employer Services revenue retention to improve 10 basis points to 20 basis points. I'd like to remind you as I commented in the prior earnings call that there is volatility inherent in the quarterly Employer Services bookings metric from larger international and upmarket deals.And I\u2019d also like to remind you the difficult compare in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 resulting from our strong performance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 due in part to a client list acquisition.Moving onto margins. We continue to expect our margin in the Employer Services segment to expand by 100 basis points to 125 basis points. As a reminder with a difficult compare resulting from our strong margin performance in the first half of fiscal 2019, we continue to expect a much stronger margin increase in the latter half of fiscal 2020.Regarding our PEO segment, overall, our outlook remains unchanged. We continue to expect 9% to 11% PEO revenue growth in fiscal 2020 and 7% to 9% growth in PEO revenues excluding zero margin benefit pass-throughs, both driven by an anticipated growth of 7% to 9% in average worksite employees.Because of the slower growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we continue to expect the growth in our average worksite employees to be at the lower end of our guidance range in the first half of the year with a gradual reacceleration of our growth rate as the year progresses.As we also discussed last quarter, we continue to expect lower workers' compensation and SUI cost and related pricing to pressure our total PEO revenue growth. For PEO margin, we continue to anticipate margins to be flat to down 25 basis points in fiscal 2020, which continues to include approximately 50 basis points of pressure from smaller favorable reserve adjustments in ADP Indemnity in fiscal 2020, compared to fiscal 2019.Before I hand the call over for Q&A, I'd like to share that on February 11, we will be hosting an Innovation Day, focused on technology, strategy and showcasing some of her latest innovations.A few of you have had the opportunity to see some of those developments during HR Tech. Others may have had a glimpse from some of the industry analyst notes, and tweets following our September Industry Analyst Day.The February 11th event would be specifically for the investment community, to share our product and service innovation, and have a dialogue around the progress that we continue to make, including how these innovations help to differentiate ADP in the market.We look forward to welcoming you then, and please be on the lookout, for further details in the near future.With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator to take your questions. Yeah. I mean just to follow-up on with that. Look you\u2019re always going to have some degree of lumpiness in your quarterly bookings number right, from at least a couple of things, right?If you\u2019ve got larger multinational type deals, that's going to cost some lumpiness. And then you\u2019ve got the year-over-year comps issue and you\u2019ve got a tough comp or an easier comp. So you\u2019ll always have a little bit of that going on. And so importantly, while the quarterly numbers obviously important I think even more important to look at a longer term trend, right?When you look at how we've been doing in particular with last year having a really strong and I think record, right, number of $1.6 billion for last year and then 8%. And then on top of that another what we think is a really solid number of 6% in Q1, when you look at that longer period of time, we\u2019re actually feeling pretty pleased with the start to the year.Now there is of course always pockets that are stronger and others that are maybe a little slower out of the gate and Carlos mentioned on the outside of the US having a little bit of lumpiness there, but net-net we're pretty pleased with the start to the year. Yes. So as Carlos mentioned there's a couple of things that obviously gave us some headwind or unfavorably versus what we would have been expecting particularly the FX and the interest from client funds. However, when you look at operationally the fundamentals things look really good.As Carlos said retention is on a steady track upwards now gets harder and harder the higher up you go. But we're happy to see some level of increase in the first quarter here, and bookings were solid for the quarter. Yes. Thanks for the question. Obviously, something that I'm really focused on in the organization is really very focused on as well. I mean just to kind of get some context and kind of big picture when you step back and take a look at what we've done in the last couple of years.I mean remember back in 2018, we were at margin rate of 20.7%, with a small amount of margin expansion in that year and then in 2019 when -- fiscal 2019, when we were executing on some really big and meaningful transformation initiatives.You saw that really outsized margin expansion of 160 basis points, and know -- as a reminder the guide for another 100 basis points to 125 basis points for fiscal 2020.So a track record here really consistent margin expansion. And as we start in fiscal 2020 with Q1 that 60 basis points of margin expansion we're really happy to see that and very happy that we're on track with how we planned the year.Now there's a lot of execution and a lot of work behind the scenes going on but I'd point out that number one as I started my comment there's a lot of energy around it and a lot of alignment. And that energy and alignment is around both executing what I call in-flight projects as well as developing the pipeline for the future. So that's really exciting.I talked about on the previous call that most of the margin expansion from a transformation perspective this year is coming from what we're calling workforce optimization and procurement initiatives both are very much on track from a workforce optimization standpoint.Think about that in terms of spans and layers exercise if you will and particularly targeted to management layers. So that's kind of on track and already executed with most of that benefit being in fiscal 2020 not much from that coming beyond fiscal 2020.And then procurement transformation there's a lot of projects there as we look at - across all parts of the organization and spend as we look at volume and we look at policy and we look at our ability to negotiate smartly with vendors and suppliers. There is opportunity there and there is a lot of execution going on.So a lot of work execution going on. So, a lot of work by the organization, we're happy with what the teams are currently doing and happy with the progress, but more to do. Yes. It's a really tough comp in Q2. Remember last fiscal year Q2, we had over 300 basis points of margin expansion. So it was going to be tough to expand in Q2. Maybe it's flat to slightly up slightly down. You know, hard to say exactly because there's so many moving parts.But the way I would think about is that the bulk of the expansion to come this fiscal year will come in the second half of the year. Above the bookings guidance number in the second quarter? Mathematically, yes. So you're absolutely right. I mean it\u2019s to stay on that for the full year you\u2019ll have more growth in the second quarter and then much less in Q4. Yes. Look on - any of the not any but like a lot of these metrics when you look at a very short period of time one quarter \u2013 you could have some one-off things happening. I saw - as I said earlier looking at these trends and a track record over time for things like bookings and worksite employee growth and even margin, right? Looking at the trend over time is helpful I find. Yes. So really no change in terms of how we're thinking about that. And our strategy we talked about the intent to buy back 1% of the share base. And we've been executing along those lines, so, really no change.We look all the time at the market conditions and look if there is some opportunity where there is a big downturn in the market and we want to become more active. Maybe we'll do that, I don't know. But constantly we watch that, we look at it, we talked about it all the time, but as of now no particular change. Yeah. It was definitely in line with how we expect to start the year. Down 25 basis points. Yeah, so with the down - with the flat to down 25 basis points and down 70 in Q1 you'll see that just mathematically it ramps. But again it's going to depend on the ADP Indemnity and how that comes through during the balance of the year."

            "content": "Thank you, Christian. And thank you everyone for joining our call. This morning we reported our first quarter fiscal 2020 results with revenue of $3.5 billion for the quarter, up 6% reported and organic constant currency. We are pleased with this revenue growth, which despite some higher than expected unfavorability in FX was in line with our expectations.Our efforts to enhance our operating efficiency along with your focus retention on transformation help us deliver 60 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion for this quarter. This margin expansion was in line with our expectations and we are happy to see the progress that our associates continue to make in helping to improve our productivity, while also improving client satisfaction, particularly given the difficult margin compare given our strong performance in the first half of fiscal 2019.Together with share buybacks and a slightly lower than expected adjusted effective tax rate these results help us deliver 12% adjusted EPS growth this quarter, which was slightly ahead of our expectations.Moving on to Employer Services new business bookings, this quarter we saw solid growth across our US markets, which helped drive 6% growth in the quarter. With regard to our international and multinational sales opportunities, we did see some impact from timing as certain deals that were expected to close this quarter are now expected to close slightly later in the fiscal year. Nevertheless, we are maintaining our full year Employer Services new business bookings guidance of 6% to 8%.Now turning to Client Service. We continue to drive improvements in our client satisfaction scores across our businesses. And this quarter, we were especially pleased with our progress in the upmarket with improvements in both our implementation and overall client satisfaction scores.We continue to take positive steps to transform our service organization and enhance the client experience, and with this continued progress in mind, we remain confident in our forecasted full year fiscal 2020 retention increase of 10 basis points to 20 basis points.We are pleased with our start to fiscal 2020 and with the continued momentum in advancing our strategy to simplify how we do business, deliver innovative solutions for our clients and associates and drive sustainable long-term growth for our shareholders.We understand that a key element of building our success in the market is in the capacity to be agile and to anticipate and adopt to change. Innovation is at the core of this need and it\u2019s a job that's never done. While we are incredibly excited about the solutions, we are delivering in the market today to help clients meet the needs of an evolving workforce, we're even more excited about the future. As the workforce continues to evolve, organizations are looking for ways to manage their entire workforce through a single user experience.Today companies of all sizes are using a variety of applications to get work done. What they need is an open HCM platform that allows easy integration with third-party solutions and is also flexible enough to handle the increasingly dynamic nature of work, one where workers are organized around how work happens in teams, often with individuals working on multiple teams at the same time. Aided by insights from the ADP Research Institute, our Next Gen HCM platform is designed at the core to address these needs.A few weeks ago I had the opportunity to attend the HR Technology conference in Las Vegas where our Next Gen HCM platform and used innovations took center stage. As I met with clients and HR professionals, I was incredibly proud of the reception and recognition that we received for delivering innovative solutions that address how and where work is done today.I was especially proud when our Next Gen HCM platform won both the HR Executive Top HR Product of the year award and the Awesome New Technology award, a remarkable achievement and a testament to ADP's commitment to innovation.Back in September, we also had the opportunity to showcase some of the differentiating features of ADP's Next Gen platform to HCM industry analysts when we hosted our 2019 Industry Analyst Day. At this event, we spent time sharing some of the more meaningful and differentiating elements of our technology, such as, the use of graph database technology that powers the unique ability to dynamically configure teams while enabling actionable data and insights around relationships or our meta data driven design approach that allows solutions to be tailored by the client via local rapid development through a drag-and-drop interface.In addition, our solution was designed from the beginning to be public cloud native. This among other advantages helps improve resiliency and uptime.Finally, our solution is designed to be global. Companies that are expanding globally, or that would like to more effectively manage their existing global workforce are an ideal target for ADP Next Gen HCM.We were equally proud and excited to see, the recognition our efforts from industry experts, at this event. And while it is great to receive these awards and to recognized by industry experts.It is even more rewarding when we see our efforts translate into recognition and acknowledgment from our clients and prospects. As we work to scale our solution and its capabilities, our Next Gen platform is also building momentum in the market and continues to progress in line with our expectations.As an example, earlier this quarter, at our Industry Analyst Day, we shared details of a successful go live with a 6,000 employee U.S. company that chose ADP's Next Gen HCM platform for its talent capabilities. And the ease of the ease of integration with the client's own internally developed on-boarding tool.At the same events, we were also pleased to share that we have recently signed a 65,000-employee global enterprise that was looking for an HCM platform, capable of handling its growing workforce.With that said, our focus on innovation is not limited to our Next Gen HCM platform. We have also increasing the leverage, machine learning to enhance our core strategic advantages in payroll and big data. As an example, we simplified 21 million raw job titles from our unmatched data like, and normalized them down to 2,400 job categories, ultimately enhancing both this functionality and accuracy of our ADP data cloud benchmarking.Customers are using our compensation and HR benchmark data to make substantial changes to their business. For example, one of our clients was able to leverage our turn over benchmark data, to identify opportunities for improvement, and ultimately to reduce their turnover by 20%.While another saw its front line managers use our Executive and Manager Insight\u2019s mobile solution, to help reduce overtime cost by 6%. These equate to real multimillion dollar operational savings that are being enabled by ADP's data and products.Also to enhance the efficiency of our implementation organization, we are designing our NEXT GEN payroll engine to automatically recognize, convert and classify different formats, an input, from prior payrolls and so payroll policies.We believe that this will give us an advantage when we on board new clients, because it will enable the automation of various elements of the implementation process. And allow us to share best practices with our clients.And finally, we also continue to drive innovation for our frontline associates, in an effort to transform how we work, by reducing low value, client contacts, while still delivering value-added service.With this in mind, last year, our support organization and the downmarket rolled out expanded checkbox functionality, which today is capable of handling over 100 different inquiry types for our more than 640,000 small business clients.ADP's unique ability to meet the needs of clients and their workers today while anticipating their needs in the future, have been hallmarks of our success over the past 70 years. And I believe will driver sustained growth in the years to come.And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kathleen, for commentary on our results and fiscal 2020 outlook. I'll let maybe Kathleen make a comment as well. But again, I think if you that last year's pattern, our second quarter last year was soft. So that would be the easier compare. And the fourth quarter because of the acquisition of the client base acquisition from Wells Fargo, I think, it'll be a little more difficult.But we obviously try to apply some judgment on these things. And we obviously have information about individual unit performance and kind of what's happening across regions.And I think what we try to provide in some of the color our comments is that this quarter we had very strong, what I would call strong results in our core US businesses, SBS, major accounts and national accounts. And we really had some weakness with international and multinational. And we\u2019ll look into the details of that. There were a few large deals in prior year, as well as some deals that didn't close in the first quarter as expected. So that would give us some confidence that I think, we\u2019re still on track for the year, despite these kind of quarterly fluctuations.Because I think as Kathleen's said, and we said many times for us bookings is certainly more volatile than revenues. Obviously, we have the recurring revenue model. But on bookings the clock goes back to zero at the beginning of every quarter.But we see some underlying strength that gives us some optimism. But we did have some weakness in the international multinational and that is something that we\u2019re looking at. I don't think that it's any major change in the economy, because it\u2019s been kind of a difficult in the economic climate for a while in Europe where we have a large business. So, again as I look at the detail, it just looks like, typical lumpiness in our bookings. Don't forget we also again one of the highlights for the quarter and frankly it's been a highlight in trying to kind of signal this. I am not sure how it has landed yet, but our decision to use Workforce Now with the lower end of the upmarket, so call it that 1,000 to 3,000 even though frankly it can go higher. We have a couple of clients that have 8, 9,000 employees that are on Workforce Now. But that decision has been great competitively in growth wise. So we are selling a lot of units in that kind of lower end of the upmarket.So the ability to use Workforce Now for - and it fits certain types of profiles clients and you can probably imagine generally speaking they are large, but simpler and Vantage clients would be more complex and have more complex needs like complex benefits and talent requirements and so forth.And Lifion it\u2019s still obviously an early adopter type of product, even though we're getting great traction and we told you what - how we've done in terms of new sales given the size of ADP, it\u2019s really Workforce Now and Vantage Now that are affecting the numbers in terms of the bookings and the revenue. And I think again in case I wasn't clear like that we had a good quarter even in national accounts in the upmarket primarily as a result of really good results from Workforce Now.So the strategy is the same strategy we\u2019ve had all along, which is I think we\u2019ve figured out that we have a really great solution for a segment of the market. I think last quarter, I mentioned that we have an external third-party do some analysis for us and in terms of segmenting the market, and as usual one solution doesn't fit the entire market. And what we found was that a pretty good size percentage of the market can be addressed by our Workforce Now solutions and that's what we're doing.And we were right. And the analysis was right. And we think the Vantage still addresses another segment of the market and Lifion is more kind of the emerging solution that we obviously have placed a lot of confidence and a lot of a - and a big bet on for the future. But as of today it's really not having a big impact on the numbers.And I also just in terms of just your question about market dynamic when we had this meeting in Las Vegas at the HR Tech Conference that I mentioned in my comments again, early positive signs we had for anyone who was there, I think some of our \u2013 some industry analysts and some financial analysts were there, I think, it was pretty clear that we are making an impact in the market. So our lead flow was multiples of what it has been in the past in the upmarket because of the interest in Lifion.But I just want to be cautious in terms of pace here because relative to our $15 billion in revenue, this is not next quarter or three quarters from now. But the signs are very, very positive in the long-term as Kathleen mentioned. If you focus on the long-term, I think, Lifion - the traction we're getting in Lifion is very, very encouraging. You know, I think, it goes back to what we're saying about the some of the underlying performance of the business. So as an example, even though we don't give quarterly guidance on retention, you could tell from our comments, I hope that we felt pretty good about it this quarter, so that you could probably read into that it improved prior to - compared to last year's prior first quarter.And as I mentioned before retention if you do the math has a pretty outside impact on our business bookings in terms of revenue and frankly big impact on margin because for equal growth you don't have to implement as much business.And so there's a lot of different moving parts that go into the pot here, but I would point that one out as an area of strength. I think we've talked about the strong performance in our core U.S. businesses.So for the first quarter we had kind of our three core businesses performing very well in terms of bookings as well. So it's a process from the ground up of us building this forecast, first of plan and now the forecast and I think we have some optimism that we're still in that range.And but I just want to point out the retention story because three or four years ago when it was going the other way, I pointed out that it takes four to five points of sales growth of new business bookings growth to offset one point of retention just because of the way the math works. And so - now as retention - as you get a little bit of improvement in retention that helps a lot in terms of our growth rate. And I would just add on the client funds interest, we do have some of this - for the year it obviously has an impact as we guided - we gave you the information in terms of we are slightly below what we expected to be, but it's not a huge number for this fiscal year. Yes. I do have some sense. My sense is that, we're improving a lot. So we show some signs in terms of the win-loss, what we call balance of the trade, some encouraging signs particularly in our mid-market business.So again the mid-market now is performing - you got to be cautious because there's definitely a forward-looking statement. But it's performing according to the script, in the sense if you remember we took a lot of pain and lot of effort to migrate all of our clients on to one single strategic platform which is Workforce Now.And when you look at the history of what happened in our SBS downmarket business. When we did that, we were optimistic and hopeful that we would have the same kind of traction in our mid-market business. And it's beginning to show now.So we have improving retention now for it feels like six or seven quarters somewhere in that range. I am being told more. So once we kind of finish the migration and got through that difficulty. I think we have steady improvements in retention.This quarter was the second highest retention we've ever had, in our mid-market business. And in this quarter what was very encouraging is to see the level of activity in new business bookings. So, the combination of those two things gives us a feeling of optimism for what is - one of biggest and more profitable businesses. Well if I can start with the second one first, since I was there in the analysts and not fair to ask Kathleen. I think we have built the guidance for or I guess the estimates for are three years. We had as I think we've mentioned this couple of times, we had certain expectations around our pass through revenue and inflation of those numbers that had some historical precedent, both around workers compensation and health care.And I think literally within two months of that, the picture changed, and we communicated that very clearly and very transparently and frankly, without any anxiety because it doesn't have any impact in our EPS. So if you remember the Investor Day, I think it June and I think when we had our August earnings call, I think, we brought down significantly for that year at least, the growth rate for the PEO mainly - primarily close to almost based on lower inflation.Now on top of that, we have had some slowdown in worksite employee growth, which is the core driver underneath of the real growth of the business. But I think a main driver of this differential from what we communicated at our Investor Day has been has been the lower inflation of the pass-through, which again doesn't concern us, in a big way because it\u2019s zero margin and doesn't really affect our profitability in terms of in terms of dollars.In terms of your question about the behavior of the quarters and so forth, probably beyond the scope of this call but, it's just kind of math in terms of when we have our open enrollment for healthcare in kind of May, June timeframe which we\u2019ve again communicated very transparently when that happens and what happens when that occurs, you tend to have some client churn.So that drops your worksite employee growth and obviously revenue growth for the PEO. And then as bookings continue to - assuming they continue to be robust, you start to build that up again. And then at the end of the calendar year-end, you have another event at year end where you have some churn in the client base in terms of clients that choose to leave at the end of the calendar year because that's more natural, but we also have historically a lot of bookings in January as well.So we've been doing this for 20 years and we see a difference or a change we would obviously communicate that. But I think we're just kind of dropping the numbers in as they are supposed to come in terms of -- based on historical trends.And David I would just add, so last quarter we did say that we would expect to start a year from the lower end of the range and then grow into the range as the year progresses because obviously, we started with a somewhat of a weaker ending worksite employee number in the fourth quarter last year. It's a great question because it's an important one for us to keep kind of asking ourselves, we do have some things that you know if they turn on us would put pressure on us, interest rates obviously is one of them, pays per control, et cetera.But we're also feeling pretty good about our product situation and I think our competitive situation in the marketplace going forward here. So it is -- that's going to be a very important question for us to stay focused on here for the next few quartersBut as of today, when you look at our lagging indicators so pays per control, it doesn't look like there's a slow down or a big issue, but if you look at the same things that everyone else would look at that we have access to and you have access to in terms of leading indicators like confidence indexes or NFIB/ISM - those types of things Michigan confidence.You know those, there\u2019s some concern there and some reason for caution. In our numbers, the only place where we have seen some little bit of softness and pace for control and it doesn't get reflected in our and what we report because as we've disclosed prior this is our Autopay base which is a very large base of both large employers, midsize employers and smaller employers.But we have most of our employer in our run platform and there we've seen a slight down tick in pays per control growth over the prior year. It doesn't - when you look at over the 10-year history, I don't think it's anything to be alarmed by, but - when you look at other factors it certainly a cause for caution. I just happened to look I think, in the last couple of days at NFIB and that's softened significantly, but it's still well above recession levels.And so I think we\u2019re all kind of trying to figure out the same thing here which is a soft patch or is it kind of a trend line. But with - the Fed easing and the consumer still strong like right now our plans are that we kind of work our way through this soft patch. Hi, Brian. I just - one thing just to add, as you think about the margin because your question I think was related to margins in particular. And obviously what's driving those. But last year, the first and second quarter but particularly the second quarter was a very strong growth in margin in that time.And just a reminder, we also had pressure from M&A at that time. So, just layer that one on to it as well when you think about margin cadence last year versus this year. No. You will see individual employee, claims data but we of course very, very carefully looking at claims data to get some sense with our carriers and partnership with our carriers, what's happening in terms of trends.Maybe I should be a little bit more, clear on this, premium increase issue. So, I'm not going to give you the exact numbers. I don't think we want to get down that rabbit hole. But the change from this renewal to the prior renewal was call it one to two percentage points higher, on average than the prior year. So if, the previous year the average renewal increase was 6% then the next year it was it was it was 7% or 8%.And that increase that year that was slightly higher was completely in line with the prior six or seven years. So it wasn't -- so there are some ups and downs. But the prior year was one that was actually exceptional. I think we were very clear about that. I think we talked about that in our calls, that we had a really great renewal on our health care on average I remember this is not one carrier. These are multiple carriers.We use a number of different carriers to make sure we have good coverage across the entire country. And so, that was unusual. And it helped us competitively. But I think this renewal was not out of line with historical norms and has nothing to do with any of that.I think anything that's happening around health care this probably has to do with people's underwriting policies and their own approach to bringing in business and repricing business, because it's not just about the business you bring in.But every year if you're self-insured or you're taking risk, you have the opportunity or the option of passing through or not passing through health care costs. And you actually have some judgment with your underwriters on what those costs are.And so that's generally typically what could create a problem in health care. But it doesn't appear to us that there's really anything happening broadly in the health care industry around PEOs. I think that's right. That's fair. And I think on the workers comp, just again to be clear was a -- I think we were clear, but why don\u2019t we say one more time, a smaller positive. So we're not having big surprises in terms of losses in workers comp or any kind of. And by the way we have very tight ship there in a sense that we have as we disclose in our 10-K, a collar that limits our risk in a fairly significant way. Caps are down side on workers comp. So we have reinsurance an individual claim and then we have a collar around overall loss estimates. So it's quite limited in terms of the volatility.I think the other thing that I would mention is that our business mix hasn't changed, so we look at that very carefully as well. So we looked at the mix of we call it white collar versus gray collar, but within those categories you have a lot of different industries and a lot of different categories of people and we don't see any major change there as well. I think it's - it goes back to like my first year marketing class in graduate school, which is high involvement decision, right. So the PEO to go to a small midsize business and tell them that you're going to create a co-employment relationship, you're taking over there healthcare plan, there\u2019s workers' compensation remember all along the way there are as an example that could be a relationship with insurance agent or a broker that's been providing to health care in the workers comp for the last 10 years that gets this intermediated.You have to - payroll is hard enough to convince some of the payroll because people worry about \u2013 are you sure you are not going to make a mistake and make sure that it's going to go accurately, we obviously have an incredibly strong reputation on payroll that helps us.But the traditional business is you\u2019re trying to convince someone to give you your payroll, now you're also trying to convince them to give you everything around their HR department.And so it's with a higher level of trust and it's again what I remember being taught is called a high involvement decision, which takes longer to make and is more difficult to make.So I honestly don't think that there is really anything that prevents clients from becoming PEO clients. And I think we've demonstrated over 20 years that we've convinced a lot of them.And so our board asks the same question you're asking, which can't you convince even more. And we're trying. Like, we continue to add improvements in the product. We continue to provide better tools. We continue to enhance our product. We continue to do all the things we can to make it more compelling and easier to use.As an example, I think we've kind of talked about this in the last 18 months, all new business now and the PEO starting in our Workforce Now platform which has higher functionality and provides the ability to satisfy slightly larger clients than we could before because it's a mid-market platform.And so there is a lot of things that we're doing to try to convince as many clients to come over to our PEO solution as possible. I think it's good for them and it's good for them and it's good for us but there's really nothing that I can point to other than kind of the difficulties of the convincing of the sale. Selling more new clients than losing clients. It really goes back to the - I mean, I hate to I'm not trying to be a smart [indiscernible] but the it's really the pattern, I think, I talked about it a couple of questions ago that when we tell our open enrollment in May and June, we tend to experience some client turn. The sales don't accelerate necessarily at the same necessarily at the same time.And so you have seen that phenomenon happens sometimes at the end of the calendar year where you may lose a group of clients and then you bring on new clients at the beginning of the year, but then you also bring on - so clients tend to not leave at other times of year other than calendar year end and open enrollment which is May and June.That doesn't mean non leave, I'm just saying that the skewing is cued towards those two periods. And the sales are skewed differently. And the combination of those two things is what causes either growth or deceleration in worksite employee growth. But again in this case we also have - we have to hit our plan, obviously. I guess as usual when we have these calls, if we are giving you the numbers based on what we expect right now. So if we hit our new business bookings plans and retentions stays when we expected to stay then you would get the outcomes that we're talking about.But as Kathleen said, there's a lot of moving parts if three to six months from now, the economies in the tank and pays per control is declining, it's going to in the PEO in addition to ES and it less than ADP and that would create a headwind. But in the absence of any new information I think, we feel pretty good about the forecast we have. Well, I think again back to like what Kathleen was talking about in terms of the math, some of it was really comparisons rather than anything that we're doing. And but we have to help people. We understand that it's important for you guys to understand that.So, just as a reminder last year what happened was, we had with the voluntary early retirement program, we had a good number of people taking that. And then the back fills that we had planned which was all planned, certain percentage of back fills were delayed.And so that impacted that year. We also got off to a very strong start for a couple of other reasons. We had other what we called quick wins at a time around transformation that help us get off to a strong start in the first half.And I think Kathleen talked about -- we had for us, like incredibly strong margin improvement. And so it's just a very difficult compare mathematically. As we've been going along, regardless of how the math works, we continue to work on a number of initiatives.And this year obviously we executed on this expand the layers initiative, and then we have a number of other projects around procurement is one of them but we also have a number kind of automation and digitization project that I think we're making some progress on. And when we have our industry - sorry our Analyst Day in February, we'll probably share a little bit more around some of those things that we're doing, because those are around transformation and innovation as well. So it's not just about innovating on the product side. But it's also innovating on the implementation and on the service side.And we\u2019ve gotten some good traction in some of our businesses which are allows our productivity to improve while, still for our associates. While still improving our NPS scores and our client satisfaction which by the way were up again this quarter and no surprise the retention is improving.It\u2019s usually a sign that client satisfaction is still high. So again trick here is you want to transform your cost structure, but you don't want to like lose all the clients in the meantime. And for now, we've been able to balance both of those and that's our plan here for the next year or two. Again, one little statistic, because we happen to notice these things when we prepare for these calls. Because now I get like seems like 20 years of information, so we\u2019ve reduced our share count by 30% since the early 2000\u2019s, and so we intend to continue to stay on that pace.And so obviously it's a marathon for a company like we're kind of proud that it's a marathon we've been around for seven years. And at 1% per year it adds up. And it certainly has added up in the last 20 years to the tune of a 30% share reduction.And I think that companies are in the different stage of development whether they're getting dilution and adding shares to their share count. We think we're going to win this marathon. Yeah. No, I think that's a fair characterization. I think that as usual there\u2019s \u2013 and we try to obviously be as straight as we can be because sometimes there is a slight disconnect between what we\u2019re expecting versus since we don\u2019t give quarterly guidance. But the results I think were on that specific topic, I think we're in line with our expectations. That's a good question. I think that when you look at the annual guidance, I think it was down flat to 25 down\u2026 Down to 25 basis points. I think that was the guidance. If you take our first quarter number, I would for now assume ratably margin improvement over the course of the rest of the year because these quarterly fluctuations in ADP Indemnity are not something that is - something that we can have a - we don't have any real visibility into that.And again, just as a reminder, part of why we've done this is, if you remember a couple of years ago, we had some criticism around our disclosures. So we had our client funds interest and Indemnity being handled in the kind of other category, which allowed us to not have these questions and not kind of makes up the results of those businesses.But as usual, there are two sides to every story. And so I think the criticism was those things really belong and the results of the business unit. Fair enough. So we made that change and now we are saddled with every quarter having to explain any kind of fluctuations here, because what really matters is the underlying health of the business.We don\u2019t take enough risk in that business for it to matter. But you can get because of the size of the business, if you get a $5 million fluctuation which is what we had this quarter up or down, it affects the numbers, but it doesn't really say anything about what's happening in the underlying business.But it is what it is. We now report Indemnity in the PEO and we\u2019re going to have to every quarter be able to give you that kind of color. And likewise in Employer Services we now have client funds interest. And so now that creates some variability in that business as well. It was certainly easier when we didn't have ADP Indemnity in the PEO. But because nothing -- we've been doing that for 20 years. We've handled it. We\u2019re not by the way we are handling exactly the same way we\u2019ve always handled it. It\u2019s just a different accounting report. That's all. Well, thanks very much. You can tell we feel pretty good about the start to 2020. We're obviously trying to change a lot of things. We\u2019ve talked a lot about transformation. We'll share more with you when we have our Innovation Day here in February.But we\u2019re focused on execution as I think Kathleen alluded to this there's still a lot of execution in front of us. But we still - we try continue to be focused on our clients and our associates. And our associates are doing a phenomenal job as evidenced by our continuing improvements in our NPS scores.Obviously, we felt good about what happened with HR Tech, with our Lifion debut. So I think that gives us some optimism. We're very excited about what's happening in the mid-market business here in the first quarter.So I - continue to be very proud of our organization and the resiliency of the organization and the transformation efforts that they continue to execute on. So we look forward to giving you more updates in the time to come. And we thank you for joining our call today. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanyal Hussain: Thank you, Sarah. And welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the fourth quarter and full year. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today\u2019s call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I\u2019d also like to share that we intend to host our Investor Day on November 15th. At this time, we\u2019re planning to keep it virtual for most of our attendees. But given positive reopening trends, we do have capacity here in our Roseland, New Jersey headquarters to host our sell side analysts live and we look forward to seeing our analyst community in person soon. With that, let me turn it over to Carlos.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you, Danny, and thank you everyone for joining our call. We reported very strong fourth quarter results, including 11% revenue growth and 5% adjusted diluted EPS growth, capping a year end which revenue and margin outperformed our expectations in every quarter. For the full year, we delivered 3% revenue growth, the high end of our guidance range, and I\u2019m happy to say, we reached $15 billion in revenue, a big milestone for the company. As we\u2019ve discussed all year, we took a consistent approach to investing this year, while also prudently managing expenses. As a result, our adjusted EBIT margin was down only slightly and we were able to deliver 2% adjusted diluted EPS growth for the year, ahead of our guidance and well ahead of our expectations at the start of the year. I\u2019ll first cover some highlights from the quarter. Our new business bookings results were very strong and our momentum in the market continues to build. Compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter, we grew our Employer Services New Business Bookings by 174%, which was slightly ahead of our expectations. And for the full year, we delivered 23% growth in ES bookings, towards the higher end of our guidance. We are very pleased with this outcome from our sales team, which booked $1.5 billion in new business in a year with a high degree of economic uncertainty.\nKathleen Winters: Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter represented a strong close to the year, with 11% revenue growth on a reported basis and 9% growth on an organic constant currency basis, solidly ahead of our expectations. Our adjusted EBIT margin was down 120 basis points better than expected. And as a reminder, we did have some compare -- comparison pressure versus last year\u2019s lower selling and incentive compensation expenses that drove the comparative decline. Our 5% adjusted diluted EPS growth was strong, and in addition to the revenue and margin performance benefited from share repurchases. For our Employer Services segment, revenues increased 10% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic constant currency basis, as we lapped last year\u2019s pandemic affected Q4. We continued to see contributions from excellent retention, strong new business booking and growth in pays per control offset by lower client funds interest. ES margin was down 90 basis points due primarily to higher selling and incentive compensation expenses versus the prior year. Our PEO also had another very strong quarter. Average worksite employees increased to 616,000, up 12% on a year-over-year basis on both continued retention outperformance and contribution from solid employment growth. Our PEO revenue grew 12%, an impressive performance as we once again benefited from higher payroll for WSE, as well as stronger workers comp and SUI revenue for WSE compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower growth and zero margin pass-throughs. PEO margin was up 340 basis points in the quarter, due to an elevated worker\u2019s compensation reserve true-up last year. We were very pleased with our strong finish to the year. For fiscal 2021, a year heavily impacted by a pandemic, we drove strong bookings growth, solid 3% revenue growth, delivered positive EPS growth and continue to invest for sustainable growth and digital transformation.\nOperator: Thank you.  We will take our first question on the line of Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.\nEugene Simuni: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Maybe to start with a little bit of a high level macro question, so Katelyn, you just highlighted that there is significant amount of secular growth that\u2019s coming out in HR services industry from the pandemic? Can you speak a little bit more about where you guys are seeing the indications that the secular growth is actually helping, financial performance of ADP and how much of that is incorporated in your fiscal year 2022 guidance and where can we see that effect in the numbers?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think there are probably a couple of highlights. I think, Kathleen, probably has a couple of other, she would -- she can mention. But, like, I think, we mentioned in our prepared remarks, what we\u2019re seeing around Workforce Management in terms of time tracking and scheduling and so forth. We also mentioned some of the products we\u2019ve developed for Return to Workplace. So there are a number of things that are probably related to what\u2019s likely to be a more hybrid work environment for white collar employees at least on a go-forward basis, which probably requires people to think about their investments in HCM in terms of what they can do to maximize, the recruiting and the retention and the engagement of that hybrid workforce. So I think that is one. The other one is, there\u2019s always been a secular uptrend in terms of regulatory related and this is on a global basis, demand for HCM products. In other words, the more complexity there is around being an employer, the greater the demand for the wide array of services that we provide. That secular trend has probably gotten a bit of a boost based on in the U.S. the change in administrations, right, which we\u2019ve had that secular growth for seven years that ADP has existed. But there are times where it\u2019s stronger in terms of a tailwind and sometimes where it\u2019s weaker. And I would say that we\u2019re heading into strong secular tailwind here, as a result of some of the increased attention on regulatory actions. And you probably all saw, I think, it was yesterday, the day before, that the President signed number of executive orders, most of which are aimed at employer employee related relationships that increase the amount of tracking and reporting and compliance necessary on the part of employer. So those are a couple that I would mention. I think our retention rate also shows in -- an indirect way secular demand improving right in the sense that people have kind of rethought dropping or switching from their HCM vendors. But that one is a little difficult to be 100% sure about, because we do expect some normalization in that retention rate.\nKathleen Winters: Yeah. I think that really covers a lot of that. I mean to kind of summarize and categorize what Carlos said, when you think about the complexity, number one, of being employer, the ongoing and pretty significant changes that we see from a regulatory standpoint. So complexity, regulatory change, the dynamic environment as the way people work and employer relationship -- employer employee relationship changes, it\u2019s a very dynamic environment. All of that is, you can just see in, the bookings number that we have. Our bookings, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get into the discussion on this, but the growth is pretty broad base. I mean, certainly, we saw some channels stronger than others, but it\u2019s pretty broad base. And I think that\u2019s because of all of this dynamic change and complexity that we see, and in particular, our comprehensive solutions that our outsourcing solutions have seen quite significant growth. So we\u2019re really encouraged about the macro trends that we see in the space.\nCarlos Rodriguez: And again, I think that, it\u2019s all -- I\u2019ve always never known what is defined the secular versus not secular. But the huge demand now for talent, what\u2019s happening in the labor markets. Obviously, that\u2019s a huge tailwind for all of us in the HCM space in terms of recruiting tools and engagement tools to try to hold on to people. But that could also be something that wanes in six months. That\u2019s -- that one\u2019s a little harder to tell. But generally speaking the war for talent has always been also a secular tailwind to our industry as well.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Got it. Thank you. Great. And then for a follow up related and talking about the bookings growth and looking at your guidance for 10% to 16% growth next year. Can just quickly speak to kind of two or three key swing factors that you see that will define whether we\u2019re going to end up on the lower end or higher end of that range, as we kind of turn the corner on the recovery and go through the spirit?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Sure. So the -- actually I can probably give you a three that would probably account for kind of the way we think about this. So number one, obviously, is what we just talked about is the secular and cyclical tailwinds or headwinds. So if the economy continues with the momentum it\u2019s got, we\u2019re feeling pretty good. Obviously, if we end up having more challenges, because of the pandemic or otherwise, but right now the amount of -- even the existing government stimulus, even if there\u2019s no additional stimulus is pretty strong and also the pent-up demand and all these -- the reopening. That feels like a very good backdrop for us from a bookings growth standpoint. And then, as long as we have that background or that backdrop that\u2019s positive, it really comes down to really two things is sales force productivity at the Sales Quota Carrier level time, number of Sales Quota Carriers and I hate to be so simplistic, but at our size, because we have new products and we\u2019re rolling out, you heard how excited we are about all the new things that we\u2019re putting out there. But we sell a lot of business every year. So for a smaller company, when they end up having like a new product launch that can cause all kinds of growths, and by the way, likewise, if you don\u2019t have any new products. But for us, what I would consider to be a steady-eddy. So we really grow through methodically improving and adding new products, making talking acquisitions, et cetera, a lot of us. But the key formula for us is we cannot hit our sales plan unless we have the headcount and we are continually improving our sales force productivity and that\u2019s exactly what our plan is. And we have some good news over the last four quarters where our sales force productivity at the Average Quota Carrier level steadily improved throughout the year to reach 90% for the full year. But we exited the fourth quarter in kind of the mid-90%s, if you will, in comparison to pre-pandemic levels. So it feels like we\u2019re getting back to the quote-unquote trend from an average sales productivity standpoint and if we can get back to that trend, and we deliver on our hill -- on our headcount additions, we should be able to hit our new business bookings number.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Pete Christiansen with Citi. Your line is now open.\nPete Christiansen: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Carlos, you talked about a lot of new logo wins this year, which is pretty impressive. But I was curious to hear how you think about how this may have changed your or ADP\u2019s cross-sell, upsell opportunity set? I\u2019d imagine the runway there is expanded quite a bit, and perhaps, how you are thinking about strategy, that land and expand strategy to really take advantage of this opportunity? Thank you.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yeah. So one of the -- in case somebody asked that we, one of the questions we sometimes get is and it\u2019s related to what you\u2019re asking is the mix of how much is new logo sales versus how much is add-on sales. And it\u2019s really been very steady over many years. It was only during the ACA period where we had a little bit of a tilt more towards incremental add-on sales. But it\u2019s -- for a long time been around 50-50 and it\u2019s still kind of in that neighborhood. So that I think bodes well because the more clients we add, the more opportunities we have pursue that land and expand, I think, approach that you just described. So I would say that, we\u2019re bullish on the opportunity to continue to go back to the new logos that we sold, which in many cases, we sell with multiple modules, but there\u2019s always additional room for new products as well to go back to that existing client base. So I think that underlying logo growth, I think, is another kind of supportive factor, if you will, for a new business bookings, because we do get about 50% of our bookings from our existing client base.\nPete Christiansen: That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow up, I was just hoping if you could juxtapose the GlobalView business versus the rest of ES. I know, they haven\u2019t been totally in sync during this recovery. What are you seeing there of late trend wise? And as you look towards the outlook, is that part of the business considered or laggard behind the remainder of the ES or is there some variability there that investors should be aware of? Thank you.\nCarlos Rodriguez: It\u2019s actually a little bit of the opposite. Maybe we may have confused some people, I think, in prior calls. But I think, GlobalView is probably, could be at the top of our list in terms of performance this year, like, large multinational companies have been, I think, looking for ways. I think this pandemic rate -- raise probably some issues and concerns around control. I think for the HR leaders that probably raised some issues around engagement and making sure that you\u2019re connected to your global workforce and that you had global reporting, et cetera. So there\u2019s a lot of factors that probably went into what was incredibly strong demand and very positive sales growth. So I would say that, again, we don\u2019t disclose individual product lines, but I would say, the GlobalView sales were one of the stronger line items, I think, for us. And I\u2019ll add that to your question about differences between the businesses. I think all of our businesses really performed well. It\u2019s kind of hard, it really come down to trying to point out which ones were spectacular versus just good. And I would say that GlobalView and even our International business really were standouts and I -- really it\u2019s very impressive, because some of the situations in Europe, for example, were very challenging in terms of dealing with the pandemic, but I didn\u2019t really stop people from looking for solutions and it didn\u2019t stop our sales force from finding them, even though they had to do that from obviously from a remote workplace. So, I guess, summary is, GlobalView is a shining star for us.\nKathleen Winters: Yeah. They saw good momentum as we closed out the year. In fact, it was a particularly strong closed with a good number of multinational deals on GlobalView coming through at the end of the year and we\u2019re looking at fiscal 2022 for them to be a big contributor again.\nCarlos Rodriguez: And again just -- the only -- again, it doesn\u2019t make a huge difference in the overall ADP revenue numbers. But these strong bookings remember will really translate into revenue and cause six months to 18 months, because these are large, typically large multinationals that take some time to implement. But that should be a positive thing for us kind of looking forward, if you will, in that six-month to 18-month horizon.\nPete Christiansen: Thank you. Great color and really nice execution. Good job. Thank you.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much and good morning. I wanted to ask quickly and I think it\u2019s tied into some of the comments you\u2019ve made around your guidance. But specifically, how are you thinking about like the well-publicized difficulties employers are having attracting employees and that kind of thing? How is that factoring into your guidance and your formulation and are expecting resolution of that as we go through the fiscal year. Just trying to get a little bit of color how you\u2019re putting the macro environment into forecasts?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, I mean, I would probably put that in the bucket of secular tailwinds or cyclical tailwinds, depending on your view of whether it\u2019s short-term or long-term. But it does seem like if this kind of resolves itself, let\u2019s -- there\u2019s a couple scenarios, but if it\u2019s transitory in terms of the friction of getting people into the right job and then six months from now some of this has passed, by the time we get to that point, unemployment might be down into kind of the 4% to 5% range, which then creates a whole another wave of needs for employers in terms of finding talent and kind of fighting for talents over. So it feels to us like this is a multiyear cycle here where employers are going to be really scrambling to find people. I think that generally creates conversation opportunities. So we don\u2019t have a magic formula necessary, and necessarily, we\u2019re not a staffing firm. But we do have tools and we have technology, and we have people that can help our clients be more competitive as they look for solutions, as they look for the right employees in the right place at the right time at the right pay level. That\u2019s our sweet spot. And so I\u2019d say we\u2019re right in the middle of this, what I would call, super cycle of demand for labor that is probably short-term related to kind of friction where people are just not in the right places and people are probably also some -- there\u2019s some hesitation, still there\u2019s issues with childcare and eldercare, there\u2019s a number of factors. It is -- we assume like other economists that this will be -- that part will be transitory, but that the need for people will not be, given just the obvious low unemployment rate, which we will be at by the end of, call it, calendar year 2022.\nJames Faucette: That\u2019s really helpful, Carlos. And then just as it relates to sales productivity, you highlighted that on your -- you\u2019re expecting and seeing improvement there. At the same time -- and you indicated that there, you\u2019re being able to get your salespeople in front of more accounts and potential accounts. How closely tied do you expect those two things to be as we go through the rest of the fiscal year?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Again, this -- we\u2019re uncharted territory. It\u2019s a little hard to give a scientific answer, because this last year, we were not able to get in front of a lot of our process, actually most of our process until recently. And yeah, we delivered, I would say, very solid and strong bookings results. So I think some of this is really about us being able to adapt, which is our job to what the market wants, right, what the clients want and what the prospects want. And the fact of the matter is that about half of our -- half of the workforce out there, which probably translates into half of our clients, they actually kept going to workplaces, they kept making things, delivering things and going to workplaces. The rest of the some of us white collar employees didn\u2019t. So that segment of the prospects and clients, they expect us to be available, if they want us to meet with them in person. We\u2019re not going to go force anyone to meet in person. We\u2019re happy to meet them if they want to be met, whether it\u2019s virtually, online or in person. But we want to be ready for whatever the market wants and for whatever the market demands and that\u2019s exactly our plan. But to answer your question, it\u2019s really hard to know which factor is the most important factor. We think that being able and willing and available to meet in person with prospects is an important element of our sales success for fiscal 2022. But I can\u2019t really put a number on it because we were successful in 2021 without doing that.\nKathleen Winters: Yeah. I think the key is that we\u2019re going to have to make sure we can continue to be nimble just as we were in fiscal 2021, right? If there are certain regions or points in time where we might have to scale back a little bit in the face-to-face, I think we\u2019re nimble enough to do that. We\u2019ve proven we could do that. But we\u2019re certainly ready and have been out there doing face-to-face and hope that that continues.\nJames Faucette: Thanks, Kathleen. Thanks, Carlos.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is now open.\nDan Dolev: Hey, guys. Great results. Thanks for taking my questions. So, can you discuss how the retention has varied by sort of the three ES by the three sub-segments, SMB, mid-market and up market? And what happens to the SMBs once the PPP rolls off, so how should we think about kind of your guidance for retention versus like those three vectors? And then I have a very short follow up? Thanks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: That\u2019s a good question. I think, Kathleen, may probably have a little bit of additional color. But I would tell you that, this -- I think your insinuation that the PPP loans may have something to do with these elevated retention rates is something that we\u2019ve heard kind of out there in the -- in terms of as a buzz. And again, that\u2019s very hard to, like, put our finger on in terms of how to quantify that and what\u2019s the impact? But for sure, one of the strongest areas we\u2019ve had in retention is our down market business and that is why I think we\u2019ve prudently planned for some give back on that next year. Having said that, I will tell you that, this year, fiscal 2021 and the two months before that were probably the greatest example of ADP\u2019s business model in terms of ability to deliver. Now we call it service, you can call it compliance and call it whatever you want, but when the chips were down and people needed help and needed to talk to someone about their PPP loan and they weren\u2019t calling their banker, they didn\u2019t have to apply for a loan and they didn\u2019t have to go through a bank, but you can go do your own channel checks to see how many banks were actually answering the phone or giving people advice, because they were completely overwhelmed as we were, but we actually figured out a way to handle it and we were there for our clients. And so, I think that, what we just did over the last year and I get it I\u2019m a pragmatist, so memories are short and we have to continue to impress and continue to deliver for our clients. But I think we just proved to hundreds of thousands of clients, and hopefully, the prospects from a reputation standpoint that if you want to have someone who\u2019s a partner, if ADP, if you want software, you can buy software. But if you want great technology and great software, but you want someone who\u2019s going to be able to deliver on the service side, then you should be with ADP. And so I think that that\u2019s going to have some -- there\u2019s going to be some factor and hopefully allowing us to hold on to some of this retention on a more permanent basis, because I think the -- when the chips were down, I think, people saw the difference between not having someone that you could get help from and having someone that you can reach out to and get advice and get your problems -- major problem solved. But the bottomline is, we clearly are prudent and aware that some of this normalization could result in some lower retention rates, particularly in the down market, as you are, I think, alluding to.\nKathleen Winters: Yeah. I mean, that\u2019s covered a lot of. In fiscal 2021, look, we saw strong retention across almost all of our channels, our businesses, particularly in small business and mid-market as well, though, and even actually on the international side where the retention is very high. We thought it\u2019s a little bit higher there as well, too. So, pretty much strong across the Board. But look, we want to be prudent from a planning perspective and while we haven\u2019t seen any change yet in terms of switching or along those lines. I do think it\u2019s prudent to plan that there\u2019s going to be, I\u2019ll call it, a little bit of give back in fiscal 2022. I think we are going to hold on to some of the games. We\u2019re certainly attempting to do that. We want to do that. But I do think it\u2019s prudent to plan for a little bit of give back, which we\u2019ve done and that would be primarily with regard to small business segment normalizing back to pre-pandemic levels.\nCarlos Rodriguez: But to be clear, there\u2019s no -- I\u2019m not aware of a particular -- there\u2019s nothing that ties a client to us or anyone else because of the PPP loans. What I\u2019ve heard the theory that some people have somehow some kind of psychological thing that it\u2019ll just make things more difficult if you switch and I -- I\u2019m obviously not a small business owner. So we talk to small business owners. We\u2019re just not hearing that. But it feels logical that could be a factor of that. But to be clear, there is no particular trigger that on November 15th we\u2019re going to lose 100,000 clients because their PPP loans have been repaid or expired. That\u2019s not the way the program work.\nDan Dolev: Understood. And then my quick follow up and I think it\u2019s somewhat ties to this is the margin guidance. What I\u2019m hearing this morning from investors is, it might be -- I don\u2019t know maybe slight, maybe light of expectations. I mean, is that somewhat tied to the mix shift next year or is there anything else that you could call out on the margin guidance? Thanks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, listen, after 10 years of doing this, I\u2019ve never heard anyone say that your margin guidance was too aggressive and too high. So let me just start off with that comment. And part of that is that we\u2019re always trying to balance short-term and long-term investors. I\u2019m not sure which one you were hearing from. But our intent here is to continue the machine, right, and the momentum that has led to multiple decades here of compounded growth and creation of value over a very long period of time and that requires delivering short-term results, as well as long-term results. And those long-term results, I think, require some investment including on the R&D side. But in particular this year, really the biggest factor is selling expense and sales investment, which has happened to us in the past, we\u2019ve had other times and call it 2000, 2001 or 2002 and then, 2008, 2009, 2010, because I was around for those, where as we reaccelerate and take advantage of demand back to the secular growth opportunity. The way our business model works is we incur a lot of upfront selling and implementation expense. Now there\u2019s some accounting rules that allow you to defer some of that. But generally speaking, you get elevated selling expenses and implementation expenses, and it\u2019s pretty significant. So I would say that that is a significant part of what would have maybe otherwise been higher margins for 2022. But when that business then is on the books, that\u2019s a high incremental margin business that then in 2023, 2024 and then for the next 12 years to 13 years, that\u2019s how long we keep our clients on average creates an annuity. So as you can imagine, we never turn down the incremental opportunity to add business, never, because it is just the way the value creation model works. And we\u2019re going to make hay while the sun is shining here. And with 6%, 7% GDP growth last quarter and what\u2019s likely to be incredibly strong GDP in the next year or two, we\u2019re going to take every possible opportunity. And unfortunately, that requires some selling expense and some implementation expense in addition to the ongoing investments in technology and some of the other things that we do.\nKathleen Winters: Yeah. So just big picture when you think about margin for next year and we\u2019re very happy that we\u2019re able to kind of guide to the 25 basis points to 50 basis points of margin expansion, I mean, look, we always look to do better than the plan, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re comfortable with. Right now, the way to think about it is, look, we\u2019re going to have operating leverage to a greater extent in fiscal 2022, obviously, but we\u2019ve also got the investments that we want to continue to make, as Carlos just articulated, in product, in sales and in digital transformation importantly. And we do have some offsets, Carlos mentioned, the sales expense. But we also have things like, Return to Office and ramping up T&E versus what we were -- where we were in fiscal 2021. So kind of all that goes into the mix, net-net, we\u2019ve got this 25 basis points to 50 basis points margin expansion. We\u2019re going to do our best to deliver on that and continue to work our digital transformation and if possible do even more.\nCarlos Rodriguez: And one -- just one other factor, because if you have any doubts about ADP\u2019s ability to drive margin, just one small thing hasn\u2019t come up yet. But we had this like small little problem this year with interest rates, where it created $110 million headwind to net contribution and 100 -- almost $125 million in topline and bottomline in terms of client funds interest revenue. So our revenue growth would have been almost a point higher and our margin for this year in a pandemic would have been up 70 basis points instead of downside 40 basis points, had we not had that headwind. Now, we did have a headwind. So it\u2019s always hard to say, if we didn\u2019t have this and we didn\u2019t have that. But that\u2019s a pretty easy thing to isolate that has no operational -- nothing to do with operations, we have no control over and we have to just ride that cyclical wave, which hopefully that\u2019s cyclical wave is heading in a very positive direction for us over the next two years to three years. But just want to make sure you understood that, because I think that tells you just how much control we have over our expenses and over our business model and over our long-term value creation objectives.\nKathleen Winters: And that perhaps our  interest does continue to be headwind for us in fiscal 2022, very modest headwinds, compared to what we experienced in fiscal 2021, but it doesn\u2019t help us, whereas in your past, it was a significant help to us.\nDan Dolev: Got it. Thank you for the detail. Appreciate it.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on your comments on retention and you\u2019re prudently planning for retention to increase if the market normalizes whether it does or not we\u2019ll see. But can you describe your toolkit on the sales or technology side that you can use to prevent attrition and I\u2019m sure a lot depends on the underlying sort of reasons for the attrition. But can you be more proactive on that front and sort of stem the tide of it if push comes to shove?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Absolutely. I think, and again, I -- we probably have a couple of examples we could give of things that we\u2019ve done over the last year. But it\u2019s usually a methodical multiyear approach to making our products like, when we talk about innovation. Innovation is partly about new business bookings, but it\u2019s also about making our solutions easy to use and more intuitive. And you\u2019ve heard in our comments and we shouldn\u2019t gloss over it, like, the UX experienced investments we\u2019ve made in both RUN, but now in some of our other platforms is a significant factor in today\u2019s world of whether or not a client sticks with you or not. So we get that. That\u2019s why, however, many years ago, we kind of got it, and we said, we need to become a technology company in addition to the services company that we are in. So I\u2019d say, number one is, you have to have great products, they have to be easy to use, and they have to have no friction. That will help with retention. I think the other things that I think you can point to are really just around availability. So our business model and our promise is not just technology and software, but it\u2019s to help with compliance and is to help with advice and is to provide expertise. And that really means that we have to have well trained associates, who are there to answer questions, whether it\u2019s chat, whether it\u2019s by phone, it doesn\u2019t matter, however, the client wants to reach us, but the stuff we do is complicated. And being an employer is complicated. And it requires help and you need to get the help from us or you can call an attorney, or you can call a consultant. But most people do not just do this stuff on their own and we happen to package the two things together, great technology with great service. So I say, if we have great technology and we have great service, we\u2019re going to be able to hold on to hopefully a lot of that improvement we\u2019ve had in retention, even if we have a little bit of give back in the down market.\nRamsey El-Assal: I see. Just not a question of running analytics at the right time, it\u2019s really more of a longer term kind of blocking and tackling and product innovation approach.\nCarlos Rodriguez: We run plenty of analytics too. So we have -- for example, we have a lot of data around, like, we track individual clients, how many times they call. We actually can monitor we have voice recognition that tells us, certain, keywords that people use when they\u2019re, because we record all phone calls and that really gives us deep insight into clients that are at risk. And then we have special teams that can follow up with those clients to make sure that whatever problem they had has been resolved. But that\u2019s -- I would call that trench warfare, which -- if you want to get into those details, I can go in the trenches with you. But we have very deep analytical tools that really give us a lot of insight. Like, for example, in our down market, I mean, our clients don\u2019t call that often, because hopefully they don\u2019t have problems very often, because we do a nice job of preventing problems. But one of our small business clients has -- we detect has multiple calls in a month, that requires a reach out to that client or a deeper investigation and a triage to make sure that we don\u2019t lose that client, because that\u2019s usually a sign that there\u2019s something wrong with that client. And we have other techniques and other approaches and other tools to identify what we would call hotspots. We also monitor pricing very carefully when we do our price changes, which I guess is code for price increases. We do that very carefully using a lot of analytical tools to make sure that we do that in the smartest possible way, if you will, to maximize retention.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. Thanks for that. And a quick follow up for me. How would you characterize the demand environment for off cycle or on-demand payrolls, is it something that that you see getting quite a bit more popular or it will sort of remain kind of a niche service over time?\nCarlos Rodriguez: No. I mean, it\u2019s clearly popular, because I know a lot of people are talking about it and so that always leads to popularity, right? As soon as someone talks about it, it becomes popular. I think that it\u2019s, again, like, a lot of things we\u2019ve been saying over the last two years or three years, so many things are inevitable are going to happen and we\u2019re preparing for them. So things like real time payroll. In this one that you\u2019re referring to is kind of one that we just heard over the last couple of days. I think that we\u2019ve been thinking about for many, many years and we have solutions, where if someone needs to get paid, like, for example, in California, if someone is terminated from their job, you have to give them their final paycheck like immediately and so that is difficult to do through the normal process. So we have solutions for that we\u2019ve had for quite some time. And so I think the increasing popularity is probably more related to increasing discussion about it, but also to technological advances that allow more options, right in terms of instant payments and/or faster payments. So I would say the answer is, yes. That is an important thing. And for certain sectors, like, if you have a high turnover, hourly workforce, your ability to provide that solution is crucial. But we have that ability to provide that solution. But you can\u2019t, for example, sell a client in California and not be able to provide instant pay upon termination. So it\u2019s -- you have to have that.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. All right. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from a line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nBryan Bergin: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about the cadence of the pays per control projecting, you\u2019ve assumed during fiscal 2022? And what does the 45% build imply in the base relative to pre-pandemic levels?\nCarlos Rodriguez: We\u2019re digging for that. I think the quarterly -- I mean, again, it\u2019s probably, when you look at the comps, the fourth quarter will have weaker than expected growth. But I don\u2019t know, Dan, if you have the\u2026\nDanyal Hussain: Yeah. Bryan, it\u2019s just a mirror image of what we saw effectively last year. And so there\u2019s a stronger Q1 performance PPC that\u2019s baked into our assumptions and it gradually tails off. But we don\u2019t have an explicit guidance for you on what this means for reported unemployment rate, the same way that we gave you that guidance last year at the outset.\nCarlos Rodriguez: And the average for the year for pays control, I am going to refresh my memory is\u2026\nDanyal Hussain: 4% to 5%...\nCarlos Rodriguez: 4% to 5%.\nKathleen Winters: Yeah.\nCarlos Rodriguez: So you -- I would anticipate, if I were you, I would probably assume that for the fourth quarter is going to be back to, I don\u2019t know, 2%, 3% or somewhere low -- somewhere in the lower range.\nDanyal Hussain: Absolutely.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Because we\u2019re growing over the 8% and in the first three quarters, particularly the first quarter it\u2019ll be higher.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. And follow up then on M&A. How are you thinking about areas of potential acquisitions for capabilities? And then also, can you comment on how the market has been for book of business acquisitions, curious COVID has changed that dynamic during fiscal 2021 and then to fiscal 2022?\nCarlos Rodriguez: We\u2019ve had actually pretty good success in terms of client base acquisitions. You -- again, you\u2019re right, that I myself was surprised that there was an opportunity to do that and then we were able to execute on it. But we had one that I think we mentioned last year, in the fourth quarter and kind of spilled a little bit over into the first quarter, but it was mostly I think fourth quarter. We had one the year before that, that was significant also in the fourth quarter. And in this year, we\u2019ve had a number of, what I would call, smaller ones, but they add up. And so I would say that the news there is good and is ongoing and we\u2019ve created a nice ability to do these conversions and make it good for us in terms of growth. And back to the question around cross-sell, we usually have a much broader set of solutions than other people that we are making these acquisitions from, which creates upside opportunity, right, in terms of value creation for us. On the kind of overall M&A comment side, I would say that, we\u2019ve -- where we\u2019ve been most active is looking in some of our international locations in markets, where I think we have very little market share and we still have needs, for example, for add-on products, whereas in the U.S., we\u2019re not really looking to add additional platforms for either benefits or payroll and so forth. So it really has to be things that are adjacent, right, in the HCM space, but not duplicative, because as you know, we\u2019ve been on this kind of simplification push for many, many years and trying to build things organically and invest in technology organically. So that doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t acquire because we have and a couple years -- we haven\u2019t done anything for a couple of years. But we do welcome the opportunity to add additional ancillary benefits as long as they fit into our technology roadmap and they\u2019re not disruptive or add-on and we\u2019re not doing it just to get the quote-unquote revenue pop. But on the international side, we typically don\u2019t have those factors at play as much and that\u2019s a place where we\u2019re still excited and we still see a lot of greenfield opportunity to expand through M&A.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.\nKartik Mehta: Good morning, Carlos. You talked about the PEO business, obviously, it performed well in the fourth quarter and seems like trends are coming back. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve seen any secular changes, I know that word maybe you don\u2019t like, but any secular changes in demand for the product, or if you anticipate any changes, because what we\u2019ve gone through with COVID?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I mean, again, my experience tells me that, because I actually ran a business for many years at ADP and now I\u2019ve been watching it for, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to say this for 25 years. And when you get into this kind of economic environment, it\u2019s usually a positive secular tailwind for, I guess, back to like, sometime I don\u2019t like that word. But I would say that there have been positive secular trends for the PEO for 20 years to 30 years. And then they can get enhanced, I think, by cyclical factors, like, a strong economy. Like, so people sometimes say that the PEO will do well or outsourcing will do well, when there\u2019s a recession, because people are looking to save money and that -- there\u2019s some truth to that. But it\u2019s not what the data supports or shows, right? It\u2019s usually when you have very strong economic growth and strong GDP and people are scrambling for talent and they\u2019re competing for offering the right benefits. That\u2019s when PEOs and outsourcing tend to, I think, do better. So I would say that, based on experience, which you have to discount, because we just went through a pandemic. So most of our experiences, we should park somewhere outside the door, because we may end up being wrong. But all things being equal this kind of economic environment is usually very strong for the PEO. And as for the last 18 months, what we saw there is, it\u2019s a long cycle sale and it\u2019s a high involvement decision. So I think we\u2019ve been clear that, we\u2019ve had good great results there from a booking standpoint, and probably, better than we would have thought was possible, but definitely not as strong as yet in kind of the early stages of the recovery of our bookings. We expect that to reverse and that is our plan in 2022. In other words, we expect very strong bookings and strong recovery on the PEO. And we\u2019re seeing some signs of that in the fourth quarter, because what happened is in this kind of hunkering down mode, we saw very high retention in our PEO, but not as much. It was more difficult to sell new clients, but the existing clients. I mean, it was unbelievable value that we delivered to them and because it was beyond just PPP loans. It was -- how do I downsize my workforce or how do I put people on furlough and what are the rules in this state around benefits. I mean, our people were busy. I mean all of our people or all of ADP were busy this year, while maybe other people were less busy, but our people were busy and in the PEO, they were extra busy. So I think that that bodes well. And those anecdotal stories and that reputation along with kind of some of these cyclical tailwinds, I think, bode well for the PEO here in the next year or two.\nKartik Mehta: And just as a follow up on the ES business, have you had to do anything out of the ordinary in terms of price competition or just providing promotions?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Have we done anything, are you saying or is the market?\nKartik Mehta: Yeah. I guess have you had to do anything to come from because of what competition has done? So have you had to do anything out of the ordinary on the ES business?\nCarlos Rodriguez: No.\nKartik Mehta: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is now open.\nMark Marcon: Hey. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for squeezing me in. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the strong bookings performance and just unpacking that, in terms of, where you -- I heard the 50-50 mix in terms of upsells versus new logos. But as it relates to new logos, where were you seeing the strongest success, was that down market in terms of the new business formations, was that across the Board and who do you think you were winning the most against?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, we would always squeeze you in Mark. There\u2019s no question about that. A couple of highlights. We think we mentioned in our prepared comments, but our non-PEO HRO solution. So these would be kind of mid-market and upmarket outsourcing solutions that are, what I would call more comprehensive, if you will. Really or probably one of the real highlights and I think that was, again, related probably to people realizing, probably, within months after the pandemic that, like this stuff is hard to do, especially if you have to pivot very quickly, right? You have to make sure your systems are still up like you can\u2019t have a server in a closet somewhere that you\u2019re using to run payroll, because you still do this internally. And then people who go to the office to key in the payroll, like this stuff is just a lot of people all of a sudden woke up and realized, from a business continuity standpoint and from a support standpoint, I need help, there needs to be more than just the software, right, and basic service. So these HRO solutions really were an incredible bright spot. And then, I think, definitely mentioned, our upmarket and our ESI bookings results were also very, very strong. Yes, new business formation helped in the down market and we\u2019re very -- like we\u2019re pleased with all of our results on booking side. It was across the Board very strong performance. But I would say that there were other places that had even stronger. When I talked about GlobalView, our Tax Filing and Compliance business, which does a lot of standalone business, where again, companies realize that having a bunch of people subscale doing this stuff, you don\u2019t even know where they are and if they can get to the office or if they can do it from home, but it\u2019s mission critical, are looking to outsource or did outsource a lot of that stuff to us. And then we did have a couple of, what I would call, volume-based businesses, like, employment verification and screening and a couple of things that, RPO also came back a little bit. But it was really across the Board, honestly, like. So those are a couple of just like\u2026\nKathleen Winters: Yeah. Like a strong across the Board, Carlos said all those right points, in particular SBS really led the way, down market really led the way in recovery during the course of the years. And in fact, and you can correct me if I\u2019m wrong on this, but I believe SBS had their biggest Q4 ever, including the Retirement and Insurance Solutions.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yeah. I wrote it down somewhere, but I can\u2019t find it. I think we had records Q4 bookings in a number of different categories. But that\u2019s also probably happens over the years to, where we have so many things were so broad, that there\u2019s always a few bright spots. But honestly, compared to what we would have expected the beginning of this year, really, to be saying we had record bookings in any business line is really good news.\nMark Marcon: Okay. That\u2019s fantastic. And just with regards to the new logos, in terms of if there wasn\u2019t moving to an outsourcing solution that was previously done in-house, was there any sort of commonality with regards to competitive takeaways and wins that you ended up seeing as a source?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I mean, I say that, when I looked -- when I look at the -- we call the balance of trade data. I would say that we -- again, I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re doing a little bit better. We don\u2019t provide a lot of color and disclosure around, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful and I\u2019m not looking to pick a fight with any specific competitor. But I would say that we\u2019re pleased with our progress, like, we need the combination of stronger retention, which means we lose less to some of those competitors that you\u2019re talking about and our strong bookings performance means we won more against some of those competitors. I think you\u2019d probably paint the picture that there\u2019s probably a few competitors where a balance of trade improved, which it did. And admittedly, in some couple of competitors, it didn\u2019t, right, it stayed. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really any place where we went backwards, that I\u2019m aware, I\u2019m trying to think back. But I think the balanced trade situation, we\u2019re very focused on this, we\u2019re trying to become more focused on logos and units and more focused on our competitors, because our competitors are focused on us and we\u2019re sick and tired of it.\nMark Marcon: Understood. And then, along those lines, you\u2019ve made a number of product enhancements. Can you highlight it, a number of them, including in terms of Workforce Solutions, Workforce Planning, time and attendance? And then, obviously, highlighting Next Gen Payroll, just wondering, which ones do you think are going to have the greatest incremental contribution? I know it\u2019s all leads to sales force productivity, but just, which ones should we look for the greatest benefit from?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, that\u2019s a tough one, because it\u2019s like picking your favorite child.\nKathleen Winters: Yeah. I mean, I have a view. I think what we do\u2026\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yeah.\nKathleen Winters: \u2026 from an investment perspective in ongoing kind of refresh and modernization, and you act on all of our strategic platforms is critical. And we\u2019re doing that all the time and that\u2019s just critical to our ongoing satisfaction with our products, as we talked about earlier and our NPS score. So that constant refresh from a UX perspective is really, really important. But, Carlos, you may have other things you want to just highlight\u2026\nCarlos Rodriguez: No. I think that\u2019s well said, because I\u2019m excited about all of them. I think that the Next Gen Payroll is literally could be the biggest mover in the last multiple decades for ADP for us. But it really -- it\u2019s really Workforce Now and Roll and other things that are in front of it that are critical and visible, right, because that\u2019s really just an engine to gross net engine. But the added flexibility that it provides and the process improvement that it provides in the back office could be a step change game changer for ADP in terms of our competitiveness and in terms of our efficiency. But the truth is, stay client focus, I think, Kathleen is right. The most important thing the client sees is what they interact with, right? And I think that is mostly around the UX and our front end solution. So I think that\u2019s probably the right place to focus.\nMark Marcon: Great. This Next Gen Payroll, what\u2019s the plan for this year in terms of percentage of Workforce Now that ends up getting converted or that should be on it?\nCarlos Rodriguez: We\u2019re not really -- we\u2019re probably dabbling in a few conversions, definitely not our number one priority yet. We started kind of in the lower end of our mid-market to begin with. So in call it the 50 to 150 is where we\u2019re really, we call it core major accounts kind of in the lower end of major accounts. And we\u2019re pretty happy as you can tell from our tone and what we\u2019ve talked about in the last couple of quarters with our progress there. And we have a plan. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really great for us to share it, because I think competitors listen to these calls, too. But we have a very methodical plan to eventually get to 100% of our core sales being a Next Gen Payroll, while at the same time, then gradually moving into the other parts of major accounts call it the 150 to 1000 and then selling 100% of those clients on to Next Gen Payroll. And then as we\u2019re going along, we will start some conversions. But it\u2019s not a huge priority for us, and remember Workforce Now is the front end on both of these. And this is all intended to be transparent. This is not one of those migrations that you heard about five years, seven years ago at ADP where we disrupt everything and that the clients are going to see very little change other than some enhancements in terms of self service capabilities. And other things that, obviously, we think are going to be net positives from both a selling and a client retention standpoint. But generally speaking, their experience will not change in a significant way.\nMark Marcon: Terrific. Congratulations.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, thanks. I appreciate everybody joining the call today. I think in the prepared comments we talked about what a year this has been. I\u2019m sure every company has the same view in terms of the challenges that they faced. But I\u2019m just incredibly grateful to our associates for what they did, first and foremost, for our clients. When the chips were down, we really delivered. It started, obviously, in the fourth quarter of last year with all the government regulation changes that needed to be put in place and the huge volume of inquiries we were getting about PPP loans, et cetera. But it really continued into this fiscal year as well. And it was just an incredibly challenging environment, while people have personal challenges, right, including health challenges in their family. And so, again, I\u2019m just -- I look back to, we\u2019re a mission driven company and you can see it in the in the culture and I\u2019m grateful for my predecessors and the culture that was built over all these decades that allowed us to, it wasn\u2019t without incident and it wasn\u2019t easy, but we really got through it. I think we delivered for our clients. We delivered for the economy, because we are a mission critical service in the economy. And I just couldn\u2019t be prouder of our associates including our back office associates to support our frontline associates, as well as our sales force, who, as we talked about a lot today, continue to plow through and allow us to continue to grow our business, despite we\u2019re unprecedented headwinds. So, but first and foremost, I\u2019m just so glad that despite, obviously, we have some short-term challenges here with the new Delta variant and so forth. But I mean, clearly, we\u2019re heading in the right direction and we are very optimistic both for ourselves, for our families, for our associates and for our clients and we look forward to better times ahead here over the next couple of quarters where inevitably we\u2019ll have some ups and downs or some challenges here and there. But it\u2019s great that everything is on the right track at least in the United States and we\u2019re hoping that other parts of the world follow closely behind, given that we have very significant business in Europe, Asia and Latin America as well. And we appreciate your interest in ADP and your support and thank you for tuning in today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.

            "name": "Kathleen Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter represented a strong close to the year, with 11% revenue growth on a reported basis and 9% growth on an organic constant currency basis, solidly ahead of our expectations. Our adjusted EBIT margin was down 120 basis points better than expected. And as a reminder, we did have some compare -- comparison pressure versus last year\u2019s lower selling and incentive compensation expenses that drove the comparative decline. Our 5% adjusted diluted EPS growth was strong, and in addition to the revenue and margin performance benefited from share repurchases. For our Employer Services segment, revenues increased 10% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic constant currency basis, as we lapped last year\u2019s pandemic affected Q4. We continued to see contributions from excellent retention, strong new business booking and growth in pays per control offset by lower client funds interest. ES margin was down 90 basis points due primarily to higher selling and incentive compensation expenses versus the prior year. Our PEO also had another very strong quarter. Average worksite employees increased to 616,000, up 12% on a year-over-year basis on both continued retention outperformance and contribution from solid employment growth. Our PEO revenue grew 12%, an impressive performance as we once again benefited from higher payroll for WSE, as well as stronger workers comp and SUI revenue for WSE compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower growth and zero margin pass-throughs. PEO margin was up 340 basis points in the quarter, due to an elevated worker\u2019s compensation reserve true-up last year. We were very pleased with our strong finish to the year. For fiscal 2021, a year heavily impacted by a pandemic, we drove strong bookings growth, solid 3% revenue growth, delivered positive EPS growth and continue to invest for sustainable growth and digital transformation. Yeah. I think that really covers a lot of that. I mean to kind of summarize and categorize what Carlos said, when you think about the complexity, number one, of being employer, the ongoing and pretty significant changes that we see from a regulatory standpoint. So complexity, regulatory change, the dynamic environment as the way people work and employer relationship -- employer employee relationship changes, it\u2019s a very dynamic environment. All of that is, you can just see in, the bookings number that we have. Our bookings, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get into the discussion on this, but the growth is pretty broad base. I mean, certainly, we saw some channels stronger than others, but it\u2019s pretty broad base. And I think that\u2019s because of all of this dynamic change and complexity that we see, and in particular, our comprehensive solutions that our outsourcing solutions have seen quite significant growth. So we\u2019re really encouraged about the macro trends that we see in the space. Yeah. They saw good momentum as we closed out the year. In fact, it was a particularly strong closed with a good number of multinational deals on GlobalView coming through at the end of the year and we\u2019re looking at fiscal 2022 for them to be a big contributor again. Yeah. I think the key is that we\u2019re going to have to make sure we can continue to be nimble just as we were in fiscal 2021, right? If there are certain regions or points in time where we might have to scale back a little bit in the face-to-face, I think we\u2019re nimble enough to do that. We\u2019ve proven we could do that. But we\u2019re certainly ready and have been out there doing face-to-face and hope that that continues. Yeah. I mean, that\u2019s covered a lot of. In fiscal 2021, look, we saw strong retention across almost all of our channels, our businesses, particularly in small business and mid-market as well, though, and even actually on the international side where the retention is very high. We thought it\u2019s a little bit higher there as well, too. So, pretty much strong across the Board. But look, we want to be prudent from a planning perspective and while we haven\u2019t seen any change yet in terms of switching or along those lines. I do think it\u2019s prudent to plan that there\u2019s going to be, I\u2019ll call it, a little bit of give back in fiscal 2022. I think we are going to hold on to some of the games. We\u2019re certainly attempting to do that. We want to do that. But I do think it\u2019s prudent to plan for a little bit of give back, which we\u2019ve done and that would be primarily with regard to small business segment normalizing back to pre-pandemic levels. Yeah. So just big picture when you think about margin for next year and we\u2019re very happy that we\u2019re able to kind of guide to the 25 basis points to 50 basis points of margin expansion, I mean, look, we always look to do better than the plan, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re comfortable with. Right now, the way to think about it is, look, we\u2019re going to have operating leverage to a greater extent in fiscal 2022, obviously, but we\u2019ve also got the investments that we want to continue to make, as Carlos just articulated, in product, in sales and in digital transformation importantly. And we do have some offsets, Carlos mentioned, the sales expense. But we also have things like, Return to Office and ramping up T&E versus what we were -- where we were in fiscal 2021. So kind of all that goes into the mix, net-net, we\u2019ve got this 25 basis points to 50 basis points margin expansion. We\u2019re going to do our best to deliver on that and continue to work our digital transformation and if possible do even more. And that perhaps our  interest does continue to be headwind for us in fiscal 2022, very modest headwinds, compared to what we experienced in fiscal 2021, but it doesn\u2019t help us, whereas in your past, it was a significant help to us. Yeah. Yeah. Like a strong across the Board, Carlos said all those right points, in particular SBS really led the way, down market really led the way in recovery during the course of the years. And in fact, and you can correct me if I\u2019m wrong on this, but I believe SBS had their biggest Q4 ever, including the Retirement and Insurance Solutions. Yeah. I mean, I have a view. I think what we do\u2026 \u2026 from an investment perspective in ongoing kind of refresh and modernization, and you act on all of our strategic platforms is critical. And we\u2019re doing that all the time and that\u2019s just critical to our ongoing satisfaction with our products, as we talked about earlier and our NPS score. So that constant refresh from a UX perspective is really, really important. But, Carlos, you may have other things you want to just highlight\u2026"

We reported very strong fourth quarter results, including 11% revenue growth and 5% adjusted diluted EPS growth, capping a year end which revenue and margin outperformed our expectations in every quarter. For the full year, we delivered 3% revenue growth, the high end of our guidance range, and I\u2019m happy to say, we reached $15 billion in revenue, a big milestone for the company. As we\u2019ve discussed all year, we took a consistent approach to investing this year, while also prudently managing expenses. As a result, our adjusted EBIT margin was down only slightly and we were able to deliver 2% adjusted diluted EPS growth for the year, ahead of our guidance and well ahead of our expectations at the start of the year. I\u2019ll first cover some highlights from the quarter. Our new business bookings results were very strong and our momentum in the market continues to build. Compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter, we grew our Employer Services New Business Bookings by 174%, which was slightly ahead of our expectations. And for the full year, we delivered 23% growth in ES bookings, towards the higher end of our guidance. We are very pleased with this outcome from our sales team, which booked $1.5 billion in new business in a year with a high degree of economic uncertainty. I think there are probably a couple of highlights. I think, Kathleen, probably has a couple of other, she would -- she can mention. But, like, I think, we mentioned in our prepared remarks, what we\u2019re seeing around Workforce Management in terms of time tracking and scheduling and so forth. We also mentioned some of the products we\u2019ve developed for Return to Workplace. So there are a number of things that are probably related to what\u2019s likely to be a more hybrid work environment for white collar employees at least on a go-forward basis, which probably requires people to think about their investments in HCM in terms of what they can do to maximize, the recruiting and the retention and the engagement of that hybrid workforce. So I think that is one. The other one is, there\u2019s always been a secular uptrend in terms of regulatory related and this is on a global basis, demand for HCM products. In other words, the more complexity there is around being an employer, the greater the demand for the wide array of services that we provide. That secular trend has probably gotten a bit of a boost based on in the U.S. the change in administrations, right, which we\u2019ve had that secular growth for seven years that ADP has existed. But there are times where it\u2019s stronger in terms of a tailwind and sometimes where it\u2019s weaker. And I would say that we\u2019re heading into strong secular tailwind here, as a result of some of the increased attention on regulatory actions. And you probably all saw, I think, it was yesterday, the day before, that the President signed number of executive orders, most of which are aimed at employer employee related relationships that increase the amount of tracking and reporting and compliance necessary on the part of employer. So those are a couple that I would mention. I think our retention rate also shows in -- an indirect way secular demand improving right in the sense that people have kind of rethought dropping or switching from their HCM vendors. But that one is a little difficult to be 100% sure about, because we do expect some normalization in that retention rate. And again, I think that, it\u2019s all -- I\u2019ve always never known what is defined the secular versus not secular. But the huge demand now for talent, what\u2019s happening in the labor markets. Obviously, that\u2019s a huge tailwind for all of us in the HCM space in terms of recruiting tools and engagement tools to try to hold on to people. But that could also be something that wanes in six months. That\u2019s -- that one\u2019s a little harder to tell. But generally speaking the war for talent has always been also a secular tailwind to our industry as well. Sure. So the -- actually I can probably give you a three that would probably account for kind of the way we think about this. So number one, obviously, is what we just talked about is the secular and cyclical tailwinds or headwinds. So if the economy continues with the momentum it\u2019s got, we\u2019re feeling pretty good. Obviously, if we end up having more challenges, because of the pandemic or otherwise, but right now the amount of -- even the existing government stimulus, even if there\u2019s no additional stimulus is pretty strong and also the pent-up demand and all these -- the reopening. That feels like a very good backdrop for us from a bookings growth standpoint. And then, as long as we have that background or that backdrop that\u2019s positive, it really comes down to really two things is sales force productivity at the Sales Quota Carrier level time, number of Sales Quota Carriers and I hate to be so simplistic, but at our size, because we have new products and we\u2019re rolling out, you heard how excited we are about all the new things that we\u2019re putting out there. But we sell a lot of business every year. So for a smaller company, when they end up having like a new product launch that can cause all kinds of growths, and by the way, likewise, if you don\u2019t have any new products. But for us, what I would consider to be a steady-eddy. So we really grow through methodically improving and adding new products, making talking acquisitions, et cetera, a lot of us. But the key formula for us is we cannot hit our sales plan unless we have the headcount and we are continually improving our sales force productivity and that\u2019s exactly what our plan is. And we have some good news over the last four quarters where our sales force productivity at the Average Quota Carrier level steadily improved throughout the year to reach 90% for the full year. But we exited the fourth quarter in kind of the mid-90%s, if you will, in comparison to pre-pandemic levels. So it feels like we\u2019re getting back to the quote-unquote trend from an average sales productivity standpoint and if we can get back to that trend, and we deliver on our hill -- on our headcount additions, we should be able to hit our new business bookings number. Yeah. So one of the -- in case somebody asked that we, one of the questions we sometimes get is and it\u2019s related to what you\u2019re asking is the mix of how much is new logo sales versus how much is add-on sales. And it\u2019s really been very steady over many years. It was only during the ACA period where we had a little bit of a tilt more towards incremental add-on sales. But it\u2019s -- for a long time been around 50-50 and it\u2019s still kind of in that neighborhood. So that I think bodes well because the more clients we add, the more opportunities we have pursue that land and expand, I think, approach that you just described. So I would say that, we\u2019re bullish on the opportunity to continue to go back to the new logos that we sold, which in many cases, we sell with multiple modules, but there\u2019s always additional room for new products as well to go back to that existing client base. So I think that underlying logo growth, I think, is another kind of supportive factor, if you will, for a new business bookings, because we do get about 50% of our bookings from our existing client base. It\u2019s actually a little bit of the opposite. Maybe we may have confused some people, I think, in prior calls. But I think, GlobalView is probably, could be at the top of our list in terms of performance this year, like, large multinational companies have been, I think, looking for ways. I think this pandemic rate -- raise probably some issues and concerns around control. I think for the HR leaders that probably raised some issues around engagement and making sure that you\u2019re connected to your global workforce and that you had global reporting, et cetera. So there\u2019s a lot of factors that probably went into what was incredibly strong demand and very positive sales growth. So I would say that, again, we don\u2019t disclose individual product lines, but I would say, the GlobalView sales were one of the stronger line items, I think, for us. And I\u2019ll add that to your question about differences between the businesses. I think all of our businesses really performed well. It\u2019s kind of hard, it really come down to trying to point out which ones were spectacular versus just good. And I would say that GlobalView and even our International business really were standouts and I -- really it\u2019s very impressive, because some of the situations in Europe, for example, were very challenging in terms of dealing with the pandemic, but I didn\u2019t really stop people from looking for solutions and it didn\u2019t stop our sales force from finding them, even though they had to do that from obviously from a remote workplace. So, I guess, summary is, GlobalView is a shining star for us. And again just -- the only -- again, it doesn\u2019t make a huge difference in the overall ADP revenue numbers. But these strong bookings remember will really translate into revenue and cause six months to 18 months, because these are large, typically large multinationals that take some time to implement. But that should be a positive thing for us kind of looking forward, if you will, in that six-month to 18-month horizon. Thank you. Well, I mean, I would probably put that in the bucket of secular tailwinds or cyclical tailwinds, depending on your view of whether it\u2019s short-term or long-term. But it does seem like if this kind of resolves itself, let\u2019s -- there\u2019s a couple scenarios, but if it\u2019s transitory in terms of the friction of getting people into the right job and then six months from now some of this has passed, by the time we get to that point, unemployment might be down into kind of the 4% to 5% range, which then creates a whole another wave of needs for employers in terms of finding talent and kind of fighting for talents over. So it feels to us like this is a multiyear cycle here where employers are going to be really scrambling to find people. I think that generally creates conversation opportunities. So we don\u2019t have a magic formula necessary, and necessarily, we\u2019re not a staffing firm. But we do have tools and we have technology, and we have people that can help our clients be more competitive as they look for solutions, as they look for the right employees in the right place at the right time at the right pay level. That\u2019s our sweet spot. And so I\u2019d say we\u2019re right in the middle of this, what I would call, super cycle of demand for labor that is probably short-term related to kind of friction where people are just not in the right places and people are probably also some -- there\u2019s some hesitation, still there\u2019s issues with childcare and eldercare, there\u2019s a number of factors. It is -- we assume like other economists that this will be -- that part will be transitory, but that the need for people will not be, given just the obvious low unemployment rate, which we will be at by the end of, call it, calendar year 2022. Again, this -- we\u2019re uncharted territory. It\u2019s a little hard to give a scientific answer, because this last year, we were not able to get in front of a lot of our process, actually most of our process until recently. And yeah, we delivered, I would say, very solid and strong bookings results. So I think some of this is really about us being able to adapt, which is our job to what the market wants, right, what the clients want and what the prospects want. And the fact of the matter is that about half of our -- half of the workforce out there, which probably translates into half of our clients, they actually kept going to workplaces, they kept making things, delivering things and going to workplaces. The rest of the some of us white collar employees didn\u2019t. So that segment of the prospects and clients, they expect us to be available, if they want us to meet with them in person. We\u2019re not going to go force anyone to meet in person. We\u2019re happy to meet them if they want to be met, whether it\u2019s virtually, online or in person. But we want to be ready for whatever the market wants and for whatever the market demands and that\u2019s exactly our plan. But to answer your question, it\u2019s really hard to know which factor is the most important factor. We think that being able and willing and available to meet in person with prospects is an important element of our sales success for fiscal 2022. But I can\u2019t really put a number on it because we were successful in 2021 without doing that. Thank you. That\u2019s a good question. I think, Kathleen, may probably have a little bit of additional color. But I would tell you that, this -- I think your insinuation that the PPP loans may have something to do with these elevated retention rates is something that we\u2019ve heard kind of out there in the -- in terms of as a buzz. And again, that\u2019s very hard to, like, put our finger on in terms of how to quantify that and what\u2019s the impact? But for sure, one of the strongest areas we\u2019ve had in retention is our down market business and that is why I think we\u2019ve prudently planned for some give back on that next year. Having said that, I will tell you that, this year, fiscal 2021 and the two months before that were probably the greatest example of ADP\u2019s business model in terms of ability to deliver. Now we call it service, you can call it compliance and call it whatever you want, but when the chips were down and people needed help and needed to talk to someone about their PPP loan and they weren\u2019t calling their banker, they didn\u2019t have to apply for a loan and they didn\u2019t have to go through a bank, but you can go do your own channel checks to see how many banks were actually answering the phone or giving people advice, because they were completely overwhelmed as we were, but we actually figured out a way to handle it and we were there for our clients. And so, I think that, what we just did over the last year and I get it I\u2019m a pragmatist, so memories are short and we have to continue to impress and continue to deliver for our clients. But I think we just proved to hundreds of thousands of clients, and hopefully, the prospects from a reputation standpoint that if you want to have someone who\u2019s a partner, if ADP, if you want software, you can buy software. But if you want great technology and great software, but you want someone who\u2019s going to be able to deliver on the service side, then you should be with ADP. And so I think that that\u2019s going to have some -- there\u2019s going to be some factor and hopefully allowing us to hold on to some of this retention on a more permanent basis, because I think the -- when the chips were down, I think, people saw the difference between not having someone that you could get help from and having someone that you can reach out to and get advice and get your problems -- major problem solved. But the bottomline is, we clearly are prudent and aware that some of this normalization could result in some lower retention rates, particularly in the down market, as you are, I think, alluding to. But to be clear, there\u2019s no -- I\u2019m not aware of a particular -- there\u2019s nothing that ties a client to us or anyone else because of the PPP loans. What I\u2019ve heard the theory that some people have somehow some kind of psychological thing that it\u2019ll just make things more difficult if you switch and I -- I\u2019m obviously not a small business owner. So we talk to small business owners. We\u2019re just not hearing that. But it feels logical that could be a factor of that. But to be clear, there is no particular trigger that on November 15th we\u2019re going to lose 100,000 clients because their PPP loans have been repaid or expired. That\u2019s not the way the program work. Well, listen, after 10 years of doing this, I\u2019ve never heard anyone say that your margin guidance was too aggressive and too high. So let me just start off with that comment. And part of that is that we\u2019re always trying to balance short-term and long-term investors. I\u2019m not sure which one you were hearing from. But our intent here is to continue the machine, right, and the momentum that has led to multiple decades here of compounded growth and creation of value over a very long period of time and that requires delivering short-term results, as well as long-term results. And those long-term results, I think, require some investment including on the R&D side. But in particular this year, really the biggest factor is selling expense and sales investment, which has happened to us in the past, we\u2019ve had other times and call it 2000, 2001 or 2002 and then, 2008, 2009, 2010, because I was around for those, where as we reaccelerate and take advantage of demand back to the secular growth opportunity. The way our business model works is we incur a lot of upfront selling and implementation expense. Now there\u2019s some accounting rules that allow you to defer some of that. But generally speaking, you get elevated selling expenses and implementation expenses, and it\u2019s pretty significant. So I would say that that is a significant part of what would have maybe otherwise been higher margins for 2022. But when that business then is on the books, that\u2019s a high incremental margin business that then in 2023, 2024 and then for the next 12 years to 13 years, that\u2019s how long we keep our clients on average creates an annuity. So as you can imagine, we never turn down the incremental opportunity to add business, never, because it is just the way the value creation model works. And we\u2019re going to make hay while the sun is shining here. And with 6%, 7% GDP growth last quarter and what\u2019s likely to be incredibly strong GDP in the next year or two, we\u2019re going to take every possible opportunity. And unfortunately, that requires some selling expense and some implementation expense in addition to the ongoing investments in technology and some of the other things that we do. And one -- just one other factor, because if you have any doubts about ADP\u2019s ability to drive margin, just one small thing hasn\u2019t come up yet. But we had this like small little problem this year with interest rates, where it created $110 million headwind to net contribution and 100 -- almost $125 million in topline and bottomline in terms of client funds interest revenue. So our revenue growth would have been almost a point higher and our margin for this year in a pandemic would have been up 70 basis points instead of downside 40 basis points, had we not had that headwind. Now, we did have a headwind. So it\u2019s always hard to say, if we didn\u2019t have this and we didn\u2019t have that. But that\u2019s a pretty easy thing to isolate that has no operational -- nothing to do with operations, we have no control over and we have to just ride that cyclical wave, which hopefully that\u2019s cyclical wave is heading in a very positive direction for us over the next two years to three years. But just want to make sure you understood that, because I think that tells you just how much control we have over our expenses and over our business model and over our long-term value creation objectives. Thank you. Absolutely. I think, and again, I -- we probably have a couple of examples we could give of things that we\u2019ve done over the last year. But it\u2019s usually a methodical multiyear approach to making our products like, when we talk about innovation. Innovation is partly about new business bookings, but it\u2019s also about making our solutions easy to use and more intuitive. And you\u2019ve heard in our comments and we shouldn\u2019t gloss over it, like, the UX experienced investments we\u2019ve made in both RUN, but now in some of our other platforms is a significant factor in today\u2019s world of whether or not a client sticks with you or not. So we get that. That\u2019s why, however, many years ago, we kind of got it, and we said, we need to become a technology company in addition to the services company that we are in. So I\u2019d say, number one is, you have to have great products, they have to be easy to use, and they have to have no friction. That will help with retention. I think the other things that I think you can point to are really just around availability. So our business model and our promise is not just technology and software, but it\u2019s to help with compliance and is to help with advice and is to provide expertise. And that really means that we have to have well trained associates, who are there to answer questions, whether it\u2019s chat, whether it\u2019s by phone, it doesn\u2019t matter, however, the client wants to reach us, but the stuff we do is complicated. And being an employer is complicated. And it requires help and you need to get the help from us or you can call an attorney, or you can call a consultant. But most people do not just do this stuff on their own and we happen to package the two things together, great technology with great service. So I say, if we have great technology and we have great service, we\u2019re going to be able to hold on to hopefully a lot of that improvement we\u2019ve had in retention, even if we have a little bit of give back in the down market. We run plenty of analytics too. So we have -- for example, we have a lot of data around, like, we track individual clients, how many times they call. We actually can monitor we have voice recognition that tells us, certain, keywords that people use when they\u2019re, because we record all phone calls and that really gives us deep insight into clients that are at risk. And then we have special teams that can follow up with those clients to make sure that whatever problem they had has been resolved. But that\u2019s -- I would call that trench warfare, which -- if you want to get into those details, I can go in the trenches with you. But we have very deep analytical tools that really give us a lot of insight. Like, for example, in our down market, I mean, our clients don\u2019t call that often, because hopefully they don\u2019t have problems very often, because we do a nice job of preventing problems. But one of our small business clients has -- we detect has multiple calls in a month, that requires a reach out to that client or a deeper investigation and a triage to make sure that we don\u2019t lose that client, because that\u2019s usually a sign that there\u2019s something wrong with that client. And we have other techniques and other approaches and other tools to identify what we would call hotspots. We also monitor pricing very carefully when we do our price changes, which I guess is code for price increases. We do that very carefully using a lot of analytical tools to make sure that we do that in the smartest possible way, if you will, to maximize retention. No. I mean, it\u2019s clearly popular, because I know a lot of people are talking about it and so that always leads to popularity, right? As soon as someone talks about it, it becomes popular. I think that it\u2019s, again, like, a lot of things we\u2019ve been saying over the last two years or three years, so many things are inevitable are going to happen and we\u2019re preparing for them. So things like real time payroll. In this one that you\u2019re referring to is kind of one that we just heard over the last couple of days. I think that we\u2019ve been thinking about for many, many years and we have solutions, where if someone needs to get paid, like, for example, in California, if someone is terminated from their job, you have to give them their final paycheck like immediately and so that is difficult to do through the normal process. So we have solutions for that we\u2019ve had for quite some time. And so I think the increasing popularity is probably more related to increasing discussion about it, but also to technological advances that allow more options, right in terms of instant payments and/or faster payments. So I would say the answer is, yes. That is an important thing. And for certain sectors, like, if you have a high turnover, hourly workforce, your ability to provide that solution is crucial. But we have that ability to provide that solution. But you can\u2019t, for example, sell a client in California and not be able to provide instant pay upon termination. So it\u2019s -- you have to have that. We\u2019re digging for that. I think the quarterly -- I mean, again, it\u2019s probably, when you look at the comps, the fourth quarter will have weaker than expected growth. But I don\u2019t know, Dan, if you have the\u2026 And the average for the year for pays control, I am going to refresh my memory is\u2026 4% to 5%. So you -- I would anticipate, if I were you, I would probably assume that for the fourth quarter is going to be back to, I don\u2019t know, 2%, 3% or somewhere low -- somewhere in the lower range. Because we\u2019re growing over the 8% and in the first three quarters, particularly the first quarter it\u2019ll be higher. We\u2019ve had actually pretty good success in terms of client base acquisitions. You -- again, you\u2019re right, that I myself was surprised that there was an opportunity to do that and then we were able to execute on it. But we had one that I think we mentioned last year, in the fourth quarter and kind of spilled a little bit over into the first quarter, but it was mostly I think fourth quarter. We had one the year before that, that was significant also in the fourth quarter. And in this year, we\u2019ve had a number of, what I would call, smaller ones, but they add up. And so I would say that the news there is good and is ongoing and we\u2019ve created a nice ability to do these conversions and make it good for us in terms of growth. And back to the question around cross-sell, we usually have a much broader set of solutions than other people that we are making these acquisitions from, which creates upside opportunity, right, in terms of value creation for us. On the kind of overall M&A comment side, I would say that, we\u2019ve -- where we\u2019ve been most active is looking in some of our international locations in markets, where I think we have very little market share and we still have needs, for example, for add-on products, whereas in the U.S., we\u2019re not really looking to add additional platforms for either benefits or payroll and so forth. So it really has to be things that are adjacent, right, in the HCM space, but not duplicative, because as you know, we\u2019ve been on this kind of simplification push for many, many years and trying to build things organically and invest in technology organically. So that doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t acquire because we have and a couple years -- we haven\u2019t done anything for a couple of years. But we do welcome the opportunity to add additional ancillary benefits as long as they fit into our technology roadmap and they\u2019re not disruptive or add-on and we\u2019re not doing it just to get the quote-unquote revenue pop. But on the international side, we typically don\u2019t have those factors at play as much and that\u2019s a place where we\u2019re still excited and we still see a lot of greenfield opportunity to expand through M&A. I mean, again, my experience tells me that, because I actually ran a business for many years at ADP and now I\u2019ve been watching it for, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to say this for 25 years. And when you get into this kind of economic environment, it\u2019s usually a positive secular tailwind for, I guess, back to like, sometime I don\u2019t like that word. But I would say that there have been positive secular trends for the PEO for 20 years to 30 years. And then they can get enhanced, I think, by cyclical factors, like, a strong economy. Like, so people sometimes say that the PEO will do well or outsourcing will do well, when there\u2019s a recession, because people are looking to save money and that -- there\u2019s some truth to that. But it\u2019s not what the data supports or shows, right? It\u2019s usually when you have very strong economic growth and strong GDP and people are scrambling for talent and they\u2019re competing for offering the right benefits. That\u2019s when PEOs and outsourcing tend to, I think, do better. So I would say that, based on experience, which you have to discount, because we just went through a pandemic. So most of our experiences, we should park somewhere outside the door, because we may end up being wrong. But all things being equal this kind of economic environment is usually very strong for the PEO. And as for the last 18 months, what we saw there is, it\u2019s a long cycle sale and it\u2019s a high involvement decision. So I think we\u2019ve been clear that, we\u2019ve had good great results there from a booking standpoint, and probably, better than we would have thought was possible, but definitely not as strong as yet in kind of the early stages of the recovery of our bookings. We expect that to reverse and that is our plan in 2022. In other words, we expect very strong bookings and strong recovery on the PEO. And we\u2019re seeing some signs of that in the fourth quarter, because what happened is in this kind of hunkering down mode, we saw very high retention in our PEO, but not as much. It was more difficult to sell new clients, but the existing clients. I mean, it was unbelievable value that we delivered to them and because it was beyond just PPP loans. It was -- how do I downsize my workforce or how do I put people on furlough and what are the rules in this state around benefits. I mean, our people were busy. I mean all of our people or all of ADP were busy this year, while maybe other people were less busy, but our people were busy and in the PEO, they were extra busy. So I think that that bodes well. And those anecdotal stories and that reputation along with kind of some of these cyclical tailwinds, I think, bode well for the PEO here in the next year or two. Have we done anything, are you saying or is the market? No. Well, we would always squeeze you in Mark. There\u2019s no question about that. A couple of highlights. We think we mentioned in our prepared comments, but our non-PEO HRO solution. So these would be kind of mid-market and upmarket outsourcing solutions that are, what I would call more comprehensive, if you will. Really or probably one of the real highlights and I think that was, again, related probably to people realizing, probably, within months after the pandemic that, like this stuff is hard to do, especially if you have to pivot very quickly, right? You have to make sure your systems are still up like you can\u2019t have a server in a closet somewhere that you\u2019re using to run payroll, because you still do this internally. And then people who go to the office to key in the payroll, like this stuff is just a lot of people all of a sudden woke up and realized, from a business continuity standpoint and from a support standpoint, I need help, there needs to be more than just the software, right, and basic service. So these HRO solutions really were an incredible bright spot. And then, I think, definitely mentioned, our upmarket and our ESI bookings results were also very, very strong. Yes, new business formation helped in the down market and we\u2019re very -- like we\u2019re pleased with all of our results on booking side. It was across the Board very strong performance. But I would say that there were other places that had even stronger. When I talked about GlobalView, our Tax Filing and Compliance business, which does a lot of standalone business, where again, companies realize that having a bunch of people subscale doing this stuff, you don\u2019t even know where they are and if they can get to the office or if they can do it from home, but it\u2019s mission critical, are looking to outsource or did outsource a lot of that stuff to us. And then we did have a couple of, what I would call, volume-based businesses, like, employment verification and screening and a couple of things that, RPO also came back a little bit. But it was really across the Board, honestly, like. So those are a couple of just like\u2026 Yeah. I wrote it down somewhere, but I can\u2019t find it. I think we had records Q4 bookings in a number of different categories. But that\u2019s also probably happens over the years to, where we have so many things were so broad, that there\u2019s always a few bright spots. But honestly, compared to what we would have expected the beginning of this year, really, to be saying we had record bookings in any business line is really good news. I mean, I say that, when I looked -- when I look at the -- we call the balance of trade data. I would say that we -- again, I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re doing a little bit better. We don\u2019t provide a lot of color and disclosure around, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful and I\u2019m not looking to pick a fight with any specific competitor. But I would say that we\u2019re pleased with our progress, like, we need the combination of stronger retention, which means we lose less to some of those competitors that you\u2019re talking about and our strong bookings performance means we won more against some of those competitors. I think you\u2019d probably paint the picture that there\u2019s probably a few competitors where a balance of trade improved, which it did. And admittedly, in some couple of competitors, it didn\u2019t, right, it stayed. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really any place where we went backwards, that I\u2019m aware, I\u2019m trying to think back. But I think the balanced trade situation, we\u2019re very focused on this, we\u2019re trying to become more focused on logos and units and more focused on our competitors, because our competitors are focused on us and we\u2019re sick and tired of it. Well, that\u2019s a tough one, because it\u2019s like picking your favorite child. Yeah. No. I think that\u2019s well said, because I\u2019m excited about all of them. I think that the Next Gen Payroll is literally could be the biggest mover in the last multiple decades for ADP for us. But it really -- it\u2019s really Workforce Now and Roll and other things that are in front of it that are critical and visible, right, because that\u2019s really just an engine to gross net engine. But the added flexibility that it provides and the process improvement that it provides in the back office could be a step change game changer for ADP in terms of our competitiveness and in terms of our efficiency. But the truth is, stay client focus, I think, Kathleen is right. The most important thing the client sees is what they interact with, right? And I think that is mostly around the UX and our front end solution. So I think that\u2019s probably the right place to focus. We\u2019re not really -- we\u2019re probably dabbling in a few conversions, definitely not our number one priority yet. We started kind of in the lower end of our mid-market to begin with. So in call it the 50 to 150 is where we\u2019re really, we call it core major accounts kind of in the lower end of major accounts. And we\u2019re pretty happy as you can tell from our tone and what we\u2019ve talked about in the last couple of quarters with our progress there. And we have a plan. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really great for us to share it, because I think competitors listen to these calls, too. But we have a very methodical plan to eventually get to 100% of our core sales being a Next Gen Payroll, while at the same time, then gradually moving into the other parts of major accounts call it the 150 to 1000 and then selling 100% of those clients on to Next Gen Payroll. And then as we\u2019re going along, we will start some conversions. But it\u2019s not a huge priority for us, and remember Workforce Now is the front end on both of these. And this is all intended to be transparent. This is not one of those migrations that you heard about five years, seven years ago at ADP where we disrupt everything and that the clients are going to see very little change other than some enhancements in terms of self service capabilities. And other things that, obviously, we think are going to be net positives from both a selling and a client retention standpoint. But generally speaking, their experience will not change in a significant way. Thank you. Well, thanks. I appreciate everybody joining the call today. I think in the prepared comments we talked about what a year this has been. I\u2019m sure every company has the same view in terms of the challenges that they faced. But I\u2019m just incredibly grateful to our associates for what they did, first and foremost, for our clients. When the chips were down, we really delivered. It started, obviously, in the fourth quarter of last year with all the government regulation changes that needed to be put in place and the huge volume of inquiries we were getting about PPP loans, et cetera. But it really continued into this fiscal year as well. And it was just an incredibly challenging environment, while people have personal challenges, right, including health challenges in their family. And so, again, I\u2019m just -- I look back to, we\u2019re a mission driven company and you can see it in the in the culture and I\u2019m grateful for my predecessors and the culture that was built over all these decades that allowed us to, it wasn\u2019t without incident and it wasn\u2019t easy, but we really got through it. I think we delivered for our clients. We delivered for the economy, because we are a mission critical service in the economy. And I just couldn\u2019t be prouder of our associates including our back office associates to support our frontline associates, as well as our sales force, who, as we talked about a lot today, continue to plow through and allow us to continue to grow our business, despite we\u2019re unprecedented headwinds. So, but first and foremost, I\u2019m just so glad that despite, obviously, we have some short-term challenges here with the new Delta variant and so forth. But I mean, clearly, we\u2019re heading in the right direction and we are very optimistic both for ourselves, for our families, for our associates and for our clients and we look forward to better times ahead here over the next couple of quarters where inevitably we\u2019ll have some ups and downs or some challenges here and there. But it\u2019s great that everything is on the right track at least in the United States and we\u2019re hoping that other parts of the world follow closely behind, given that we have very significant business in Europe, Asia and Latin America as well. And we appreciate your interest in ADP and your support and thank you for tuning in today."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, my name is Crystal, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks and will be a question-and-answer session.  Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanyal Hussain: Thank you, Crystal. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining ADP's third quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call and webcast. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. And with that let me turn it over to Carlos.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you, Danny. And thank you everyone for joining our call. This morning, we reported another strong set of quarterly results that were ahead of our expectations. With revenue growth of 1% and adjusted EBIT margin down 90 basis points, combining for a modest adjusted diluted EPS decline of 2%. This of course was the final quarter, before we begin to lap the impact of the pandemic, and I'm very proud of our organization's ability to have delivered positive revenue and earnings growth for the first nine months of the fiscal year despite unprecedented challenges in the economy and the labor markets. I'll start with a review of some of our key performance drivers and an update on the operating environment, we've been experiencing. This quarter, our Employer Services New Business Bookings reaccelerated and we delivered 7% growth, a strong result for the team. The improved year-over-year growth compared to the second quarter was driven by every business unit. Importantly, we ended the quarter on a particularly strong note with record March sales performance that was well above pre-pandemic fiscal 2019 levels, which we see as a positive signal for client engagement in the quarters ahead. The selling environment will likely continue to evolve, month-to-month, and with differences on a regional basis as COVID cases and the reopening trajectories stabilize. We are optimistic that with vaccine deployment progressing steadily, our clients are in the best position since the pandemic started to begin making buying decisions again.\nKathleen Winters: Thank you, Carlos, and good morning everyone. Q3 represented another strong quarter for us with our performance on both revenues and margins driven by excellent execution across the organization. Our revenues grew 1% on both a reported and organic constant currency basis, which represented a slight acceleration versus Q2. We delivered this growth despite incremental drag from client funds interest versus Q2, as well as some incremental pressure related to our usual seasonal Q3 revenue drivers such as annual W-2 Form. I'll share more on these in a moment. As anticipated, we also experienced a margin decline as we continued to make additional growth in productivity investments and as we experienced a more significant client funds interest revenue decline compared to prior quarters, but the 90 basis points of margin decline was better than our expectations. Combining this revenue and margin performance, our adjusted EBIT was down 2% to $1.1 billion. Our adjusted effective tax rate increased slightly compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020, as we had less contribution from excess tax benefit on stock comp, but our share count was lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases, and as a result, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.89 was down a modest 2% versus last year. For our Employer Services segment, revenues declined 1% on a reported basis and 2% on an organic constant currency basis, demonstrating steady growth rates compared to last quarter, despite additional pressure from two sources as I just mentioned, both of which were fully anticipated. First, with greater pressure from client funds interest, our Q3 has a seasonally larger client funds balance than other quarters of the year and as a result, it skews more to cash and cash equivalent investments where interest rates have been pushed down to near zero. As a result, our client funds interest declined 32% versus last year with average yield down 70 basis points, more than offsetting our strong balance growth, which improved to 6%. Second with the headwind related to seasonal Q3 revenues like the annual Form W-2 which effectively makes our Q3 slightly more sensitive to pays per control and employment turnover trends and other quarters. Looking past these two headwinds, underlying ES performance showed sequential improvement driven in part by continued record level retention that was partially offset by slightly lower than expected pays per control. Employer Services Q3 margin was down 120 basis points compared to last year ahead of our expectations. We continue to invest in headcount to support our growing client base. We also started lapping lower incentive costs from last year and we experienced greater pressure from the lower client funds interest revenue compared to the first half of this year. But at the same time we kept our focus on prudent cost control and continue to execute on our transformation initiatives.\nOperator:  And we will take our first question from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question this morning. I wanted to ask about the increase in person engagement with the sales force, can you kind of contrast for us the productivity you're seeing from those in-person meetings relative to the remote meetings? Is that something that we should consider to be an incremental sort of driver of productivity maybe beyond what we were expecting, as we go forward?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, I think that's right. I think you would look at it really as incremental, because if you recall, like our first quarter, we had pretty robust sales results really with almost 100% of our sales force working virtually at that at that point. So we expect that the increased activity, if you listen to the tone of our comments that it's really incremental and hopefully gets us quickly back to the same productivity levels we were pre-pandemic, which we were approaching in the third and fourth quarter here, and then hopefully beyond that, because obviously part of our model before was that we expected some incremental improvement in productivity each year, in addition to increases in headcount and when you have combine those factors in addition to kind of new products and other things, that's what kind of drove our new business bookings growth, the combination of increases in headcount, and increases in productivity. So you're right, that's the path is this will help us get quickly back to our previous productivity and hopefully allow us to get above that, which is I think, important for us in terms of our long-term growth expectations.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. And I wonder if you could comment too, on the environment around potential tax reforms. As I recall when the corporate tax rates fell, that was translated into lower client interest balances for you or client funds balances for you. I know it's early days and everything needs to move through Congress, but can you comment on the degree to which some of these changes may or may not be factored in your budgeting process or what you're expecting here in terms of tax changes going forward in the impact on your business?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think for corporate, I think, if you're referring to really was clearly on the team, we've -- there's a lot of discussion about a lot of different things, including an increase in the kind of tax rate for the higher income individuals. But right now from -- And there's obviously discussion about capital gains taxes as well. But right now the thing that is probably most prevalent in discussions is corporate income tax rate, and I'm trying to think through I don't believe that there has really any direct impact on our balances obviously have an impact on ADP corporate itself, but I don't think that you have.\nDanyal Hussain: Yes, you're definitely right about the individual tax brackets having an impact on our float balance. So, back when we had the previous corporate tax reform in the individual bracket changes, it was a headwind. I think about a percentage point or in that ballpark. So, in theory, what will drive the tailwind to our growth will depend on the actual change in rates here and what that means for overall individual income taxes. So it would be a contribution is not factored in to our outlook at this time, but obviously it's something we would benefit from.\nRamsey El-Assal: Terrific, thanks for taking my questions this morning.\nDanyal Hussain: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Mizuho. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I got -- just a quick housekeeping and then longer-term strategic question. You guiding I think to 4Q EPS slightly below the Street. Is there any margin pressure to call out in the fourth quarter?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, I think if you -- from our prepared comments, you'd probably see that the pressures are what I would call self-inflicted in the sense that we believe is an opportunity for us to make some investments that improve our long-term growth prospects, both for '22 and beyond. And I think Kathleen particularly mentioned the two or three things that we're investing. And so the answer is no, there's no kind of mysterious margin pressure. In other words, the business continues to move in the right trajectory like almost every metric we have has improved in fact I say every metric we have has improved sequentially, even the pays per control, even though it was modest, it's still rounded to 6% down. We know now after watching the data at the beginning of Q4 that that's heading in the right direction and we can all tell from what's happening with unemployment but that-- that's going to also continue to improve fairly quickly here. So when you really kind of add it all together, like we're in a very strong position have very strong momentum and people who have known us for a long time, know that when we experience that we try to reinvest some of that and I think that's exactly what you're seeing in the fourth quarter. So I would say that those are conscious decisions that we are making.\nDan Dolev: Yes.\nKathleen Winters: And that's exactly right. And I'll just add in, in addition to what I think is smartly doing those investments in the fourth quarter and accelerating some of that, we've also got some year-over-year comp things going on right? As you would expect with selling having been down Q4 last year versus Q4 this year, we'd see incremental year-over-year selling expense in Q4 as well.\nDan Dolev: Got it. And just my follow up is, it was very impressed to see bookings kind of back to fiscal '19 levels. Really strong. Can you maybe talk a little bit about how Next-Gen Payroll engine is helping bookings?\nCarlos Rodriguez: It's a relatively modest contribution because despite our level of excitement about really all of our Next-Gen platforms and even Roll, which you could argue that that's a NextGen solution as well. Again it's just because of the size and scale of our company like right now from a dollar impact standpoint, it's really not, that's not what's moving the needle really across the board, really in every business unit in every channel and every category, our bookings have been improving again sequentially every quarter and they continue to do that this quarter. So we believe that medium to long term, that's the key to us, sustaining kind of our multi-decade growth rates is these Next-gen platforms, but I just continue to caution everyone to because we want to give you the updates and we want to continue to focus on next-gen and I like, I appreciate the question important to kind of separate what's driving the quarters and what's driving the next fiscal year versus what's driving the next three to five years. And I would say that Next-gen payroll is going to be increasingly important in the next year or two from a bookings standpoint and we'll start to probably make a difference and will then give you that color in terms of what difference its making, but we should be cautious about revenue impact, just because of the recurring revenue model just takes a while for that to get into the revenue growth numbers, but it was positive, but really not. Now, we're really moved the needle.\nDanyal Hussain: And I would just add that. We shared that we sold hundreds of clients on our Next-Gen Payroll engine with Workforce Now, just for context, that compares to typically few thousand clients that we sell in the mid-market. So it's still a piece of the overall puzzle. But as that scale to become the majority and then ultimately, all of our mid-market sales then you truly feel the incremental benefit.\nDan Dolev: Got it. So...\nCarlos Rodriguez: That come is really the message there.\nDan Dolev: Thank you. Great stuff. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nEugene Simuni: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So I wanted to ask about down market and great to see the introduction of Roll to target the micro customers. I was hoping you can speak a little bit more broadly about evolution of competitive landscape through the pandemic down market, how RUN has done and kind of coming out of the pandemic, what opportunities exist for ADP to continue gaining share in the segment as I believe it has done prior to the pandemic?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, I mean I think there is a number of moving parts. And I think it probably depends on people's current business model. So, as you know, our business model is really more about providing not just a software-based to support right support you call service, you can call it compliance, and I think what we saw this year with all of the activity that the government had around the various stimulus programs to help companies and individuals and so we're that created a lot of complexity for employers, it appears that we're entering into an environment where despite the pandemic hopefully fading, there will be increased levels of government activity around employment and incentives and that kind of that kind of thing. I think that's a good environment for ADP and for our down market business because most small businesses, don't have the time or the inclination to really focus on these things and to take care of these things. So it works for some clients and we believe that that's why we're rolling out Roll, no pun intended, but once you get to even a little bit slightly larger you do end up running into issues that you need help with and you need support and you need advice and much of that can be automated, but you still need it. So for example, a lot of our PPP support reports were automated. So it doesn't mean that somebody has to get on the phone and have a discussion about your PPP report, but you have to be focused on providing the support and the compliance in addition to just the software. So I think that helped us this year and again, so to answer your question, how do we believe we're set up competitively right now? I think we're set up excellently, competitively, because we now have very simple solutions for the micro-market where people want to self-buy, self-install, and don't have complexity and maybe don't have issues with taxes or compliance or don't want to ask questions, because it's not priced or built to ask questions. But we also have the ability to provide this assistance that is important for even small clients for sure it's important for mid-sized clients and for larger clients, but I think what really got highlighted this year is that small clients need a lot of help and need a lot of assistance and you can see it in our growth rates in our retention in our client satisfaction, like in all of our metrics in our small business division that we happen to be in the right place at the right time I think to be able to help our clients and then hopefully no benefit from the tailwind of the demand that that's going to create on a go-forward basis. So anyway long-winded way of saying, I think we're in a great position, because of our business model.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Excellent. And then a quick follow-up from me on the global business. So just thinking about what we're seeing now, I think is strong kind of bifurcation of the recoveries in the US and abroad. Strong expectations for US recovery in your business in Global, is it growing, is it going slower? And is the implication that global might be kind of headwind to growth over the next couple of quarters?\nDanyal Hussain: As usual for us, things are a little more when you peel the onion back, there is a little bit more complexity because you're just the image you have is correct, but it hasn't really, translated into the results, our results have actually been quite good internationally, both in terms of bookings as well as just the performance of the business overall in terms of revenue, pays per control et cetera. Some of that is that a large portion of our business is in Europe and there were a lot of government programs there as well to help companies and to prevent high levels of unemployment. And so for example, our pays per control metric never got to the negative levels that we saw in the US, in Europe, so that was a benefit. At the same time, our bookings have been quite strong and I have to admit that I've been looking for the explanation for that other than really good execution on the part of our sales force as they moved into a virtual environment because they had to sell virtually there as well. But I would say it's strong differentiation of our products. Again, the service aspect to our solutions, the ability to provide support and to provide compliance and help, all of those things probably helped our bookings performance internationally as well. So I would say that our global business actually is probably one of the bright spots. I would say despite what is obviously a very difficult environment, and we obviously feel for our businesses in not just Europe which now it happens to be improving again, particularly in the UK, but we're having challenges now in Toronto, we're having in Canada and in Brazil, we're having challenges. Obviously, as you know in India as well. But it's, it has not translated into negative results. So I think it's a testament to the resiliency and the strength of the business model. But I don't want to take anything away from the fact that it also obviously shows great execution by our international leaders as well.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Your line is open. Please check that, your line is not on mute.\nBryan Bergin: Sorry about that. Question for you on ES versus PEO performance. It seems like pays per control appear to be a key difference, can you just dig in more on the at the mix aspects that seem to drive a pretty notable disparity of performance between those two. And should we expect that difference to persist in 4Q? Or do you expect more even performance?\nDanyal Hussain: I don't believe we've provided Lake that data, so I'm surprised you came to that conclusion but we maybe it's part of our tone. So there isn't a huge difference between ES pays per control performance and PEO, they both have been improving every quarter sequentially and the PEO doesn't include -- we generally stay away from very, very small clients. So we don't have a lot of clients that are one to two employees or five employees. The average size client in the PEO, I think is somewhere around 40, and so by definition, it tends to skew a little bit bigger than maybe our average client size for sure for small business, so actually, I'm looking at these figures last night. And it makes perfect sense kind of where we are, which is that the PEO is performing a little bit better in terms of absolute level of pays per control and have been improving sequentially just as ES has as well. So, and again I'm probably not allowed to say this, I'm going to get in trouble, but last night I got a note from the PEO that we experienced the first positive pays per control week. Now, the problem with pays per control is that it does vary based on payroll cycles. So if you have weekly payrolls or by-weekly payroll so you and I can't read anything into that. It's the first time we've had a positive pays per control in any week over the last 12 months. So that's a very positive sign.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. And then just on margins, you should outperformance here in the quarter. But at the same time you've called out incremental headcount investments higher incentive comp, and I think elevated implementation costs, can you just talk about the drivers there and then how do we connect the elevated implementation cost with more efficient digital onboarding commentary?\nDanyal Hussain: Well, the efficient digital onboarding, I think, we were pretty clear with a FPS, we would love to, at some point in the future, extend that into the mid-market and maybe someday into the upmarket. But as you know, like you know better than us, because you've talked a lot of the competitors, there's not a lot of digital on-boarding going on for example of large complex ERP installations, not to pick on any competitors, but it's pretty. I know the images that the stuff, all kinds of its installed itself, but most of many of our competitors use third-parties. So there is still quite a lot of implementation activity and expense, whether it's done by the seller of the solutions or if it's done by a third-party. We haven't have a model where we do a lot of it ourselves. And so as bookings pick up and demand picks up, we need to add to our capacity for implementation in particular in the mid-market, the upmarket and also global, which as I mentioned has been strong. So it doesn't mean that we're not adding in the down market also. But in our small business segment as we alluded to, and as I think you pointed out, the digital on-boarding capabilities obviously reduce the need to grow headcount as much as we otherwise would have. But even in small business, we have a lot of growth in bookings and so it's a matter of the trade-off of how much can we on-board digitally versus how much we still need some help with, in terms of people being involved in. In terms of some of the other items that, we alluded to, I mean, some of this is just kind of natural to the business model, as we bring on more clients, we obviously expect productivity improvements every year, whether it's in sales or implementation or everywhere, but we are seeing a recovery of our business and very strong GDP forecast, and so, we're anticipating improved prospects for bookings and for revenue and for growth, and we need to make sure that we have the right staffing levels based on the productivity metrics that and the productivity goals that we have to be able to handle that business, so we can maintain our high clients of level -- high level of client satisfaction that we've, that we've experienced. And then we have some natural growth in expenses like I think Kathleen alluded to sales expense is clearly something that grows as you have sales success and as sales grow year-over-year. So I wouldn't, I wouldn't read too much into it rather than that, we made some conscious decisions to reinvest in some specific things in the fourth quarter to really position us well for 22 and beyond, but most of this is just kind of natural stuff where, again, as our revenue growth picks up over time, we still have a great incremental margin business where we would expect to have good operating leverage as we grow those revenues.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wondering if you can talk a little bit about the investments in Q4, just in terms of Next-gen, Wisely, marketing and advertising, just how much incremental spend will there be and are you seeing signs with regards to Wisely, that the interest is picking up and therefore, that's a great place to invest?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I don't feel like it's appropriate to give you, I think you asked for the numbers, I don't know that how -- I think you can probably do the math yourself, like in terms of, when you look at the trajectory that we're on, you could probably back in into some rough this is not in the hundreds of millions of dollars again. But again I respect the short-term orientation that we have here in that you guys are trying to. But I would not read as much as you may be reading into these fourth quarter investors, as we've done this in all the way back to my, Gary taught me everything I know and you Gary, I think as well Mark. And we are a long-term oriented company. And we -- when we see opportunities to improve and to invest in things that are either going to drive our bookings or drive our client satisfaction or drive our efficiency, that's what we are going to do it. We've been doing that all along. So this is, it's not like we hadn't invested, we've been telling you that we've been investing for the last three quarters. And that was a conscious decision, we took a little bit of a bidding for that at the beginning of the year. Fortunately, we had positive surprises on the revenue side and on pays per control and other things, but we committed that we were going to invest through the downturn and that's what we've -- that's what we've done. And now, we feel like there are few things that we can do that I would call -- I don't want to call them housekeeping items -- But they're not -- These are not in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but they put some pressure on our fourth quarter margin. And we knew that it would create some questions even though, it really has nothing to do with 22 or kind of our future expectations of either revenue growth or operating leverage, but I guess I understand the question, but I don't think that maybe Danyal can give you a little bit more color, but I am not sure we giving you an exact number is probably the right approach.\nKathleen Winters: I mean you could -- Yes, I mean -- Sorry, Danyal, I would just I think about it as kind of these are tweaks to the amounts we're spending in Q4 versus kind of wholesale changes to the program here. So it's somewhat modest and what Carlos said it's not in the hundreds the millions of dollars here.\nMark Marcon: I appreciate it.\nDanyal Hussain:  your wisely question, Mark. The one thing we did see was stimulus drove some uptick in the card spent per card. Other than that, during the pandemic, there hasn't been any real notable changes in the Wisely growth trends. So really it's the per card economics that have seen a slight to tick up recently.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes. And I think it's something that we've been excited about. But again, it was hard to get excited about, there was a lot of natural tailwind because people wanted more digitally oriented payment methods in the last three quarters, but from a focus standpoint like for the first couple of quarters of the year, we were focused on a lot of things, and this may not have made it all the way to the top of the list, but it was on a top of the list kind of pre-pandemic, if you recall, and so I think, I would see this is more of a re-emergence of some of the themes and some of the things that we had been talking about that excite us because I think the opportunity is a big ones, I'm glad that the team brought this forward in terms of as an investment opportunity because we were excited about it, call it 12 to 18 months ago, we should just as excited about it today. But admittedly, it wasn't our number one focus, and in the middle of the pandemic, if you will, at the beginning of the pandemic.\nKathleen Winters: Yes. And then just one last comment is we always look very hard at the timing and amount that we spend on marketing and advertising but with economic activity continuing to have momentum and pick up and client engagement picking up, we felt this was the right time to increase that a little bit as well.\nMark Marcon: I really appreciate that color. And it is completely consistent with the long-term track record. Going back to Art. Even before, Gary, can you talk a little bit about this Danyal or can you just remind us what the sensitivity on the pays per control to revenue is?\nDanyal Hussain: It's 25 basis points of revenue impact for every 1 percentage point change in pays per control.\nMark Marcon: I appreciate that. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks. Hey, Carlos, I think you alluded to kind of a record high on account none of us have sense about. Can you give us a sense of where that splits across enterprise mid-down market and how that sits relative to historical trends in the business?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, I can give you some -- I'll give you some color. We don't -- I don't think that's something that we've disclosed in terms of the actual breakdown by business, but I can give you a general ideas. So we had that 6% growth, the 900,000, and we had call it growth of somewhere around that for RUN, our WSN growth was around that as well. And global view was around that as well. So from a client -- pure client growth standpoint if you look at our strategic platforms, they kind of grew in the kind of that neighborhood from a client growth standpoint, which we see as really great news given the very difficult environment that we're in. Obviously, when you look at the mathematically, the overall growth rate and the overall number It's driven in large part by our small business division, because that's where we have the bulk of the absolute number of clients. But I wanted to give you a little bit of color around, if you look at WF, if you look at Workforce Now, across our multiple channels, just remember we start Workforce Now, just in the -- not just in the mid-market but we saw it in the upmarket, and we saw it in the PEO. The PEO platform as well, we also have that platform in Canada. And so that gives you some sense of Canada how well that platform is growing, which is really satisfying to us. So hopefully that helps a little bit.\nKevin McVeigh: Now, that's helpful. And then just on the retention, real quick, I think you took it up from the 125 basis points, up from 100 basis points. Can you just refine that a little bit, is that kind of the Q4 run rate or is that the full year number of this at being fourth quarter is even higher than that? Or is that infinite? The EPM number, and then just any thoughts you could just may be frame on a little bit more .\nCarlos Rodriguez: You've stumped us.\nDanyal Hussain: I think, we said in the opening remarks that it's on the Q3 performance being stronger than expected.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, I think it's generally it's been consistent like it's really frankly remarkable, which is why we keep emphasizing some caution because we hope there is no plan, we're not going to give it back and we're not hoping for give back. But in this business like people who've been following us for a long time, like when we have a 10 basis points to 20 basis point move in retention. It's a big deal. So to have this kind of retention on top of the retention that we had last year is pretty remarkable. And so we're pretty excited about it and I think the key for us is trying to determine like when I look at the retention figures, there is a lot of improvement in what's called the controllable losses. So the ones that are related to kind of service issues and so forth. So we're excited that we might be able to hold on to some of this gain, but at the same time, we're realistic enough to acknowledge that some of the stuff that was related to pan out of business and government stimulus there might be a little bit of give back there, but it's been pretty consistent like every -- It seems like every quarter, the improvement has been in that same neighborhood year-over-year, hence why we kind of tweak the full year because we're probably going to end up in the range that we gave you, which is a little higher than we had before, but it wasn't, we were trying to like send any kind of message about the fourth quarter in particular.\nKevin McVeigh: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thanks so much. I think a lot of good questions already. Just thinking about the retention feels like it's industry wide to some degree. So just trying to better understand your new sales, the reacceleration is it driven more from upselling, and in new business formation, and any surprises in the net switching over the balance of trade from a head-to-head standpoint?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I don't have a lot to report on. We obviously watch all that stuff where you referring to the balance of trade. And as you said, it's hard for me to tell about retention in terms of the rest of the industry you guys would be the experts on that because my casual review of some 10-Ks makes it kind of hard to compare like some people would say retention of their annual recurring revenue cloud revenues, which is not the same as the retention for their company. So it's kind of hard for me to say, I mean, some of it I would say it's probably more variable than you think, based on what I'm seeing in terms of variability of growth rates, because it's clearly been a huge part of our ability to outperform. I mean this is a pretty remarkable revenue performance given what we've been through. And given the pays per control headcount and by the way, what we brought up yet, but we have a huge headwind on client funds interest, which is going to abate here in the fourth quarter and is going to abate next year as well. There may still be a little bit of headwind, but this was really the worst quarter that we had, and these nine months were bad and was $130 million drag just from client funds interest. So when you put everything into the pot, without really good strong retention, it's hard to outperform the way we have and we've done some work on the relative performances of us versus some of our competitors and we feel pretty good about that and about our -- to the potential for retention to be one of the needle movers there, making some other factors that I'm not, we're not, we haven't thought about, but no, I don't think there's anything else really big out there like we've done a little bit better against some of our -- the usual competitors that you know about, in terms of balance of trade but there's others that are still challenging for us. And so, net-net we're pretty comfortable with where we are and determined to continue to drive our growth. I think all of us are probably benefiting from overall economic growth. And the fact that it seems like maybe there are some either in-house or regional providers that are because you can see our, we're growing our units. In Workforce Now, and in RUN. And so, we're -- it seems like we're all have some ability to grow in this environment, which is I guess good for everyone.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yeah, I'm glad you said all that, we shouldn't take it for granted. Just quickly on client satisfaction, notably higher would you attribute it Carlos more to the -- of course support efforts you guys have invested in, but the Next-gen platforms and some of the digital initiatives or are you also seeing just clients maybe building it more better goodwill with ADP spending more time with them during these tough times during the pandemic, just trying to understand, because it seems like it could be -- if it carries over we could see some compounding in the retention?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, I think it's a great question. And I -- we obviously we're trying to figure that out because it's very important to the long-term value creation of the company. And it's all the things you mentioned are you obviously know the business well enough that you hit on all the question is how much is each of those rates, like the last one that you mentioned about the goodwill, there is no question that of being there like there were two or three months where people could not talk to anyone other than us about what to do. Right? What to do about the PPP loans that the government was offering around tax credits, because if you buy software from someone, you can't call to ask them those questions, I just want to remind everyone, right, you can call them that we're about the software and you can send in a ticket to get your software issue resolved, but you can't call to ask about tax deferrals or tax credits or PPP reports or any of that kind of stuff. So we clearly built a lot of goodwill. But on the other hand business is business. And goodwill, it doesn't last forever, so we're not, planning a living off of that for the next five or 10 years. So that brings me back to kind of the basics of client satisfaction, which is we have to be there for our clients when they need us not just during the pandemic, but at all times. So I would say that the second major factor besides the goodwill that I mentioned and some of the digital initiatives to like making easier for our clients and improve our user experience is that we did not panic at the onset of the pandemic. And if you recall, we took some lumps for that because we really maintained our investments both not just in R&D, we maintained our investments in headcount and an implementation. That doesn't mean that we didn't have some drift down as a result of some turnover, which we did and our head count did decline because we had a temporarily a drop in volume, if you will, but that was really, really important right, to be able to kind of get through this period and be able to deliver on our commitments to our, clients and back to the comments I made about productivity before, that's one of those things that we watch very carefully because we want to improve productivity but we weren't -- we can't be naive and think that if our obviously if our headcount was 10% lower, we have higher net income, the problem is, what would your client satisfaction be and your retention. And so that's the magic right of being able to figure out what's that right balance and you have tools to figure that out, you have monitoring systems right to understand what the client satisfaction levels are in relation to how quickly you're getting back to people to resolve their problems for example and how well trained your people are. So there's a number of different factors that we look at, but the key is to be committed to delivering high levels of client service, which we are and I think we just proved it. If we can do it during the pandemic, we can do it anytime.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes. Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. Thanks. I just wanted to start with the bookings question just to make sure you've got the expectations right here, just trying to do the math on the Q4 implied guide. I think it would be about 90% growth. So I wanted to see if that's accurate, obviously you've got the super easy comp there and maybe as part of that can you just talk about some of the activity you've seen through the first month of the quarter. I mean I assume you've got pretty high visibility here, just given that you raised the low end of the full-year guidance range for the bookings?\nDanyal Hussain: Hey, Jason. It's Danyal. You don't have the weightings by quarter. But what's implied for the fourth quarter is over a 100% bookings growth. And for example, we're tracking right in line with expectations.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, I would say that you should not read anything into that other than what we said, which is, we're still really positive. We believe we're going to continue to get sequential productivity improvements, but the percentage growth rate is really related to the base effects, really when you get down to whether it's 110 or . Not that, I know, you know, it's not that for. I think you're trying to get a number you using the percentage we get to the number. But, yes, yes, you should probably -- if I were you, I would look at maybe call it the second quarter or maybe 2019 fourth quarter or something has got to be something else that would give you something good as a proxy, right? Where we don't expect to be back at 100% productivity levels in the fourth quarter, but we should be getting close to like where we were in 2019, and there may be other small moving parts there from 2019. So I don't want to go out on a limb and say that's the right analog but anyway, I think that's hopefully helpful.\nJason Kupferberg: Yes. So it is -- your comp certainly would matter more. I just wanted to make sure people kind have the right numbers in their models for the quarter. And then just a quick follow-up on the pays per control, I think you mentioned it was a little worse than you anticipated in Q3 and you tempered your Q4 expectations a little bit. I'm just curious, which part of the portfolio is driving that? It just things maybe a little incongruous with the US employment data that we're seeing at a high level, which obviously has continued to outperform expectations?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, it's a 100% timing related because we can see in the data, we have other datasets like to show us, like for example, job postings and background checks, screenings and so forth. And so, you shouldn't read anything into it and we did not temper our fourth quarter at all, and in fact we kind of try to clarify that we kept the full year, the same despite the third quarter being a little bit softer in part because we think we're on the same positive trajectory that I think that we thought we were on. So we're seeing the same thing you're seeing in terms of employment and unemployment, and we would fully expect these pays per control numbers to improve rapidly here. And remember that we're talking today about numbers that were through the end of the third -- Sorry through the end of March and those numbers are for three months. Correct? So if you look at the third month in March is different than it was for January. And January, February, I know it's hard to remember to think back that far and how bad things were, that was a completely different picture and the picture we had in early April and maybe in the last, very last week of March. So I wouldn't, I wouldn't read anything into it other than timing.\nKathleen Winters: Yes. And you know just to clarity -- I were just to clarify, was just a slight tweak to the Q4 number and holding the full year at down 3% to 4%. So it's really kind of very minor tweaks.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay, perfect. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Pete Christiansen from Citi. Your line is open.\nPete Christiansen: Good morning, thanks for the question, Carlos. I think the high customer sat scores, the goodwill truly a testament to ADP's capabilities and certainly the service -- the service business model. But I guess clients' needs certainly change and we've been hearing from some of our other companies that talent acquisition has been I guess even more challenging than in the past and I recall at the last Analyst Day that ADP had really been making a lot of strides in improving its recruiting management tools so on and so forth. How would you, think that you, stack up competitively in that area, particularly in recruiting management tools and do you think that could be in another vehicle or vessel to maintain the high retention levels that you're currently experiencing?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Absolutely. I think that you're right, I mean, some of this obviously is cyclical, right in the sense that 12 to 18 months ago people were looking for other tools, other than client acquisition tools. So you have to be careful about not kind of shifting with the necessarily to be consistently able to help people throughout the whole lifecycle of HCM and right now that happens to be an important one. And so I would say that there's two things, one is we build our own tools, as you said around recruitment management and we also have an RPO business, and we have other tools to help with the talent acquisition process. We also partner and we have some really strong partnerships. I'm not sure -- if I mentioned the names of the companies are not but the names that you hear a lot of kind of advertising about, we have a very strong integration and partnerships with some of those companies to really make it easy, in particular in small business, but also even in the mid-market for people to use those tools to really help with the recruiting needs that they that they have, but we feel we've been making, we have made significant investments in our recruitment management platform and our talent acquisition platforms, nothing to do with the pandemic, so that you could call it for tools, that we had done that before the pandemic, and we would expect that those would be contributors to our overall value proposition into our revenue -- Sorry, into our bookings growth because those are generally tools that create incrementality around your bookings number. In other words, what you can charge clients is typically there is a core set of solutions and then recruitment management, things like time and attendance will workforce management, those tend to be more incremental around the basic package, if you will, of HCM. So we're positive, we're bullish on it and I think we're very, just as a reminder, our app marketplace is creates a very easy and seamless way for people to use different solutions in HCM and this would be a category that we would have a lot of partners in that market app -- in that app marketplace that allow you to get all the other benefits, you mentioned about ADP's business model and still be able to fulfill your talent acquisition needs, if you don't believe that ADP has what you need, which we believe you do, but if you don't, you can always get it through one of our partners.\nPete Christiansen: That's helpful. And apologies if this was addressed earlier, but given the change in the yield curve, has there been any thoughts on potentially extending duration of the portfolio or any other investment selection choices as you head into '22?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Probably not worth mentioning. The -- as you know in the yield curve, like right now kind of 5 and 7-year is a little bit better than two and three just because of the way the Fed is managing the curve, if you will. So I think there are always, I'll call them tactical opportunities. But no, I mean I think our duration has been in the same range since I've been CEO, and I would anticipate that not changing and we're not changing laddering strategy and we're not changing our client funds interest strategies. The good news is that it appears the worst is behind us in terms of drag from client funds interest which was painful. I think we had a $50 million drag just this quarter. So, again, not to beat a dead horse, but it just shows the strength of the business that we didn't mention that to you. And if we kind of overcame that drag $130 million for the year. So we're looking forward to better times ahead, and I did see an interesting chart. Again, I probably shouldn't say this, but we had $16 billion in balances in 2008 and we had $635 million in client funds interest. I'm sorry, $685 million not $635 million, in client funds interest. So just shows to you the magnitude, I mean, you all know what's happened to interest rates, but that was 2008, that wasn't like in a different century or in a different country like that was here, and so today, our balances are call it the mid $20 billion number for the year and that's the expectation, so I think you could probably do the math yourself in terms of, if we do believe that there's going to be some inflation here and if you look at the inflation breakevens and you look at some other things that are going on, We're looking forward to better times ahead for client funds interest.\nPete Christiansen: And the adjusted EBITDA margin was 19% back then. You're already above that, that's great, thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have time for one more question that comes from Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nJeff Silber: My questions have already been asked.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes our question and answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for any closing remarks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: So as you can tell from our comments, we continue to, I think, have the same level of optimism, as we had last quarter and we're really, really thankful for the performance of our sales organization and also our frontline associates in terms of what they've been able to do for our clients and at the risk of ending on a negative note though, all of this positive, and all of this positivity and enthusiasm, we don't want to overlook the fact that we still have some challenges and some people still have some challenges in other parts of the world. This is a US headquartered company with over 80% of our revenues in the US. So that's probably why you're hearing all of this optimism, but we're not only in the US, we have associates in India, in Brazil, in Canada, and in Europe. And the situation is not the same there. Even though the businesses are performing well, we just as back in the spring of last year, it was enormous suffering and challenges here in the US among our associates, the same thing is happening for some of our associates in some other parts of the world, in particular in India. And we are not going to forget them, we're doing everything we can to help them. We appreciate what the US government is doing along with the Indian government and local governments to help as well. And we look forward to have helping them kind of get through the same difficult situation that we managed to get through and they too will have their vaccination rates pickup in all of those parts of the world and they too will emerge from the pandemic. But it's clear that it's going to take a little bit longer and we should all remember to be there to help them and support them in any way we can, and I think people will do exactly that. But, having said that, we are --close to seeing the situation in the rearview mirror here and we're really anxious to see our growth rates, we accelerate to kind of where we were pre-pandemic here at some point in the future and getting back to the business and to helping our clients with their challenges and helping our associates build careers and helping all of you and our other shareholders and stakeholders get a fair, a fair return for their investment. So again, as always, we appreciate your interest in ADP and we appreciate you tuning in and we will be back in a quarter with our outlook for fiscal year '22. Thank you!\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Kathleen Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Carlos, and good morning everyone. Q3 represented another strong quarter for us with our performance on both revenues and margins driven by excellent execution across the organization. Our revenues grew 1% on both a reported and organic constant currency basis, which represented a slight acceleration versus Q2. We delivered this growth despite incremental drag from client funds interest versus Q2, as well as some incremental pressure related to our usual seasonal Q3 revenue drivers such as annual W-2 Form. I'll share more on these in a moment. As anticipated, we also experienced a margin decline as we continued to make additional growth in productivity investments and as we experienced a more significant client funds interest revenue decline compared to prior quarters, but the 90 basis points of margin decline was better than our expectations. Combining this revenue and margin performance, our adjusted EBIT was down 2% to $1.1 billion. Our adjusted effective tax rate increased slightly compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020, as we had less contribution from excess tax benefit on stock comp, but our share count was lower year-over-year driven by share repurchases, and as a result, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.89 was down a modest 2% versus last year. For our Employer Services segment, revenues declined 1% on a reported basis and 2% on an organic constant currency basis, demonstrating steady growth rates compared to last quarter, despite additional pressure from two sources as I just mentioned, both of which were fully anticipated. First, with greater pressure from client funds interest, our Q3 has a seasonally larger client funds balance than other quarters of the year and as a result, it skews more to cash and cash equivalent investments where interest rates have been pushed down to near zero. As a result, our client funds interest declined 32% versus last year with average yield down 70 basis points, more than offsetting our strong balance growth, which improved to 6%. Second with the headwind related to seasonal Q3 revenues like the annual Form W-2 which effectively makes our Q3 slightly more sensitive to pays per control and employment turnover trends and other quarters. Looking past these two headwinds, underlying ES performance showed sequential improvement driven in part by continued record level retention that was partially offset by slightly lower than expected pays per control. Employer Services Q3 margin was down 120 basis points compared to last year ahead of our expectations. We continue to invest in headcount to support our growing client base. We also started lapping lower incentive costs from last year and we experienced greater pressure from the lower client funds interest revenue compared to the first half of this year. But at the same time we kept our focus on prudent cost control and continue to execute on our transformation initiatives. And that's exactly right. And I'll just add in, in addition to what I think is smartly doing those investments in the fourth quarter and accelerating some of that, we've also got some year-over-year comp things going on right? As you would expect with selling having been down Q4 last year versus Q4 this year, we'd see incremental year-over-year selling expense in Q4 as well. I mean you could -- Yes, I mean -- Sorry, Danyal, I would just I think about it as kind of these are tweaks to the amounts we're spending in Q4 versus kind of wholesale changes to the program here. So it's somewhat modest and what Carlos said it's not in the hundreds the millions of dollars here. Yes. And then just one last comment is we always look very hard at the timing and amount that we spend on marketing and advertising but with economic activity continuing to have momentum and pick up and client engagement picking up, we felt this was the right time to increase that a little bit as well. Yes. And you know just to clarity -- I were just to clarify, was just a slight tweak to the Q4 number and holding the full year at down 3% to 4%. So it's really kind of very minor tweaks."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Carlos Rodriguez",
            "content": "Thank you, Danny. And thank you everyone for joining our call. This morning, we reported another strong set of quarterly results that were ahead of our expectations. With revenue growth of 1% and adjusted EBIT margin down 90 basis points, combining for a modest adjusted diluted EPS decline of 2%. This of course was the final quarter, before we begin to lap the impact of the pandemic, and I'm very proud of our organization's ability to have delivered positive revenue and earnings growth for the first nine months of the fiscal year despite unprecedented challenges in the economy and the labor markets. I'll start with a review of some of our key performance drivers and an update on the operating environment, we've been experiencing. This quarter, our Employer Services New Business Bookings reaccelerated and we delivered 7% growth, a strong result for the team. The improved year-over-year growth compared to the second quarter was driven by every business unit. Importantly, we ended the quarter on a particularly strong note with record March sales performance that was well above pre-pandemic fiscal 2019 levels, which we see as a positive signal for client engagement in the quarters ahead. The selling environment will likely continue to evolve, month-to-month, and with differences on a regional basis as COVID cases and the reopening trajectories stabilize. We are optimistic that with vaccine deployment progressing steadily, our clients are in the best position since the pandemic started to begin making buying decisions again. Yes, I think that's right. I think you would look at it really as incremental, because if you recall, like our first quarter, we had pretty robust sales results really with almost 100% of our sales force working virtually at that at that point. So we expect that the increased activity, if you listen to the tone of our comments that it's really incremental and hopefully gets us quickly back to the same productivity levels we were pre-pandemic, which we were approaching in the third and fourth quarter here, and then hopefully beyond that, because obviously part of our model before was that we expected some incremental improvement in productivity each year, in addition to increases in headcount and when you have combine those factors in addition to kind of new products and other things, that's what kind of drove our new business bookings growth, the combination of increases in headcount, and increases in productivity. So you're right, that's the path is this will help us get quickly back to our previous productivity and hopefully allow us to get above that, which is I think, important for us in terms of our long-term growth expectations. I think for corporate, I think, if you're referring to really was clearly on the team, we've -- there's a lot of discussion about a lot of different things, including an increase in the kind of tax rate for the higher income individuals. But right now from -- And there's obviously discussion about capital gains taxes as well. But right now the thing that is probably most prevalent in discussions is corporate income tax rate, and I'm trying to think through I don't believe that there has really any direct impact on our balances obviously have an impact on ADP corporate itself, but I don't think that you have. Well, I think if you -- from our prepared comments, you'd probably see that the pressures are what I would call self-inflicted in the sense that we believe is an opportunity for us to make some investments that improve our long-term growth prospects, both for '22 and beyond. And I think Kathleen particularly mentioned the two or three things that we're investing. And so the answer is no, there's no kind of mysterious margin pressure. In other words, the business continues to move in the right trajectory like almost every metric we have has improved in fact I say every metric we have has improved sequentially, even the pays per control, even though it was modest, it's still rounded to 6% down. We know now after watching the data at the beginning of Q4 that that's heading in the right direction and we can all tell from what's happening with unemployment but that-- that's going to also continue to improve fairly quickly here. So when you really kind of add it all together, like we're in a very strong position have very strong momentum and people who have known us for a long time, know that when we experience that we try to reinvest some of that and I think that's exactly what you're seeing in the fourth quarter. So I would say that those are conscious decisions that we are making. It's a relatively modest contribution because despite our level of excitement about really all of our Next-Gen platforms and even Roll, which you could argue that that's a NextGen solution as well. Again it's just because of the size and scale of our company like right now from a dollar impact standpoint, it's really not, that's not what's moving the needle really across the board, really in every business unit in every channel and every category, our bookings have been improving again sequentially every quarter and they continue to do that this quarter. So we believe that medium to long term, that's the key to us, sustaining kind of our multi-decade growth rates is these Next-gen platforms, but I just continue to caution everyone to because we want to give you the updates and we want to continue to focus on next-gen and I like, I appreciate the question important to kind of separate what's driving the quarters and what's driving the next fiscal year versus what's driving the next three to five years. And I would say that Next-gen payroll is going to be increasingly important in the next year or two from a bookings standpoint and we'll start to probably make a difference and will then give you that color in terms of what difference its making, but we should be cautious about revenue impact, just because of the recurring revenue model just takes a while for that to get into the revenue growth numbers, but it was positive, but really not. Now, we're really moved the needle. That come is really the message there. Well, I mean I think there is a number of moving parts. And I think it probably depends on people's current business model. So, as you know, our business model is really more about providing not just a software-based to support right support you call service, you can call it compliance, and I think what we saw this year with all of the activity that the government had around the various stimulus programs to help companies and individuals and so we're that created a lot of complexity for employers, it appears that we're entering into an environment where despite the pandemic hopefully fading, there will be increased levels of government activity around employment and incentives and that kind of that kind of thing. I think that's a good environment for ADP and for our down market business because most small businesses, don't have the time or the inclination to really focus on these things and to take care of these things. So it works for some clients and we believe that that's why we're rolling out Roll, no pun intended, but once you get to even a little bit slightly larger you do end up running into issues that you need help with and you need support and you need advice and much of that can be automated, but you still need it. So for example, a lot of our PPP support reports were automated. So it doesn't mean that somebody has to get on the phone and have a discussion about your PPP report, but you have to be focused on providing the support and the compliance in addition to just the software. So I think that helped us this year and again, so to answer your question, how do we believe we're set up competitively right now? I think we're set up excellently, competitively, because we now have very simple solutions for the micro-market where people want to self-buy, self-install, and don't have complexity and maybe don't have issues with taxes or compliance or don't want to ask questions, because it's not priced or built to ask questions. But we also have the ability to provide this assistance that is important for even small clients for sure it's important for mid-sized clients and for larger clients, but I think what really got highlighted this year is that small clients need a lot of help and need a lot of assistance and you can see it in our growth rates in our retention in our client satisfaction, like in all of our metrics in our small business division that we happen to be in the right place at the right time I think to be able to help our clients and then hopefully no benefit from the tailwind of the demand that that's going to create on a go-forward basis. So anyway long-winded way of saying, I think we're in a great position, because of our business model. I don't feel like it's appropriate to give you, I think you asked for the numbers, I don't know that how -- I think you can probably do the math yourself, like in terms of, when you look at the trajectory that we're on, you could probably back in into some rough this is not in the hundreds of millions of dollars again. But again I respect the short-term orientation that we have here in that you guys are trying to. But I would not read as much as you may be reading into these fourth quarter investors, as we've done this in all the way back to my, Gary taught me everything I know and you Gary, I think as well Mark. And we are a long-term oriented company. And we -- when we see opportunities to improve and to invest in things that are either going to drive our bookings or drive our client satisfaction or drive our efficiency, that's what we are going to do it. We've been doing that all along. So this is, it's not like we hadn't invested, we've been telling you that we've been investing for the last three quarters. And that was a conscious decision, we took a little bit of a bidding for that at the beginning of the year. Fortunately, we had positive surprises on the revenue side and on pays per control and other things, but we committed that we were going to invest through the downturn and that's what we've -- that's what we've done. And now, we feel like there are few things that we can do that I would call -- I don't want to call them housekeeping items -- But they're not -- These are not in the hundreds of millions of dollars, but they put some pressure on our fourth quarter margin. And we knew that it would create some questions even though, it really has nothing to do with 22 or kind of our future expectations of either revenue growth or operating leverage, but I guess I understand the question, but I don't think that maybe Danyal can give you a little bit more color, but I am not sure we giving you an exact number is probably the right approach. Yes. And I think it's something that we've been excited about. But again, it was hard to get excited about, there was a lot of natural tailwind because people wanted more digitally oriented payment methods in the last three quarters, but from a focus standpoint like for the first couple of quarters of the year, we were focused on a lot of things, and this may not have made it all the way to the top of the list, but it was on a top of the list kind of pre-pandemic, if you recall, and so I think, I would see this is more of a re-emergence of some of the themes and some of the things that we had been talking about that excite us because I think the opportunity is a big ones, I'm glad that the team brought this forward in terms of as an investment opportunity because we were excited about it, call it 12 to 18 months ago, we should just as excited about it today. But admittedly, it wasn't our number one focus, and in the middle of the pandemic, if you will, at the beginning of the pandemic. Yes, I can give you some -- I'll give you some color. We don't -- I don't think that's something that we've disclosed in terms of the actual breakdown by business, but I can give you a general ideas. So we had that 6% growth, the 900,000, and we had call it growth of somewhere around that for RUN, our WSN growth was around that as well. And global view was around that as well. So from a client -- pure client growth standpoint if you look at our strategic platforms, they kind of grew in the kind of that neighborhood from a client growth standpoint, which we see as really great news given the very difficult environment that we're in. Obviously, when you look at the mathematically, the overall growth rate and the overall number It's driven in large part by our small business division, because that's where we have the bulk of the absolute number of clients. But I wanted to give you a little bit of color around, if you look at WF, if you look at Workforce Now, across our multiple channels, just remember we start Workforce Now, just in the -- not just in the mid-market but we saw it in the upmarket, and we saw it in the PEO. The PEO platform as well, we also have that platform in Canada. And so that gives you some sense of Canada how well that platform is growing, which is really satisfying to us. So hopefully that helps a little bit. You've stumped us. Yes, I think it's generally it's been consistent like it's really frankly remarkable, which is why we keep emphasizing some caution because we hope there is no plan, we're not going to give it back and we're not hoping for give back. But in this business like people who've been following us for a long time, like when we have a 10 basis points to 20 basis point move in retention. It's a big deal. So to have this kind of retention on top of the retention that we had last year is pretty remarkable. And so we're pretty excited about it and I think the key for us is trying to determine like when I look at the retention figures, there is a lot of improvement in what's called the controllable losses. So the ones that are related to kind of service issues and so forth. So we're excited that we might be able to hold on to some of this gain, but at the same time, we're realistic enough to acknowledge that some of the stuff that was related to pan out of business and government stimulus there might be a little bit of give back there, but it's been pretty consistent like every -- It seems like every quarter, the improvement has been in that same neighborhood year-over-year, hence why we kind of tweak the full year because we're probably going to end up in the range that we gave you, which is a little higher than we had before, but it wasn't, we were trying to like send any kind of message about the fourth quarter in particular. I don't have a lot to report on. We obviously watch all that stuff where you referring to the balance of trade. And as you said, it's hard for me to tell about retention in terms of the rest of the industry you guys would be the experts on that because my casual review of some 10-Ks makes it kind of hard to compare like some people would say retention of their annual recurring revenue cloud revenues, which is not the same as the retention for their company. So it's kind of hard for me to say, I mean, some of it I would say it's probably more variable than you think, based on what I'm seeing in terms of variability of growth rates, because it's clearly been a huge part of our ability to outperform. I mean this is a pretty remarkable revenue performance given what we've been through. And given the pays per control headcount and by the way, what we brought up yet, but we have a huge headwind on client funds interest, which is going to abate here in the fourth quarter and is going to abate next year as well. There may still be a little bit of headwind, but this was really the worst quarter that we had, and these nine months were bad and was $130 million drag just from client funds interest. So when you put everything into the pot, without really good strong retention, it's hard to outperform the way we have and we've done some work on the relative performances of us versus some of our competitors and we feel pretty good about that and about our -- to the potential for retention to be one of the needle movers there, making some other factors that I'm not, we're not, we haven't thought about, but no, I don't think there's anything else really big out there like we've done a little bit better against some of our -- the usual competitors that you know about, in terms of balance of trade but there's others that are still challenging for us. And so, net-net we're pretty comfortable with where we are and determined to continue to drive our growth. I think all of us are probably benefiting from overall economic growth. And the fact that it seems like maybe there are some either in-house or regional providers that are because you can see our, we're growing our units. In Workforce Now, and in RUN. And so, we're -- it seems like we're all have some ability to grow in this environment, which is I guess good for everyone. Yes, I think it's a great question. And I -- we obviously we're trying to figure that out because it's very important to the long-term value creation of the company. And it's all the things you mentioned are you obviously know the business well enough that you hit on all the question is how much is each of those rates, like the last one that you mentioned about the goodwill, there is no question that of being there like there were two or three months where people could not talk to anyone other than us about what to do. Right? What to do about the PPP loans that the government was offering around tax credits, because if you buy software from someone, you can't call to ask them those questions, I just want to remind everyone, right, you can call them that we're about the software and you can send in a ticket to get your software issue resolved, but you can't call to ask about tax deferrals or tax credits or PPP reports or any of that kind of stuff. So we clearly built a lot of goodwill. But on the other hand business is business. And goodwill, it doesn't last forever, so we're not, planning a living off of that for the next five or 10 years. So that brings me back to kind of the basics of client satisfaction, which is we have to be there for our clients when they need us not just during the pandemic, but at all times. So I would say that the second major factor besides the goodwill that I mentioned and some of the digital initiatives to like making easier for our clients and improve our user experience is that we did not panic at the onset of the pandemic. And if you recall, we took some lumps for that because we really maintained our investments both not just in R&D, we maintained our investments in headcount and an implementation. That doesn't mean that we didn't have some drift down as a result of some turnover, which we did and our head count did decline because we had a temporarily a drop in volume, if you will, but that was really, really important right, to be able to kind of get through this period and be able to deliver on our commitments to our, clients and back to the comments I made about productivity before, that's one of those things that we watch very carefully because we want to improve productivity but we weren't -- we can't be naive and think that if our obviously if our headcount was 10% lower, we have higher net income, the problem is, what would your client satisfaction be and your retention. And so that's the magic right of being able to figure out what's that right balance and you have tools to figure that out, you have monitoring systems right to understand what the client satisfaction levels are in relation to how quickly you're getting back to people to resolve their problems for example and how well trained your people are. So there's a number of different factors that we look at, but the key is to be committed to delivering high levels of client service, which we are and I think we just proved it. If we can do it during the pandemic, we can do it anytime. Yes, I would say that you should not read anything into that other than what we said, which is, we're still really positive. We believe we're going to continue to get sequential productivity improvements, but the percentage growth rate is really related to the base effects, really when you get down to whether it's 110 or . Not that, I know, you know, it's not that for. I think you're trying to get a number you using the percentage we get to the number. But, yes, yes, you should probably -- if I were you, I would look at maybe call it the second quarter or maybe 2019 fourth quarter or something has got to be something else that would give you something good as a proxy, right? Where we don't expect to be back at 100% productivity levels in the fourth quarter, but we should be getting close to like where we were in 2019, and there may be other small moving parts there from 2019. So I don't want to go out on a limb and say that's the right analog but anyway, I think that's hopefully helpful. Yes, it's a 100% timing related because we can see in the data, we have other datasets like to show us, like for example, job postings and background checks, screenings and so forth. And so, you shouldn't read anything into it and we did not temper our fourth quarter at all, and in fact we kind of try to clarify that we kept the full year, the same despite the third quarter being a little bit softer in part because we think we're on the same positive trajectory that I think that we thought we were on. So we're seeing the same thing you're seeing in terms of employment and unemployment, and we would fully expect these pays per control numbers to improve rapidly here. And remember that we're talking today about numbers that were through the end of the third -- Sorry through the end of March and those numbers are for three months. Correct? So if you look at the third month in March is different than it was for January. And January, February, I know it's hard to remember to think back that far and how bad things were, that was a completely different picture and the picture we had in early April and maybe in the last, very last week of March. So I wouldn't, I wouldn't read anything into it other than timing. Absolutely. I think that you're right, I mean, some of this obviously is cyclical, right in the sense that 12 to 18 months ago people were looking for other tools, other than client acquisition tools. So you have to be careful about not kind of shifting with the necessarily to be consistently able to help people throughout the whole lifecycle of HCM and right now that happens to be an important one. And so I would say that there's two things, one is we build our own tools, as you said around recruitment management and we also have an RPO business, and we have other tools to help with the talent acquisition process. We also partner and we have some really strong partnerships. I'm not sure -- if I mentioned the names of the companies are not but the names that you hear a lot of kind of advertising about, we have a very strong integration and partnerships with some of those companies to really make it easy, in particular in small business, but also even in the mid-market for people to use those tools to really help with the recruiting needs that they that they have, but we feel we've been making, we have made significant investments in our recruitment management platform and our talent acquisition platforms, nothing to do with the pandemic, so that you could call it for tools, that we had done that before the pandemic, and we would expect that those would be contributors to our overall value proposition into our revenue -- Sorry, into our bookings growth because those are generally tools that create incrementality around your bookings number. In other words, what you can charge clients is typically there is a core set of solutions and then recruitment management, things like time and attendance will workforce management, those tend to be more incremental around the basic package, if you will, of HCM. So we're positive, we're bullish on it and I think we're very, just as a reminder, our app marketplace is creates a very easy and seamless way for people to use different solutions in HCM and this would be a category that we would have a lot of partners in that market app -- in that app marketplace that allow you to get all the other benefits, you mentioned about ADP's business model and still be able to fulfill your talent acquisition needs, if you don't believe that ADP has what you need, which we believe you do, but if you don't, you can always get it through one of our partners. Probably not worth mentioning. The -- as you know in the yield curve, like right now kind of 5 and 7-year is a little bit better than two and three just because of the way the Fed is managing the curve, if you will. So I think there are always, I'll call them tactical opportunities. But no, I mean I think our duration has been in the same range since I've been CEO, and I would anticipate that not changing and we're not changing laddering strategy and we're not changing our client funds interest strategies. The good news is that it appears the worst is behind us in terms of drag from client funds interest which was painful. I think we had a $50 million drag just this quarter. So, again, not to beat a dead horse, but it just shows the strength of the business that we didn't mention that to you. And if we kind of overcame that drag $130 million for the year. So we're looking forward to better times ahead, and I did see an interesting chart. Again, I probably shouldn't say this, but we had $16 billion in balances in 2008 and we had $635 million in client funds interest. I'm sorry, $685 million not $635 million, in client funds interest. So just shows to you the magnitude, I mean, you all know what's happened to interest rates, but that was 2008, that wasn't like in a different century or in a different country like that was here, and so today, our balances are call it the mid $20 billion number for the year and that's the expectation, so I think you could probably do the math yourself in terms of, if we do believe that there's going to be some inflation here and if you look at the inflation breakevens and you look at some other things that are going on, We're looking forward to better times ahead for client funds interest. So as you can tell from our comments, we continue to, I think, have the same level of optimism, as we had last quarter and we're really, really thankful for the performance of our sales organization and also our frontline associates in terms of what they've been able to do for our clients and at the risk of ending on a negative note though, all of this positive, and all of this positivity and enthusiasm, we don't want to overlook the fact that we still have some challenges and some people still have some challenges in other parts of the world. This is a US headquartered company with over 80% of our revenues in the US. So that's probably why you're hearing all of this optimism, but we're not only in the US, we have associates in India, in Brazil, in Canada, and in Europe. And the situation is not the same there. Even though the businesses are performing well, we just as back in the spring of last year, it was enormous suffering and challenges here in the US among our associates, the same thing is happening for some of our associates in some other parts of the world, in particular in India. And we are not going to forget them, we're doing everything we can to help them. We appreciate what the US government is doing along with the Indian government and local governments to help as well. And we look forward to have helping them kind of get through the same difficult situation that we managed to get through and they too will have their vaccination rates pickup in all of those parts of the world and they too will emerge from the pandemic. But it's clear that it's going to take a little bit longer and we should all remember to be there to help them and support them in any way we can, and I think people will do exactly that. But, having said that, we are --close to seeing the situation in the rearview mirror here and we're really anxious to see our growth rates, we accelerate to kind of where we were pre-pandemic here at some point in the future and getting back to the business and to helping our clients with their challenges and helping our associates build careers and helping all of you and our other shareholders and stakeholders get a fair, a fair return for their investment. So again, as always, we appreciate your interest in ADP and we appreciate you tuning in and we will be back in a quarter with our outlook for fiscal year '22. Thank you!"

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there'll be a question-and-answer session.  Thank you. I'll now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanyal Hussain: Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining ADP's second quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call and webcast. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you, Danny, and thank you everyone for joining our call. This morning we reported results reflecting our continued strong business performance and momentum, with our second quarter revenue and margins both outperforming our expectations, as our business continued to demonstrate resilience in the face of ongoing economic headwinds. We reported revenue of $3.7 billion, up 1% on a reported basis and flat on an organic constant currency basis, with adjusted EBIT margin down 30 basis points. Coupled with a slight increase in the effective tax rate versus last year, our share count reduction our adjusted diluted EPS was flat versus last year, much better than the decrease we were expecting. During the second quarter, we continue to see signs of improvement in the overall operating environment, with the positive implications for pays per control, new business bookings and retention. Our pays per control metric performed slightly better than expected, as it improved sequentially to a decline of 6% versus the larger declines we experienced in Q1 in the latter part of fiscal 2020. Underlying employment trends in Q2 were consistent with what we experienced in Q1, with larger enterprises somewhat slower to show improvement, but with small and midsize businesses demonstrating a healthy level of hiring. We performed well on employer services new business bookings. Even though bookings declined 7% this quarter, this was well ahead of our initial expectations earlier this year, and in line with the revised expectations we communicated last quarter. And it's important to point out, that our new business bookings for the first half nearly matched last year's half, despite the very difficult environment.\nKathleen Winters: Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter across every major business metric. While we will still see some pandemic related headwinds for the balance of the year, we are more confident in our outlook given we believe the toughest part is behind us. Our performance thus far into the year reaffirms the resilience of our business model, the strength of our product, and the ability of our sales and service teams to perform even in the toughest of environments. We remain confident in our ability to execute as we move forward. In the second quarter, our revenues grew 1% on a reported basis, flat on an organic constant currency basis, which is significantly better than our expectations coming into the year and better than even the revised expectations we had as of last quarter. Once again, ES retention rates represented favorability as did very strong performance from our PEO. We managed expenses prudently, while making important incremental growth and productivity investments and delivered margins that were better than our expectations. Our adjusted EBIT was down just 1% despite pressure from a decline in client funds interest. Our adjusted effective tax rate increased 20 basis points, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Our share count was lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases. And as a result, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.52 was flat versus last year second quarter. Moving on to the segments. For ES, our revenues declined 1% on a reported basis, and 2% on inorganic constant currency basis, representing continued sequential improvements driven by record level retention, and the more modest 6% decline in pays for control versus 9% last quarter. Client funds interest declined 23%, as average yield declined 50 basis points versus last year.\nOperator:  We'll take our first question from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I'll ask two upfront here. So first on bookings, can you talk about composition of bookings in 2Q versus 1Q? And give us a sense if you can dissect the strongest and weakest demand across client size? And then, just looking at the SG&A level this quarter, can you comment on the drivers of the sequential dollar growth there? I heard the comments on accelerated investment. Is that primarily sales force headcount addition or other areas of spend?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Sure, let me take the - I'll take the bookings maybe and I'll let Kathleen talk about the SG&A. On the bookings, and I think some of this is just the lumpiness if you will of the results, because there's no - there are a couple of things that happened but it's hard to call it a trend right, because we only have really two quarters if you will of post-pandemic results. But in essence, our mid-market business performed a lot better. So, workforce now and the mid-market business did much better in this quarter than in the last quarter. And then, if you remember, last quarter we talked about that we got some help from our international business and in particular we called out multinational deals, and that was I'm not sure we gave any color around that, but that was strong double-digits is the way I would put it, last quarter helped the last quarter's growth. And this quarter it was kind of slightly negative. Now in the context of what's happening in Europe, which really started to shut down and started to have challenges before the U.S. in terms of the resurgence of the virus, we're pretty happy with that. Like we're pretty proud of our sales teams over there that they were able to accomplish what they did in the second quarter, but sequentially it was not as strong as the help we got in the first quarter. We also had really strong bookings in the first quarter in our down-market business, we had some, what I would call modest help from some - what we call client conversions or we call client-based acquisitions, which we do on a regular basis, but they don't come in every single quarter, so we got a little bit of help from that. And I think I also mentioned last quarter, I think I've been doing this for nine years mentioning that whenever we have a strong finish to a year, we typically get off to a slower start. And the opposite is also true, when we have a really bad year, we tend to get off to a stronger start. A lot of our business is counted at the time of sale and start, but some of our businesses, as you know, like in the up market, there is some flexibility if you will in the sales force. We don't necessarily endorse that, but there is some flexibility for salespeople to book something in call it July versus in May. And because of the way the incentives work and so forth, sometimes we get a little bit of movement from sales into the next fiscal year, if we have a bad fiscal year and the opposite is also true. We'll have a strong fiscal year. We tend to have a hard time getting started in July. But I think we've been - so this is nothing new. We've been I think transparent, giving you all the kind of the color that we can around bookings. I will tell you that when we cut through all that, so we're trying to look at no different than you would do with for example, earnings, where we trying to see what's the core business doing excluding client funds interest, what's happening with the core business excluding pressure from pays per control. We do the same thing in bookings, like what's happening in the core underlying bookings. And we see very positive momentum there, in terms of lead generation, digital leads coming in activity by the sales force. So we're optimistic that the momentum will continue into the third and fourth quarter. Of course, the caveat being, the virus has to cooperate in terms of and the vaccine rollout has to continue to stay on track. But I think overall, if you cut through all the - it's not fair to call them onetime items, but if you cut through all the noise, our momentum in the second quarter, in terms of bookings was stronger than it was in the first quarter, even though it might not be what the reported number shows. And I'll let Kathleen talk about the SG&A.\nKathleen Winters: Sure. So on the SG&A side, I mean, you do have a lot of things within that SG&A. But I would think about it this way. The overall view or picture is that from a selling standpoint, I'll talk about kind of full year, and then we can talk about linearity. But from an overall standpoint, we continue to invest in sales, as we've mentioned, and that is both headcount investment, as well as continuing to look at marketing investment and doing some of that. So you've got that investment in sales, but you've also got the work we're doing around transformation, which would be offsetting that investment, as well as just discretionary cost control that we're very focused on doing as well. So kind of overall, you've got investment, headcount and marketing, you've got transformation work that we continue to do, and discretionary cost control. That does change if you look at or not change, but the SKU first half the second half is a little bit different, as we do have significant bookings growth in Q4, our expectation, and so of course, that's going to result in higher Q4 selling expense for us.\nBryan Bergin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Good morning. Just want to make sure I understood, the employee service bookings for the quarter came in line with expectations, but you guys did decide to raise the full year. So just want to make sure I understand the pipeline, the visibility there that's causing that raise. And then on retention to record levels. Are you seeing anything in particular on the competition front that is having less of an impact in years past that's driving the higher retention? Thanks so much.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Sure. On a pipeline question, we do have some visibility. But some of this is really about extrapolating momentum, because in the down market, it's really more about headcount and productivity than it is about pipeline or as in the M&C in the up market. I mean, I'm not telling you anything you wouldn't be able to figure out yourself. So we have a fair amount of visibility in some part of our business, but in other parts of our business, we based on our experience about productivity metrics and headcount and so forth, we have confidence, obviously, in the guidance that we're giving and the raise, otherwise we wouldn't be giving it. But, as couple of things that have changed since last quarter, last quarter we had - what we thought was much better results than we had expected, and we thought we had positive momentum and then on top of that, now we have a vaccine rollout. So that was not something that was it was talked about. But this is now a reality. We also had an election that was still in front of us and that's been resolved. We also thought and people speculated there would be more stimulus and now there is, even though there's even more stimulus being debated, just as a reminder, there was a $900 billion stimulus package that was approved. So I think if you look at what we try to do, we try to do a little bit of kind of correlation, regression, whatever you want to call it, between GDP and economic growth and our bookings, because we do believe there is some connection there. Like there's other things like the training of our sales force, the tools they have, the quality of the sales force, the turnover. But GDP is a powerful force and the GDP numbers are looking pretty strong here on a go forward basis, with perhaps the exception by some of our analysts out there of our third quarter, the quarter we're in right now. But if you look at fourth quarter, our fourth quarter or the first half of next fiscal year for us and then the next calendar year after that, I mean, even this full calendar year GDP expectation has been raised, I think, across the board by everyone. So I think it's partly visibility and pipeline and partly our experience that we know, for example, what a reasonable expectation is for productivity per DM per sales rep. We know how many sales reps we have, we know how many new ones we're hiring. We know what we're generating in terms of leads and digital marketing. And I think we put that all together and that comes out to our guidance. And so I think we're confident in it and we're actually very excited and positive that we were able to do that. And we're just glad that things are looking much better than they were last quarter and certainly better than they were looking in March and in April. On the\u2026\nKathleen Winters: Bryan, if I could just interject the only other detail I'd add on all of that data that Carlos mentioned that we do look at an ongoing basis, is that when we look at the leading indicators in terms of the data we have, so appointments, referrals, demos, opportunities created, as you know, our sales team are inputting leads into the system. All of those are trending better going into the second half than they were before going into the year. And so we're feeling really very optimistic, as you can tell from the raised bookings guidance. We're feeling optimistic going into the second half of the year. In particular the digital leads are up significantly. So, again, just wanted to provide that transparency for you.\nCarlos Rodriguez: And then on the on the retention side, I would say there's probably two data points that I would look at. The retention obviously is incredibly strong and it's going to be record retention for the year, assuming we have the guidance that we've just provided. We've never been at these retention levels. And I think there's a number of factors. I mean, I think our product set is much stronger and it's not just the products themselves, but it's our commitment to moving our clients onto our newer platform. So we have a lot more clients on newer platforms today than we had a year ago, two years ago, whether a quarter ago or a year ago, it's just a continuing progression that we've talked about now for many, many years. But we've made a lot of progress and we know that the retention on our new platforms is higher than on some of our older platforms. So that's helping. There's probably some tailwind from this pandemic related, we just can't put our finger on it. The clients are maybe not moving as much. But if you look at each business unit, like, for example, in our down market, the retention in our down market as a result of better product and better execution has been going up for probably six or seven years and is up almost 500 basis points pre pandemic, and that's gone up even more. So the fact that we've had this positive momentum in the down market, it's a similar story and Workforce Now, if not 500 basis points. But in the mid-market, we've also had three years of improving retention pre pandemic. So I think those are signs that there is something happening in terms of our execution and our product. So, execution is part of it as well, we have to deliver I think on the commitments we make to our clients to resolve issues for them, and answer questions and so. So, it's a combination of better service, excellent service and really better products and migrating clients, I think is helping. And then secondly, the other data point that I would point to which is really on the bookings side, a combination of bookings and retention that our balance of trade is improving with several of our major competitors for the first time in a while. I think, it's again, related to this effort that we've made to improve product, continue to deliver great service,  on execution. And I think it's showing up now in some of these balance of trade numbers we're showing some improvement. So, the reason I bring that up is because balance of trade with the combination of what we're bringing in, in terms of from some of our competitors but also what we're losing to those same competitors. That's why we call it balance of trade. So, there's a number of metrics that would tell me that our competitive position is getting better, and then resulting obviously in higher retention and hopefully also growing booking here in the future.\nBryan Keane: Helpful. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Silber of BMO. Your line is open.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much for taking my question. Two-part question, first is on pricing. I believe it was last quarter maybe the quarter before you talked a little bit about some of your competitors offering some pricing concessions declines. I'm just wondering if that's been continuing. And as a follow-up, I'm just wondering if you're seeing any diverging trends by geography, especially in certain areas where we're seeing higher COVID cases? Thanks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: So, let me take the second one first on divergence. Yes, we would see what we would expect to see, because we are, I think, we're big enough that we kind of really escape again the gravitational pull of overall GDP, but also of specific geographic challenges. So, in Southern California for example, we did see some challenges in terms of our bookings in the down market and into the mid-market there. It's still impressive if we were able to sell as much as we did. As a footnote, we sold a lot of the say that we're flat, almost flat for us, it's at least, we're impressed with ourselves that our bookings are flat for the first half of the year versus last year. But there clearly are pockets of challenges. Southern California would be a challenge, the Midwest was and the Central part of the country was incredibly challenged for several months. But we had other places that things were better as a result of maybe more economic activity, or continuing opening regardless of the controversy around that. And then, again, Europe would be a place where I would call out where I think we started to encounter some real headwinds. So, the geographies were up and not just about U.S. it's also global. So, the answer is yes, and that you should assume that we would be impacted by whatever you're seeing in the news. And so, when you have hard lockdowns in very large metropolitan markets, that would affect us but fortunately, we're very diversified geographically and across segments. So, remember, we operate all the way from small to up market to international and so, we obviously we try to find a way to keep follow these things in balance, and have something helping us, when other things maybe working against us. So, we did see some of that volatility as you described. On the price side, so one of the things we did talk about last quarter, we did talk about competitors and what we heard anecdotally about competitor pricing action, but we also said last quarter that we didn't get any help from price last quarter. We did get a little bit of help. It was not significant but all around, I think was around 30 basis points of help, which is about normally what we would be getting and to the revenue growth help from price. And so, I think what tells you this, what we're trying to signal to you there is to tell you that it was appropriate for us to pause for call it, four to five months our normal price increases. By the way, our normal price increases would have been July 1st would have been one of the main times that we do price increases. And remember, our price increases are much more modest than they were five, 10 years ago. But at our scale, it does matter. But we delayed those price increases. It was not appropriate if you do that given the circumstances that we were under. But you fast forward to September, October, we felt that given the additional services that we were providing. So we're providing a number of incremental services at no additional cost to our clients that I believe our competitors are not providing. And so we thought that going back to our normal modest price increases was a reasonable thing to do and we did that. And you can see the impact on retention which has been none. And so that would be I think a good sign for us.\nJeff Silber: All right. That's great to hear. Thanks so much for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pete Christensen of Citi. Your line is open.\nPete Christensen: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Nice trends here. Carlos, given the lifted view on ES bookings and retention, how would you characterize some of the trends you're seeing in the tax rate for additional - add-on modules, those sorts of things? And how should we think about the runway for the next two or three quarters? And how you see that evolving particularly with some of your new R&D developments, new product and all that?\nCarlos Rodriguez: It's a great question, because there's still a lot of room for us there. We're very focused on market share and new unit growth. But we don't mind additional share of wallet and additional tax rate, because that's helpful too. And as you know, our bookings have generally been balanced for many, many years, about half of it coming from new logos, and half of it coming from incremental attach. So we love that business. I happen to be looking at those figures last night and it obviously varies by business unit. But as an example, in the mid-market, we're kind of in the 60% to 70% range, in terms of a tax rate for things like workforce management, which we used to call time and labor management, and benefits administration. And we have things like data cloud and other items that we can attach as well. But I think the best color to put on that is that there's still a lot of room. I mentioned how we are doing well, not just in our new strategic platforms, but we're also doing well on some of our products that we don't always talk about a lot on these calls like retirement services, insurance services where those tax rates are very low in comparison to what I think is the potential for our client base. Because when you have a tightly integrated solution, it really is a much better experience for our clients. So it's good for us, but it's also good for our clients, which is always an important thing. So I guess the color I would put there is we've got really good tax rates on some of the core HCM modules, like workforce management, then admin. So HR payroll, then admin, workforce management, those are kind of the core talent management is a place where we've been seeing growing tax rates, and there's a lot of room still there for people to adopt those solutions. So, we're very optimistic and this is a key strategy for - I think my predecessor before that, which has been great for us that we have a very broad industry. Part of our reason for concentrating on HCM and focusing the company away from some of the other businesses we have like a brokerage business, and dealer services and so forth is this is a growing robust space globally, and there's plenty of room to grow. We definitely want to still focused on  off of market share and logo growth. But there's an enormous opportunity for us in terms of incremental tax rate.\nPete Christensen: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSamad Samana: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe stepping back for a big picture question a little bit in a time machine. But if I think back to the Analyst Day in 2018 and some of the company's key initiatives around the service alignment and taking costs out of the business, and getting to call it mid-20s EBIT margin. I guess aside from the world being very different with what happened with COVID. But I'm curious Carlos if you could just think as far as those initiatives went and getting the margin structure of the business toward that. Would you say that were ex what happened with rates and what COVID? Would we be in that shape today? And I guess, maybe thinking forward, how should we think about the structural margins of this business post recovery? And can it be at those long-term levels that we talked about before? And then I have one follow-up.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes. Let me give you a little bit of color on that, because, again, incidentally, I was doing my homework last night. So I did go back that's something that I actually have fresh on my mind. And then will correct me if I'm wrong. But I think our margin in '18, which you would have seen in that Analyst Day, was 20.7. And we're now, I think, forecasting for fiscal year '21, I'm not sure that we're forecasting it, but I think you can extrapolate based on our guidance. I'll just throw out a number. So call it 22.3, 22.5 somewhere in that range for fiscal year '21. That's with a significant drag from client funds interest, as you mentioned, and some drag from COVID as a result of slower than we would have thought or would have expected revenue growth. So I would say that on the margin side, we would be well ahead of what we talked about at Analyst Day, excluding these items. On the revenue side, clearly, we're not anywhere near that, hence why we had to withdraw that three-year guidance we had provided, because obviously the COVID headwinds with what happened with pays per control and just the economy in general made it very difficult. But again, it feels like this is a transitory event, as we've talked about now for two or three quarters, painful, devastating for many people, for our country, for the economy and for the world. But it is transitory and not an existential threat. And so we expect to get right back on the track that we were on before. And I happen to think that the fact that we're a couple hundred basis points higher in margin, even with everything that's happened than we were in '18, I think tells you something about the structural margin opportunity in the business. But, clearly a very important part of that picture is growth. We need to grow the business long-term, because growth does require investment and so you should be hearing from us as we care about margin and we think there's opportunity in terms of structural margins here going forward, but the most important thing we can do to drive long-term shareholder value here is to also grow the top-line. And we're focused on that.\nDanyal Hussain: Just to clarify, Samad, our formal margin expectation is 22.0% to 22.5%.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thanks, I appreciate. And that's why I asked it. To us, it sounds like the business is healthier adjusting for non-controllable factors. And maybe just as a follow-up on that on the booking in this quarter and just as you think about bookings for maybe the next couple of quarters. When you think about the performance, is there a way to think about it, in terms of driven by field reps versus digital inbound through marketing? Are there channels, so not by customer size, but are there channels that are doing better or worse in terms of bringing more customers into the top of the funnel, and driving new bookings?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, I think I'll tell you what\u2026\nKathleen Winters: Maybe I'll just interject on before Carlos response to that one, and I want to interject and just follow-up a little bit on the margin story, because Carlos gave a really good kind of recap and summary of the last couple of years. When you think about, we're in the 20% margin, 20.7% to pre-COVID 23% with the various big initiatives that we pursued, and you've heard us talk about that over time. But I want to add that, one of those really important initiatives that we are now working very hard, is digital transformation which has been helping us, right. As we look at our transformation initiatives, we've talked about digital and procurement really driving a lot of the benefit, kind of today if you will, a lot of that procurement does get harder as you go, but from a digital transformation perspective, that's an initiative that we believe is going to be with us for some period of time, because these projects are not fast projects to execute, they do take time to execute, and so we're optimistic that we have got a pipeline of projects and that we will continue to yield benefits for us.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, and I think that, I'll just pile on to that. Your comment I think earlier after you asked question and you summarize my comments, the business is definitely performing much better than it looks, because we have, these client's funds interest headwind is not just the headwind on margin, it's a headwind on revenue growth as well. So almost a 4 percentage point. And as an example on a margin impact, our margin I think in ES would have been up and ADP overall, our margin would have been up 40 basis points instead of down 30 basis points for the quarter. So, clearly on a margin side, the picture is clouded and that picture will and the interest rate go up and down as you know, and everyone is always convince that rates are going to stay low forever, or they're going to stay high forever depending on where they are. But we believe that at a minimum that headwind will abate unless interest rates continue to go down and then turn negative for the next 10 years, which is very unlikely as we all I think, as we all know, at least in the U.S. that's unlikely. On your question about bookings, one thing that's important to note is we do have record leads through digital marketing coming in. So we have increased our investment in digital marketing, but we're very careful to do that to make sure that we're getting the proper ROI. But that is something that is certainly helping our sales force. But really the message for our sales force is that we want them to meet our client, the clients and the prospects where they want to be met. And they have all the tools, all modern tools that any sales force uses. I mean, the reality is, I said this before people steal our sales force. And so we have to understand we have the best sales force in the industry, there's no question about it, and they have all the tools they need to compete effectively. And they had obviously moved to being mostly a virtual sales force over the last six months. And we make sure they had the tools to be able to do that and that's where clients want it to be met. And if in six months, we anticipate that some of our up market and multinational clients will be okay having some digital meetings or virtual meetings, but they might want to have people visiting some of them again, we'll be ready for that as well, assuming that it's safe and that people are vaccinated. So, there are a number of channels that we can pursue, but you should understand that our strategy is really to meet the clients where they want to be met. As an example in the down market, our clients rely on trusted advisors like accountants and brokers, we have very, very strong partner relationships with those channels, and that's how we drive results in that channel. So it really varies channel by channel, but you should understand that we are pursuing every channel, every avenue including upping our digital marketing investments to make sure that, we're getting our fair share of that without throwing money away.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thanks again for taking my questions. I really appreciate the thoughtful answers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKartik Mehta: Good morning. Carlos, you talked about net gains. I'm wondering if that's related strictly to ADP having a better set of products, or is that related to the competition doing something else? And just my second question, you've talked a lot about the sales process. And I'm wondering, if you believe afterward, through this pandemic, get the vaccinations done, that fundamentally if the sales process will change, and that you'll use more digital versus face-to-face? Thank you.\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think, I'm in the same camp as I think many other CEOs of companies that - and again, there's very - there are not a lot of companies like ADP that operate all the way from the down market into the up market. So there has to be balance here in terms of it's not one clear cut answer. But I'm in the camp, for example, in the up market with some of my other competitors, and CEOs who believe that, there will be face-to-face meetings again, and particularly sales meetings. But I'm also in the camp of believing with lots of others that we shouldn't assume that things are going to go back exactly the way they were before. Whether it's with the way people are working, or the way people are selling, we're going to have to adapt to what inevitably is going to be some change. Having said that, I believe I saw a statistic the other day that said that, prior to the pandemic about 10% of the U.S. workforce was working from home. And it went up to 33% at the worst part of the pandemic, and then came back down to 25%. And I kind of monitor this through other sources that show that ticked up slightly again the number of people working from home as this virus continued to surge. But you would expect that 25% to probably go back to 15%, 20%, but not probably back to 10%. But remember that the other 70% never worked from home. And today 75% of the people are not working from home. But that doesn't mean that we haven't learned new techniques. So for example, an initial meeting or a follow-up meeting, or maybe even an implementation meeting with our client, I think we've all learned that. It's much more effective to do that for both parties virtually. But it's hard to believe that we're going to go back exactly to where we were before. It's also very hard to believe that we're going to stay exactly the way we are today. And again, I hate to give you wishy-washy answer because I think we're going to have let that play out. But we are like lot of other things, we're maintaining optionality and equipping our sales force to be prepared for either of those eventualities. And I think you had a first part of that question that\u2026\nKartik Mehta: Client growth, whether its product?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Oh client. On the client growth side, again we are - I think I mentioned in one of my script, that all of our strategic platforms, so if you think about RUN, Workforce Now, Globalview, I forgot the other ones I mentioned, but the platforms that we are that are strategic that we're investing in, not just the Next Gen ones are all growing, and they are growing very robustly, and I don't want to people understand that. And part of the challenge is that, we have a large company and we have other things that maybe aren't growing as fast, or we have a drag from a platform that we're trying to get off of. And we unlike from others try to report the fact as they are. But maybe take a little bit of liberty what others are doing, and giving a little bit more color about just the things that are going well. But if you did that, like we'd only focused on the growth of, for example Next Gen, it would be 800% growth, or if we focused the growth of Workforce Now, across the board, not just in the mid-market, because we also use Workforce Now in the up market, and we use Workforce Now in our PEO, you would see robust growth even in the middle of a pandemic on a Workforce Now. So, I think we're making progress but we're a large organization with large market share and included that exposes our flanks, and we have to be very good at making sure that we protect our flanks which I think we're doing a good job of, as evidenced by retention. But when you look at the go-forward and the growth of our strategic platforms, there is a lot of reasons for optimism that we will I think be able to compete effectively on a go-forward basis. So, I am not sure I can give you lot more detail of that, because this is more detail than we normally give, because we like to just be straight shooters and the growth is what it is, whether it's on client counts or a revenue. But if you want a little bit of additional color underneath the covers, the strategic platforms are doing very well against our competitors.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So, questions basically about Next Gen payroll and Next Gen HCM. The first part is this, can you talk a little bit more, give us a little bit more color with regards to Next Gen Payroll just in terms of the number of clients that have been sold? What percentage of the existing Workforce Now base has been converted? And how you are thinking about that going through? And kind of what you're seeing in terms of the satisfaction, once you have that in place, you made some initial comments, that sounded really positive? And then the follow-up is this basically on Next Gen HCM, just in terms of what the outlook is there in terms of new sales and new bookings? Thanks you.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Sure. Thanks for the question. We thought it was optimistic before prepare yourself, because the story on Next Gen Payroll and HCM is quite positive for us in terms of the future. If you look at Next Gen Payroll, we have I think close to a couple hundred let's say over 200 live clients. So not just old but live clients. We have over 500 that are sold. I think we said in our comments that you may not have picked up on that, we think that it's possible even though this is not scientifically provable that up to 25% of the sales we had so far of Next Gen Payroll we would not obtain without Next Gen Payroll. So I think that bodes well for I think our competitiveness and our market share. And our clients were to have call it somewhere around a couple 1,000, I think for this fiscal year. So, it's positive momentum, again the caveat there is with Next Gen HCM we are generally going after very large clients, and in the case of Next Gen Payroll, it is really a platform that solves our kind of Next Gen Payroll needs across the board and we started and call it the core of our mid-market. So, call it between 50 and a 150 employees really has been our focus. But having said that, it's still pretty impressive and we're pretty happy and pretty positive. Satisfaction levels are very high. And I think we just got great the momentum and the sales force is obviously incredibly excited. Even though, remember, this is still a back-end engine right. So it's still Workforce Now and in the future, it will be lifting on that are using high as an engine. But it does provide some additional benefits to the client and a lot of sizzle as well, as we know that matters as well, given some of our competitors I think have used sizzle in their sales process. And so, we're able to use some sizzle now with Next Gen Payroll. So very excited about that rollout and about the progress there. Our Next Gen HCM, you heard about our rollout in Mexico, which is really Next Gen HCM with Pay. So we have call it, a handful of clients now in four countries that are actually running on Next Gen HCM with Pay. Again, it's very early like to talk about only a handful of clients isn't a lot, but what was most encouraging is that in a couple of those situations we were able to use what we're calling a federated development process, which is one of the intentions whether we invest into the platform which to be able to build rapidly. So, the Mexico client was onboarded in from super messaging  the building platform, getting the client and getting them onboarded in call it six to nine months. So very, very impressive for us to be able to do that. So, we're optimistic that this will continue to hopefully help us again competitively. And I think you also asked about how many clients we've migrated off of Workforce Now on to Pay, and remember that it's we're not migrating clients off of Workforce Now, we're just changing the underlying payroll engine that is still on the Workforce Now. And the outlook of that is I think not many, like this is mostly new logo sales in the case of Next Gen Payroll. Again, underneath Workforce Now. So, as we go to market, it's still Workforce Now with the Pay payroll engine beneath it. And again footnote, I think I said this last quarter, Workforce Now is a Next Gen platform. We don't talk about it that way, because we haven't been talking about it that way, but Workforce Now with Pay is a Next Gen platform.\nMark Marcon: Got it. I appreciate it. Sounds very optimistic. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thank you. Hey, Kathleen, you talked about the digital transformation a couple times. We're in argue kind of in that process and I think the last number you'd referenced was about a $150 million benefit. Is that still the way to think about it in the 150 range? Or does that get accelerated based on some of the investments in your portfolio as a result of the Q2 outperformance?\nKathleen Winters: Yes, Kevin thanks for that question. That 150 still follows, that was our estimated benefit for the year, the current fiscal year from digital and other transformation efforts. Where are we in that journey? I'd say we're in the early days, early I mean, as I mentioned these projects are not chats to implement projects. These are not basically four months projects that you rollout. These are how do we secure or build the right tools to take work out of the system. How do we - well, some of it can be little faster like continuing to build that chatbox functionality and how many inquires  and some of those to go faster. But some of them could be longer projects like, supporting our implementation teams with tools that we're building. So, my view is we're in the early innings here. We've had some good success thus far. We continue to stay very focused on building pipeline of projects. And if everything all part of the company that we expect and that we go to, to say, what are you doing to digitally transform what you do. How do you take work out of the system and its front office and its back office? So, we got a lot more work to do there, and I think that's a really good thing.\nKevin McVeigh: And then just one quick follow-up, maybe  as it relates to that. How does that impact your addressable market, because I'd imagine it probably expands it in terms of average client size, things like that? Is there any way to frame what the transformation is going to mean, in terms of addressable market longer-term?\nCarlos Rodriguez: It's a good question and something that we think about a lot, right, as I think one of the things we want to try to get is we talked about share of wallet, new logos, but we can expand our addressable market that is very helpful. And it really varies business by business. But as an example, we are, I think, in the early stages, I would say, still not ready. I think I'm not supposed to say anything about it. But we think that in the down market, there is part of the addressable market that we could do better with if we had a more kind of end-to-end digital product, if you will, in terms of - so this would be a complement to RUN, that would compete in a segment of the market that we don't compete in today. Likewise, if we go all the way to the up market and international with the acquisition of Celergo was intended to kind of bolster, I think, a market that is growing and that I think is expanded by our acquisition of Celergo. And the Next Gen platforms, if you will, are for sure intended to expand the addressable market. So for example, the Next Gen payroll engine, again with Workforce Now would probably be have more appeal to an in-house user, even though people don't think there's a lot of those left, there are still people who use kind of in-house software if you will. And I think that this Next Gen payroll platform combined with Workforce Now provides more control, which is something that for the last 20 years, when we survey the market, if you will to assess what's addressable, there was always this kind of outsourcing versus in-house. And I think what's happened is that, cloud technology has blurred that line, but there's still a line there. And the ability to have the payroll platform perform some other things that people want from a control standpoint when they're in-house, I think expands that addressable market. And then lastly, in terms of Next Gen HCM, I mean, clearly, the big play there and the big investment was to expand the addressable market in the up market for us, both the larger and more complex clients, but the clients who also had HR needs that, we were not necessarily able to satisfy with some of our older platforms. So definitely, I think, a lot of opportunity and it's a key focus of our strategy in terms of how we develop our products, is to expand the addressable market.\nKathleen Winters: Yes. Kevin, you can think about as our digital work, our digital transformation is meant to improve and accelerate on both top-line and from an efficiency productivity standpoint. From a top-line perspective, whether it's the addressable market and accessing that through Next Gen or other feature improvements that we're making, sales cycle time, shortening that cycle time to get something through the sales process. We're working on that in our PEO business, improving via digital work, improving service. So with improved service, therefore, improved NPS, therefore improved retention. So it's meant to target both acceleration from a top-line perspective and as we've talked about taking work out of the system and productivity.\nKevin McVeigh: Thanks so much.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. And our last question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang of JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thanks so much. Good results and I appreciate the very clear guidance as well. Just a question and a follow-up or clarification. Just on the KPIs, Carlos, that you're most focused on the second half. Just hearing everything you talked about, positive revisions to retention, bookings. I'm curious, if there are any underappreciated KPIs at this point of the cycle that we should be tracking to gauge the sustainability of the improvement that you're talking about, as we get through the second half of the year? And just a clarification, I think you touched upon it in the last comment here. Just the 25% of sales of Next Gen payroll that would not have been attained without it. Is - are you - are those clients on a cloud platform that are looking for a cloud like the controls and whatnot that you're talking about that that was the condition for considering? I'm just trying to understand why they didn't consider it before it if that makes sense?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, listen, I think unfortunately, I don't have that level of detail I'm afraid to say. We would probably maybe follow-up to give you a little more color that's why I tried to use the words not scientific. So our sales force - we are obviously very, very focused on the rollout of our Next Gen platforms. And so as we try to keep close communication and close tab with our sales force on how it's going, and they came to us and said, we think we got 25% more logos as a result of Next Gen Payroll than we would have gotten in the past. I'm guessing there are going to be a number of different reasons for that, including there maybe a little bit of a sizzle factor there, in terms of - because as you know, we run fully compliant payrolls. We help our clients with PPP loans. I mean we were able to do everything, like our existing platforms are the most robust, most comprehensive, most effective, I believe, of course, I'm biased in the industry. But there are incremental improvements, that give people whether it's the control aspect that I mentioned or the sizzle that help sales, and it's no different than you go buy a car and there is five different models of the same car. And people buy the five different cars but you have to have new cars every now and then, and I think it's every five years whatever that cycle is, and I think that's maybe some of what's happening here. But we'll try to get you a little bit of additional color if we can, but that was an intent to spark a kind of a new level of disclosure if you will about what percentage of our 25% came as a result of which feature. But we'll try to provide some color either in the interim, or certainly on the next call, when we're going to have many more clients on Next Gen Payroll, and we'll have a little bit more data for you. On the question you had about KPI's, I would say, you hit on all of them, like there's lot of important ones that you just touched on that we watch and that we share with you. The other ones that I think are important are ones around productivity both for sales, but also for our service and implementation associates. And in particular on sales, that's part of why we're talking about kind of the underlying trends improving, and us being so optimistic about the future is, there's no reason why our sales force can't get to the same productivity, they were pre-pandemic and then continue to increase that productivity as they had been doing for many, many years. And so that's one of those KPIs that we watch very carefully is what's happening to that sales force productivity number quarter-on-quarter, and what's it expected to do in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, and luckily, it's on track and that's something that we watch very carefully. Likewise, the productivity per service rep and productivity of implementation, so as an example, how many new clients can an implementation rep on board, and these are all impacted by the digital transformation that Kathleen was talking about. Because our goal is to make it easier and better for our clients, and as a byproduct, hopefully reduce our operating expenses, not reduce our operating expenses, and then figure out what happens after that, because the most important driver of the long-term value here is client retention. And I can tell you that if we maintain these client retentions, you guys should go do the math on how much faster our revenue will grow on a normal steady state basis with the same bookings. It's pretty powerful. And obviously that's incremental revenue growth that doesn't have incremental sales expense or implementation expense. So the most important thing for us to do is to make good on our commitment to our clients. But having said that, those productivity metrics are important, too, in determining kind of our ability to drive margin into the future, because those are two big buckets of expense, our service and implementation costs. And again, that's another item where the KPI that would really be around not just NPFs and retention, but around productivity. And the good news there is that we've been showing really good productivity improvements, while we've also been driving very good retention, which speaks to the success of our digital transformation efforts.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Very clear. Thanks so much.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.\nEnd of Q&A:\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, I think I mentioned already that it's hard to imagine where we were just a quarter ago, because I think on the same call a quarter ago, there was no vaccine, there was no stimulus approved and there was no new administration in Washington. We were still waiting for or looking forward to an election. So, besides all of the great things that our associates are doing in terms of execution, our sales force and all of our associates, in terms of helping our clients through this and helping each other, I just thank God for where we are today versus where we were last quarter, because we know now, I think we knew some of us knew that we would be okay eventually. But now, we know for sure that we're going to be okay in terms of our friends, our families, but also our economy and I think our companies and the things that we also value on the professional side. So, very excited about the prospects of getting through the next month or two, which I know we're going to be challenging for all of us, but also looking forward to much better times ahead to plenty of pent-up demand, to growth and productivity, to strong GDP and all the great things that are going to happen once we finally defeat the virus and move on. So I would just close by saying, thank you to the scientists, the pharmaceutical companies and everyone else who got us to where we are today and that continue to move us forward as a country and as a globe. And I appreciate you all joining the call and listening to us today. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the program, you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter across every major business metric. While we will still see some pandemic related headwinds for the balance of the year, we are more confident in our outlook given we believe the toughest part is behind us. Our performance thus far into the year reaffirms the resilience of our business model, the strength of our product, and the ability of our sales and service teams to perform even in the toughest of environments. We remain confident in our ability to execute as we move forward. In the second quarter, our revenues grew 1% on a reported basis, flat on an organic constant currency basis, which is significantly better than our expectations coming into the year and better than even the revised expectations we had as of last quarter. Once again, ES retention rates represented favorability as did very strong performance from our PEO. We managed expenses prudently, while making important incremental growth and productivity investments and delivered margins that were better than our expectations. Our adjusted EBIT was down just 1% despite pressure from a decline in client funds interest. Our adjusted effective tax rate increased 20 basis points, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Our share count was lower year-over-year, driven by share repurchases. And as a result, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.52 was flat versus last year second quarter. Moving on to the segments. For ES, our revenues declined 1% on a reported basis, and 2% on inorganic constant currency basis, representing continued sequential improvements driven by record level retention, and the more modest 6% decline in pays for control versus 9% last quarter. Client funds interest declined 23%, as average yield declined 50 basis points versus last year. Sure. So on the SG&A side, I mean, you do have a lot of things within that SG&A. But I would think about it this way. The overall view or picture is that from a selling standpoint, I'll talk about kind of full year, and then we can talk about linearity. But from an overall standpoint, we continue to invest in sales, as we've mentioned, and that is both headcount investment, as well as continuing to look at marketing investment and doing some of that. So you've got that investment in sales, but you've also got the work we're doing around transformation, which would be offsetting that investment, as well as just discretionary cost control that we're very focused on doing as well. So kind of overall, you've got investment, headcount and marketing, you've got transformation work that we continue to do, and discretionary cost control. That does change if you look at or not change, but the SKU first half the second half is a little bit different, as we do have significant bookings growth in Q4, our expectation, and so of course, that's going to result in higher Q4 selling expense for us. Bryan, if I could just interject the only other detail I'd add on all of that data that Carlos mentioned that we do look at an ongoing basis, is that when we look at the leading indicators in terms of the data we have, so appointments, referrals, demos, opportunities created, as you know, our sales team are inputting leads into the system. All of those are trending better going into the second half than they were before going into the year. And so we're feeling really very optimistic, as you can tell from the raised bookings guidance. We're feeling optimistic going into the second half of the year. In particular the digital leads are up significantly. So, again, just wanted to provide that transparency for you. Maybe I'll just interject on before Carlos response to that one, and I want to interject and just follow-up a little bit on the margin story, because Carlos gave a really good kind of recap and summary of the last couple of years. When you think about, we're in the 20% margin, 20.7% to pre-COVID 23% with the various big initiatives that we pursued, and you've heard us talk about that over time. But I want to add that, one of those really important initiatives that we are now working very hard, is digital transformation which has been helping us, right. As we look at our transformation initiatives, we've talked about digital and procurement really driving a lot of the benefit, kind of today if you will, a lot of that procurement does get harder as you go, but from a digital transformation perspective, that's an initiative that we believe is going to be with us for some period of time, because these projects are not fast projects to execute, they do take time to execute, and so we're optimistic that we have got a pipeline of projects and that we will continue to yield benefits for us. Yes, Kevin thanks for that question. That 150 still follows, that was our estimated benefit for the year, the current fiscal year from digital and other transformation efforts. Where are we in that journey? I'd say we're in the early days, early I mean, as I mentioned these projects are not chats to implement projects. These are not basically four months projects that you rollout. These are how do we secure or build the right tools to take work out of the system. How do we - well, some of it can be little faster like continuing to build that chatbox functionality and how many inquires  and some of those to go faster. But some of them could be longer projects like, supporting our implementation teams with tools that we're building. So, my view is we're in the early innings here. We've had some good success thus far. We continue to stay very focused on building pipeline of projects. And if everything all part of the company that we expect and that we go to, to say, what are you doing to digitally transform what you do. How do you take work out of the system and its front office and its back office? So, we got a lot more work to do there, and I think that's a really good thing. Yes. Kevin, you can think about as our digital work, our digital transformation is meant to improve and accelerate on both top-line and from an efficiency productivity standpoint. From a top-line perspective, whether it's the addressable market and accessing that through Next Gen or other feature improvements that we're making, sales cycle time, shortening that cycle time to get something through the sales process. We're working on that in our PEO business, improving via digital work, improving service. So with improved service, therefore, improved NPS, therefore improved retention. So it's meant to target both acceleration from a top-line perspective and as we've talked about taking work out of the system and productivity."

            "name": "Carlos Rodriguez",
            "content": "Thank you, Danny, and thank you everyone for joining our call. This morning we reported results reflecting our continued strong business performance and momentum, with our second quarter revenue and margins both outperforming our expectations, as our business continued to demonstrate resilience in the face of ongoing economic headwinds. We reported revenue of $3.7 billion, up 1% on a reported basis and flat on an organic constant currency basis, with adjusted EBIT margin down 30 basis points. Coupled with a slight increase in the effective tax rate versus last year, our share count reduction our adjusted diluted EPS was flat versus last year, much better than the decrease we were expecting. During the second quarter, we continue to see signs of improvement in the overall operating environment, with the positive implications for pays per control, new business bookings and retention. Our pays per control metric performed slightly better than expected, as it improved sequentially to a decline of 6% versus the larger declines we experienced in Q1 in the latter part of fiscal 2020. Underlying employment trends in Q2 were consistent with what we experienced in Q1, with larger enterprises somewhat slower to show improvement, but with small and midsize businesses demonstrating a healthy level of hiring. We performed well on employer services new business bookings. Even though bookings declined 7% this quarter, this was well ahead of our initial expectations earlier this year, and in line with the revised expectations we communicated last quarter. And it's important to point out, that our new business bookings for the first half nearly matched last year's half, despite the very difficult environment. Sure, let me take the - I'll take the bookings maybe and I'll let Kathleen talk about the SG&A. On the bookings, and I think some of this is just the lumpiness if you will of the results, because there's no - there are a couple of things that happened but it's hard to call it a trend right, because we only have really two quarters if you will of post-pandemic results. But in essence, our mid-market business performed a lot better. So, workforce now and the mid-market business did much better in this quarter than in the last quarter. And then, if you remember, last quarter we talked about that we got some help from our international business and in particular we called out multinational deals, and that was I'm not sure we gave any color around that, but that was strong double-digits is the way I would put it, last quarter helped the last quarter's growth. And this quarter it was kind of slightly negative. Now in the context of what's happening in Europe, which really started to shut down and started to have challenges before the U.S. in terms of the resurgence of the virus, we're pretty happy with that. Like we're pretty proud of our sales teams over there that they were able to accomplish what they did in the second quarter, but sequentially it was not as strong as the help we got in the first quarter. We also had really strong bookings in the first quarter in our down-market business, we had some, what I would call modest help from some - what we call client conversions or we call client-based acquisitions, which we do on a regular basis, but they don't come in every single quarter, so we got a little bit of help from that. And I think I also mentioned last quarter, I think I've been doing this for nine years mentioning that whenever we have a strong finish to a year, we typically get off to a slower start. And the opposite is also true, when we have a really bad year, we tend to get off to a stronger start. A lot of our business is counted at the time of sale and start, but some of our businesses, as you know, like in the up market, there is some flexibility if you will in the sales force. We don't necessarily endorse that, but there is some flexibility for salespeople to book something in call it July versus in May. And because of the way the incentives work and so forth, sometimes we get a little bit of movement from sales into the next fiscal year, if we have a bad fiscal year and the opposite is also true. We'll have a strong fiscal year. We tend to have a hard time getting started in July. But I think we've been - so this is nothing new. We've been I think transparent, giving you all the kind of the color that we can around bookings. I will tell you that when we cut through all that, so we're trying to look at no different than you would do with for example, earnings, where we trying to see what's the core business doing excluding client funds interest, what's happening with the core business excluding pressure from pays per control. We do the same thing in bookings, like what's happening in the core underlying bookings. And we see very positive momentum there, in terms of lead generation, digital leads coming in activity by the sales force. So we're optimistic that the momentum will continue into the third and fourth quarter. Of course, the caveat being, the virus has to cooperate in terms of and the vaccine rollout has to continue to stay on track. But I think overall, if you cut through all the - it's not fair to call them onetime items, but if you cut through all the noise, our momentum in the second quarter, in terms of bookings was stronger than it was in the first quarter, even though it might not be what the reported number shows. And I'll let Kathleen talk about the SG&A. Sure. On a pipeline question, we do have some visibility. But some of this is really about extrapolating momentum, because in the down market, it's really more about headcount and productivity than it is about pipeline or as in the M&C in the up market. I mean, I'm not telling you anything you wouldn't be able to figure out yourself. So we have a fair amount of visibility in some part of our business, but in other parts of our business, we based on our experience about productivity metrics and headcount and so forth, we have confidence, obviously, in the guidance that we're giving and the raise, otherwise we wouldn't be giving it. But, as couple of things that have changed since last quarter, last quarter we had - what we thought was much better results than we had expected, and we thought we had positive momentum and then on top of that, now we have a vaccine rollout. So that was not something that was it was talked about. But this is now a reality. We also had an election that was still in front of us and that's been resolved. We also thought and people speculated there would be more stimulus and now there is, even though there's even more stimulus being debated, just as a reminder, there was a $900 billion stimulus package that was approved. So I think if you look at what we try to do, we try to do a little bit of kind of correlation, regression, whatever you want to call it, between GDP and economic growth and our bookings, because we do believe there is some connection there. Like there's other things like the training of our sales force, the tools they have, the quality of the sales force, the turnover. But GDP is a powerful force and the GDP numbers are looking pretty strong here on a go forward basis, with perhaps the exception by some of our analysts out there of our third quarter, the quarter we're in right now. But if you look at fourth quarter, our fourth quarter or the first half of next fiscal year for us and then the next calendar year after that, I mean, even this full calendar year GDP expectation has been raised, I think, across the board by everyone. So I think it's partly visibility and pipeline and partly our experience that we know, for example, what a reasonable expectation is for productivity per DM per sales rep. We know how many sales reps we have, we know how many new ones we're hiring. We know what we're generating in terms of leads and digital marketing. And I think we put that all together and that comes out to our guidance. And so I think we're confident in it and we're actually very excited and positive that we were able to do that. And we're just glad that things are looking much better than they were last quarter and certainly better than they were looking in March and in April. On the\u2026 And then on the on the retention side, I would say there's probably two data points that I would look at. The retention obviously is incredibly strong and it's going to be record retention for the year, assuming we have the guidance that we've just provided. We've never been at these retention levels. And I think there's a number of factors. I mean, I think our product set is much stronger and it's not just the products themselves, but it's our commitment to moving our clients onto our newer platform. So we have a lot more clients on newer platforms today than we had a year ago, two years ago, whether a quarter ago or a year ago, it's just a continuing progression that we've talked about now for many, many years. But we've made a lot of progress and we know that the retention on our new platforms is higher than on some of our older platforms. So that's helping. There's probably some tailwind from this pandemic related, we just can't put our finger on it. The clients are maybe not moving as much. But if you look at each business unit, like, for example, in our down market, the retention in our down market as a result of better product and better execution has been going up for probably six or seven years and is up almost 500 basis points pre pandemic, and that's gone up even more. So the fact that we've had this positive momentum in the down market, it's a similar story and Workforce Now, if not 500 basis points. But in the mid-market, we've also had three years of improving retention pre pandemic. So I think those are signs that there is something happening in terms of our execution and our product. So, execution is part of it as well, we have to deliver I think on the commitments we make to our clients to resolve issues for them, and answer questions and so. So, it's a combination of better service, excellent service and really better products and migrating clients, I think is helping. And then secondly, the other data point that I would point to which is really on the bookings side, a combination of bookings and retention that our balance of trade is improving with several of our major competitors for the first time in a while. I think, it's again, related to this effort that we've made to improve product, continue to deliver great service,  on execution. And I think it's showing up now in some of these balance of trade numbers we're showing some improvement. So, the reason I bring that up is because balance of trade with the combination of what we're bringing in, in terms of from some of our competitors but also what we're losing to those same competitors. That's why we call it balance of trade. So, there's a number of metrics that would tell me that our competitive position is getting better, and then resulting obviously in higher retention and hopefully also growing booking here in the future. So, let me take the second one first on divergence. Yes, we would see what we would expect to see, because we are, I think, we're big enough that we kind of really escape again the gravitational pull of overall GDP, but also of specific geographic challenges. So, in Southern California for example, we did see some challenges in terms of our bookings in the down market and into the mid-market there. It's still impressive if we were able to sell as much as we did. As a footnote, we sold a lot of the say that we're flat, almost flat for us, it's at least, we're impressed with ourselves that our bookings are flat for the first half of the year versus last year. But there clearly are pockets of challenges. Southern California would be a challenge, the Midwest was and the Central part of the country was incredibly challenged for several months. But we had other places that things were better as a result of maybe more economic activity, or continuing opening regardless of the controversy around that. And then, again, Europe would be a place where I would call out where I think we started to encounter some real headwinds. So, the geographies were up and not just about U.S. it's also global. So, the answer is yes, and that you should assume that we would be impacted by whatever you're seeing in the news. And so, when you have hard lockdowns in very large metropolitan markets, that would affect us but fortunately, we're very diversified geographically and across segments. So, remember, we operate all the way from small to up market to international and so, we obviously we try to find a way to keep follow these things in balance, and have something helping us, when other things maybe working against us. So, we did see some of that volatility as you described. On the price side, so one of the things we did talk about last quarter, we did talk about competitors and what we heard anecdotally about competitor pricing action, but we also said last quarter that we didn't get any help from price last quarter. We did get a little bit of help. It was not significant but all around, I think was around 30 basis points of help, which is about normally what we would be getting and to the revenue growth help from price. And so, I think what tells you this, what we're trying to signal to you there is to tell you that it was appropriate for us to pause for call it, four to five months our normal price increases. By the way, our normal price increases would have been July 1st would have been one of the main times that we do price increases. And remember, our price increases are much more modest than they were five, 10 years ago. But at our scale, it does matter. But we delayed those price increases. It was not appropriate if you do that given the circumstances that we were under. But you fast forward to September, October, we felt that given the additional services that we were providing. So we're providing a number of incremental services at no additional cost to our clients that I believe our competitors are not providing. And so we thought that going back to our normal modest price increases was a reasonable thing to do and we did that. And you can see the impact on retention which has been none. And so that would be I think a good sign for us. It's a great question, because there's still a lot of room for us there. We're very focused on market share and new unit growth. But we don't mind additional share of wallet and additional tax rate, because that's helpful too. And as you know, our bookings have generally been balanced for many, many years, about half of it coming from new logos, and half of it coming from incremental attach. So we love that business. I happen to be looking at those figures last night and it obviously varies by business unit. But as an example, in the mid-market, we're kind of in the 60% to 70% range, in terms of a tax rate for things like workforce management, which we used to call time and labor management, and benefits administration. And we have things like data cloud and other items that we can attach as well. But I think the best color to put on that is that there's still a lot of room. I mentioned how we are doing well, not just in our new strategic platforms, but we're also doing well on some of our products that we don't always talk about a lot on these calls like retirement services, insurance services where those tax rates are very low in comparison to what I think is the potential for our client base. Because when you have a tightly integrated solution, it really is a much better experience for our clients. So it's good for us, but it's also good for our clients, which is always an important thing. So I guess the color I would put there is we've got really good tax rates on some of the core HCM modules, like workforce management, then admin. So HR payroll, then admin, workforce management, those are kind of the core talent management is a place where we've been seeing growing tax rates, and there's a lot of room still there for people to adopt those solutions. So, we're very optimistic and this is a key strategy for - I think my predecessor before that, which has been great for us that we have a very broad industry. Part of our reason for concentrating on HCM and focusing the company away from some of the other businesses we have like a brokerage business, and dealer services and so forth is this is a growing robust space globally, and there's plenty of room to grow. We definitely want to still focused on  off of market share and logo growth. But there's an enormous opportunity for us in terms of incremental tax rate. Yes. Let me give you a little bit of color on that, because, again, incidentally, I was doing my homework last night. So I did go back that's something that I actually have fresh on my mind. And then will correct me if I'm wrong. But I think our margin in '18, which you would have seen in that Analyst Day, was 20.7. And we're now, I think, forecasting for fiscal year '21, I'm not sure that we're forecasting it, but I think you can extrapolate based on our guidance. I'll just throw out a number. So call it 22.3, 22.5 somewhere in that range for fiscal year '21. That's with a significant drag from client funds interest, as you mentioned, and some drag from COVID as a result of slower than we would have thought or would have expected revenue growth. So I would say that on the margin side, we would be well ahead of what we talked about at Analyst Day, excluding these items. On the revenue side, clearly, we're not anywhere near that, hence why we had to withdraw that three-year guidance we had provided, because obviously the COVID headwinds with what happened with pays per control and just the economy in general made it very difficult. But again, it feels like this is a transitory event, as we've talked about now for two or three quarters, painful, devastating for many people, for our country, for the economy and for the world. But it is transitory and not an existential threat. And so we expect to get right back on the track that we were on before. And I happen to think that the fact that we're a couple hundred basis points higher in margin, even with everything that's happened than we were in '18, I think tells you something about the structural margin opportunity in the business. But, clearly a very important part of that picture is growth. We need to grow the business long-term, because growth does require investment and so you should be hearing from us as we care about margin and we think there's opportunity in terms of structural margins here going forward, but the most important thing we can do to drive long-term shareholder value here is to also grow the top-line. And we're focused on that. Yes, I think I'll tell you what\u2026 Yes, and I think that, I'll just pile on to that. Your comment I think earlier after you asked question and you summarize my comments, the business is definitely performing much better than it looks, because we have, these client's funds interest headwind is not just the headwind on margin, it's a headwind on revenue growth as well. So almost a 4 percentage point. And as an example on a margin impact, our margin I think in ES would have been up and ADP overall, our margin would have been up 40 basis points instead of down 30 basis points for the quarter. So, clearly on a margin side, the picture is clouded and that picture will and the interest rate go up and down as you know, and everyone is always convince that rates are going to stay low forever, or they're going to stay high forever depending on where they are. But we believe that at a minimum that headwind will abate unless interest rates continue to go down and then turn negative for the next 10 years, which is very unlikely as we all I think, as we all know, at least in the U.S. that's unlikely. On your question about bookings, one thing that's important to note is we do have record leads through digital marketing coming in. So we have increased our investment in digital marketing, but we're very careful to do that to make sure that we're getting the proper ROI. But that is something that is certainly helping our sales force. But really the message for our sales force is that we want them to meet our client, the clients and the prospects where they want to be met. And they have all the tools, all modern tools that any sales force uses. I mean, the reality is, I said this before people steal our sales force. And so we have to understand we have the best sales force in the industry, there's no question about it, and they have all the tools they need to compete effectively. And they had obviously moved to being mostly a virtual sales force over the last six months. And we make sure they had the tools to be able to do that and that's where clients want it to be met. And if in six months, we anticipate that some of our up market and multinational clients will be okay having some digital meetings or virtual meetings, but they might want to have people visiting some of them again, we'll be ready for that as well, assuming that it's safe and that people are vaccinated. So, there are a number of channels that we can pursue, but you should understand that our strategy is really to meet the clients where they want to be met. As an example in the down market, our clients rely on trusted advisors like accountants and brokers, we have very, very strong partner relationships with those channels, and that's how we drive results in that channel. So it really varies channel by channel, but you should understand that we are pursuing every channel, every avenue including upping our digital marketing investments to make sure that, we're getting our fair share of that without throwing money away. I think, I'm in the same camp as I think many other CEOs of companies that - and again, there's very - there are not a lot of companies like ADP that operate all the way from the down market into the up market. So there has to be balance here in terms of it's not one clear cut answer. But I'm in the camp, for example, in the up market with some of my other competitors, and CEOs who believe that, there will be face-to-face meetings again, and particularly sales meetings. But I'm also in the camp of believing with lots of others that we shouldn't assume that things are going to go back exactly the way they were before. Whether it's with the way people are working, or the way people are selling, we're going to have to adapt to what inevitably is going to be some change. Having said that, I believe I saw a statistic the other day that said that, prior to the pandemic about 10% of the U.S. workforce was working from home. And it went up to 33% at the worst part of the pandemic, and then came back down to 25%. And I kind of monitor this through other sources that show that ticked up slightly again the number of people working from home as this virus continued to surge. But you would expect that 25% to probably go back to 15%, 20%, but not probably back to 10%. But remember that the other 70% never worked from home. And today 75% of the people are not working from home. But that doesn't mean that we haven't learned new techniques. So for example, an initial meeting or a follow-up meeting, or maybe even an implementation meeting with our client, I think we've all learned that. It's much more effective to do that for both parties virtually. But it's hard to believe that we're going to go back exactly to where we were before. It's also very hard to believe that we're going to stay exactly the way we are today. And again, I hate to give you wishy-washy answer because I think we're going to have let that play out. But we are like lot of other things, we're maintaining optionality and equipping our sales force to be prepared for either of those eventualities. And I think you had a first part of that question that\u2026 Oh client. On the client growth side, again we are - I think I mentioned in one of my script, that all of our strategic platforms, so if you think about RUN, Workforce Now, Globalview, I forgot the other ones I mentioned, but the platforms that we are that are strategic that we're investing in, not just the Next Gen ones are all growing, and they are growing very robustly, and I don't want to people understand that. And part of the challenge is that, we have a large company and we have other things that maybe aren't growing as fast, or we have a drag from a platform that we're trying to get off of. And we unlike from others try to report the fact as they are. But maybe take a little bit of liberty what others are doing, and giving a little bit more color about just the things that are going well. But if you did that, like we'd only focused on the growth of, for example Next Gen, it would be 800% growth, or if we focused the growth of Workforce Now, across the board, not just in the mid-market, because we also use Workforce Now in the up market, and we use Workforce Now in our PEO, you would see robust growth even in the middle of a pandemic on a Workforce Now. So, I think we're making progress but we're a large organization with large market share and included that exposes our flanks, and we have to be very good at making sure that we protect our flanks which I think we're doing a good job of, as evidenced by retention. But when you look at the go-forward and the growth of our strategic platforms, there is a lot of reasons for optimism that we will I think be able to compete effectively on a go-forward basis. So, I am not sure I can give you lot more detail of that, because this is more detail than we normally give, because we like to just be straight shooters and the growth is what it is, whether it's on client counts or a revenue. But if you want a little bit of additional color underneath the covers, the strategic platforms are doing very well against our competitors. Sure. Thanks for the question. We thought it was optimistic before prepare yourself, because the story on Next Gen Payroll and HCM is quite positive for us in terms of the future. If you look at Next Gen Payroll, we have I think close to a couple hundred let's say over 200 live clients. So not just old but live clients. We have over 500 that are sold. I think we said in our comments that you may not have picked up on that, we think that it's possible even though this is not scientifically provable that up to 25% of the sales we had so far of Next Gen Payroll we would not obtain without Next Gen Payroll. So I think that bodes well for I think our competitiveness and our market share. And our clients were to have call it somewhere around a couple 1,000, I think for this fiscal year. So, it's positive momentum, again the caveat there is with Next Gen HCM we are generally going after very large clients, and in the case of Next Gen Payroll, it is really a platform that solves our kind of Next Gen Payroll needs across the board and we started and call it the core of our mid-market. So, call it between 50 and a 150 employees really has been our focus. But having said that, it's still pretty impressive and we're pretty happy and pretty positive. Satisfaction levels are very high. And I think we just got great the momentum and the sales force is obviously incredibly excited. Even though, remember, this is still a back-end engine right. So it's still Workforce Now and in the future, it will be lifting on that are using high as an engine. But it does provide some additional benefits to the client and a lot of sizzle as well, as we know that matters as well, given some of our competitors I think have used sizzle in their sales process. And so, we're able to use some sizzle now with Next Gen Payroll. So very excited about that rollout and about the progress there. Our Next Gen HCM, you heard about our rollout in Mexico, which is really Next Gen HCM with Pay. So we have call it, a handful of clients now in four countries that are actually running on Next Gen HCM with Pay. Again, it's very early like to talk about only a handful of clients isn't a lot, but what was most encouraging is that in a couple of those situations we were able to use what we're calling a federated development process, which is one of the intentions whether we invest into the platform which to be able to build rapidly. So, the Mexico client was onboarded in from super messaging  the building platform, getting the client and getting them onboarded in call it six to nine months. So very, very impressive for us to be able to do that. So, we're optimistic that this will continue to hopefully help us again competitively. And I think you also asked about how many clients we've migrated off of Workforce Now on to Pay, and remember that it's we're not migrating clients off of Workforce Now, we're just changing the underlying payroll engine that is still on the Workforce Now. And the outlook of that is I think not many, like this is mostly new logo sales in the case of Next Gen Payroll. Again, underneath Workforce Now. So, as we go to market, it's still Workforce Now with the Pay payroll engine beneath it. And again footnote, I think I said this last quarter, Workforce Now is a Next Gen platform. We don't talk about it that way, because we haven't been talking about it that way, but Workforce Now with Pay is a Next Gen platform. It's a good question and something that we think about a lot, right, as I think one of the things we want to try to get is we talked about share of wallet, new logos, but we can expand our addressable market that is very helpful. And it really varies business by business. But as an example, we are, I think, in the early stages, I would say, still not ready. I think I'm not supposed to say anything about it. But we think that in the down market, there is part of the addressable market that we could do better with if we had a more kind of end-to-end digital product, if you will, in terms of - so this would be a complement to RUN, that would compete in a segment of the market that we don't compete in today. Likewise, if we go all the way to the up market and international with the acquisition of Celergo was intended to kind of bolster, I think, a market that is growing and that I think is expanded by our acquisition of Celergo. And the Next Gen platforms, if you will, are for sure intended to expand the addressable market. So for example, the Next Gen payroll engine, again with Workforce Now would probably be have more appeal to an in-house user, even though people don't think there's a lot of those left, there are still people who use kind of in-house software if you will. And I think that this Next Gen payroll platform combined with Workforce Now provides more control, which is something that for the last 20 years, when we survey the market, if you will to assess what's addressable, there was always this kind of outsourcing versus in-house. And I think what's happened is that, cloud technology has blurred that line, but there's still a line there. And the ability to have the payroll platform perform some other things that people want from a control standpoint when they're in-house, I think expands that addressable market. And then lastly, in terms of Next Gen HCM, I mean, clearly, the big play there and the big investment was to expand the addressable market in the up market for us, both the larger and more complex clients, but the clients who also had HR needs that, we were not necessarily able to satisfy with some of our older platforms. So definitely, I think, a lot of opportunity and it's a key focus of our strategy in terms of how we develop our products, is to expand the addressable market. Yes, listen, I think unfortunately, I don't have that level of detail I'm afraid to say. We would probably maybe follow-up to give you a little more color that's why I tried to use the words not scientific. So our sales force - we are obviously very, very focused on the rollout of our Next Gen platforms. And so as we try to keep close communication and close tab with our sales force on how it's going, and they came to us and said, we think we got 25% more logos as a result of Next Gen Payroll than we would have gotten in the past. I'm guessing there are going to be a number of different reasons for that, including there maybe a little bit of a sizzle factor there, in terms of - because as you know, we run fully compliant payrolls. We help our clients with PPP loans. I mean we were able to do everything, like our existing platforms are the most robust, most comprehensive, most effective, I believe, of course, I'm biased in the industry. But there are incremental improvements, that give people whether it's the control aspect that I mentioned or the sizzle that help sales, and it's no different than you go buy a car and there is five different models of the same car. And people buy the five different cars but you have to have new cars every now and then, and I think it's every five years whatever that cycle is, and I think that's maybe some of what's happening here. But we'll try to get you a little bit of additional color if we can, but that was an intent to spark a kind of a new level of disclosure if you will about what percentage of our 25% came as a result of which feature. But we'll try to provide some color either in the interim, or certainly on the next call, when we're going to have many more clients on Next Gen Payroll, and we'll have a little bit more data for you. On the question you had about KPI's, I would say, you hit on all of them, like there's lot of important ones that you just touched on that we watch and that we share with you. The other ones that I think are important are ones around productivity both for sales, but also for our service and implementation associates. And in particular on sales, that's part of why we're talking about kind of the underlying trends improving, and us being so optimistic about the future is, there's no reason why our sales force can't get to the same productivity, they were pre-pandemic and then continue to increase that productivity as they had been doing for many, many years. And so that's one of those KPIs that we watch very carefully is what's happening to that sales force productivity number quarter-on-quarter, and what's it expected to do in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, and luckily, it's on track and that's something that we watch very carefully. Likewise, the productivity per service rep and productivity of implementation, so as an example, how many new clients can an implementation rep on board, and these are all impacted by the digital transformation that Kathleen was talking about. Because our goal is to make it easier and better for our clients, and as a byproduct, hopefully reduce our operating expenses, not reduce our operating expenses, and then figure out what happens after that, because the most important driver of the long-term value here is client retention. And I can tell you that if we maintain these client retentions, you guys should go do the math on how much faster our revenue will grow on a normal steady state basis with the same bookings. It's pretty powerful. And obviously that's incremental revenue growth that doesn't have incremental sales expense or implementation expense. So the most important thing for us to do is to make good on our commitment to our clients. But having said that, those productivity metrics are important, too, in determining kind of our ability to drive margin into the future, because those are two big buckets of expense, our service and implementation costs. And again, that's another item where the KPI that would really be around not just NPFs and retention, but around productivity. And the good news there is that we've been showing really good productivity improvements, while we've also been driving very good retention, which speaks to the success of our digital transformation efforts. Well, I think I mentioned already that it's hard to imagine where we were just a quarter ago, because I think on the same call a quarter ago, there was no vaccine, there was no stimulus approved and there was no new administration in Washington. We were still waiting for or looking forward to an election. So, besides all of the great things that our associates are doing in terms of execution, our sales force and all of our associates, in terms of helping our clients through this and helping each other, I just thank God for where we are today versus where we were last quarter, because we know now, I think we knew some of us knew that we would be okay eventually. But now, we know for sure that we're going to be okay in terms of our friends, our families, but also our economy and I think our companies and the things that we also value on the professional side. So, very excited about the prospects of getting through the next month or two, which I know we're going to be challenging for all of us, but also looking forward to much better times ahead to plenty of pent-up demand, to growth and productivity, to strong GDP and all the great things that are going to happen once we finally defeat the virus and move on. So I would just close by saying, thank you to the scientists, the pharmaceutical companies and everyone else who got us to where we are today and that continue to move us forward as a country and as a globe. And I appreciate you all joining the call and listening to us today. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's First Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. And all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanyal Hussain: Thank you, Crystal. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining ADP's first quarter fiscal 2021 earnings call and webcast. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Kathleen Winters, our Chief Financial Officer. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and on our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call as well as our quarterly history of revenue and pretax earnings by reportable segment. During our call today, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out, should you have any questions. And with that, let me turn the call over to Carlos.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. This morning, we reported excellent first quarter fiscal 2021 results. I'm very pleased to say that across the board, we delivered a very strong start to the year that was well in excess of our expectations. For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $3.5 billion down just 1% on both reported and organic constant currency basis. And our adjusted EBIT margin was up 120 basis points, coupled with a slight increase in the effective tax rate versus last year in a share count reduction. Our adjusted diluted EPS grew 5%, much better than our expectation three months ago, which was for a meaningful decrease in EPS. On this call, we'll discuss the changes that drove ADP\u2019s better-than-expected start the fiscal 2021. In Q1, macroeconomic conditions continued to gradually improve and we executed extremely well in several key categories, including better-than-expected sales performance, a continued commitment to client service and prudent expense management. Let me start by covering key macro related trends to provide context to our results. Specifically on pays per control, out-of-business losses and client funds interest. During the first quarter, pays per control, which as a reminder declined 11% in the fourth quarter was in line with our expectation for high single-digit decline with a year-over-year decline of 9%. And a continuation of the trend we saw into our fiscal 2020 year-end, employment small businesses continued to show the most improvement, while large businesses actually showed some degradation as we exited the first quarter. Out-of-business losses performed better-than-expected as small business losses stabilized and a substantial number of clients that had gone inactive last quarter have restarted processing activities over the last three months. Finally, average client funds interest rates declined in line with our expectations for the quarter, but client funds balances were favorable to our expectations, declining 7% compared to our double-digit expectation. With that said, let me shift to the highlights resulting from our own execution. We delivered positive 2% growth in employer services new business bookings, which was significantly ahead of our expectations and marked a record Q1 performance. As you may recall from our commentary last quarter, we did expect some amount of sequential improvement relative to our Q4 bookings performance as economic condition stabilized. However, we delivered a much faster reacceleration as our sales force started strong in July and carry that momentum through the end of the quarter. We attribute the rapid reacceleration to a few key factors. First, we did see our clients and prospects show greater willingness to engage and purchase. But second and most importantly, we took action by maintaining our overall investment in sales and marketing, applying our best-in-class inside sales expertise to continue training our field sales force and utilizing innovative demos and other HCM content to start conversations. We've designed a client acquisition funnel that is successful even in the current environment. Our teams delivered across the board. That's everything from the downmarket where RUN continues to grow. And in fact, we've now exceeded 700,000 RUN clients for the first-time surpassing pre-COVID levels to the mid-market, where we're seeing clients showing more interest in fully outsourced HRO solutions to the enterprise space, where we had strong traction in compliance-related solutions. Our international sales were also strong as we closed several larger deals that were previously put on hold as prospects were waiting for a more stable environment to proceed. And our tax rates on many of our solutions continue to increase as well. This quarter, our workforce management solutions also referred to as time and attendance reached the 90,000 milestone for the first-time. And we're pleased to see that continue to grow our revenue. Our revenue outperformance was also driven by stronger retention. We are very proud to report that we hit record employer services retention levels for a Q1 period and our performance likewise experienced \u2013 and our PEO performance likewise experienced stronger than expected retention. While our retention likely benefited from having some clients delayed decisions to switch HCM vendors, given elevated uncertainty, higher client satisfaction clearly contributed as well. You may recall that last quarter we delivered record NPS scores across our businesses. As we helped our clients manage through government programs like the PPP. This quarter, I'm happy to say that across our businesses, we either maintained or reached new record NPS levels. We believe these results show that our commitment to providing outstanding service to our clients is paying off and we'll continue to do so. Combination of stronger bookings and retention in Q1 drove better revenue performance and the high incremental profitability associated with those revenues plus prudent expense management ultimately drove stronger margin performance as well. This is another great example of execution by our associates. And in a few minutes, Kathleen will cover our margin performance in more detail. I'd like to now provide an update on the progress we continue to make in driving innovation. Earlier this month, as part of the annual HR Tech Conference, ADP was given the Top HR Product award. This marks a record-setting six consecutive year that we have been recognized at the conference for breakthrough technology innovations, which is representative of how we remain committed to leading the industry with the premier HCM technology. This year, we were recognized for our Next Gen Payroll engine. And as we highlighted in our February Innovation Day, the benefits of this new engine include a policy-based framework that enables easy self-service and powerful transparency that allows practitioners and employees to more easily understand the effects of regulatory policy or potential life changes and is designed to be scaled globally. We continue to deploy our Next Gen engine to the market and we added another 100 clients during the first quarter. We remain excited about expanding its availability and driving adoption. And the feedback so far has been overwhelmingly positive. Ultimately, we expect a higher level of satisfaction to generate even better retention and higher win rates, supporting our long-term revenue growth trajectory. And we continue to innovate throughout our ecosystem. This quarter, the ADP marketplace reached 500 app listings and we are pleased to offer an expanding suite of offerings as we continue to drive millions of daily API transactions for tens of thousands of clients that are current users. And just this past week, we hosted our Annual ADP Marketplace Partner Summit, where we further strengthened our partner relations and provided actionable ideas to help our partners grow their business. Also earlier in Q1, we released our Return to Workplace solution that helps clients bring their employees back to work safely through a comprehensive set of tools designed to streamline and manage the process. We now have thousands of clients using the Return to Workplace solution, and we expect usage to grow over time as more clients start to gradually bring their employees back to the office or the work site. As I said, we are very pleased with the start of the year. And I'd like to recognize our associates from sales to service implementation and all the others who support them for their continued efforts in outstanding performance during this time. They continue to come through for our clients when it matters most. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kathleen.\nKathleen Winters: Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. We had a great Q1 with the combination of gradually improving macroeconomic conditions and outstanding execution, driving better sales retention and overall volume. We do expect to continue to face a number of headwinds over the course of fiscal 2021, as the global economy continues to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. But with our strong first quarter, we now see the potential for a better full year outcome compared to our outlook three months ago and our updated guidance reflects this view. For the first quarter, our revenue declined 1% on a reported and organic constant currency basis. Clearly a nice start out of the gate and better than we were expecting three months ago. Better bookings and retention rates were the main drivers of revenue favorability. And that coupled with expense favorability resulted in a year-over-year increase of 120 basis points in our adjusted EBIT margin. As you will recall, we anticipated that first quarter would have a modest acceleration in bookings compared to the previous quarter, but a greater year-over-year revenue decline than we experienced in the previous quarter. And that much of this loss revenue would be at very high margin. Instead, our booking swung to a year-over-year increase, revenues declined only modestly and our margins expanded even with the sales and implementation expense generated by a much stronger than expected bookings quarter. Several factors drove this margin favorability. First, with a more modest revenue decline than expected in Q1, we saw less associated margin pressure than expected. In addition, the better retention we had in Q1 also translated to lower bad debt expense than we had originally contemplated. We also continue to execute our downturn playbook with our entire organization carefully managing headcount and discretionary expenses. And lastly, we make great progress on our digital transformation and expanded procurement initiatives in Q1 and effectively reduced operating expenses and overhead faster than anticipated. We are encouraged by what we've seen so far and are making a modest increase in our expected full year cost benefit from these transformation initiatives. And now expect $150 million in benefit for fiscal 2021 up from $125 million. That revenue and margin performance together drove adjusted EBIT growth of 5%. Our adjusted effective tax rate increased 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to 21.3%, driven by lower tax benefit on excess stock sensation. Our share count was lower year-over-year driven by both share repurchases that took place pre-COVID as well as the resumption of buybacks during the quarter. All of this combined to drive 5% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share to $1.41, a great start to the year. Now, some detail on the segments. For ES, our revenues declined 3% on a reported basis and 3% on an organic constant currency basis. A great result considering this quarter included the effects of a 9% decline in pays per control and a 20% drop in client funds interest revenue, plus the impact from last quarter\u2019s lower booking level. Our client funds balances were down only 7% better than the double-digit decline expected. And that outperformance was driven by the same bookings and retention related factors that supported revenue. The year-over-year decline in average balances continued to be impacted by lower pays per control, lower state unemployment insurance rates, continued payroll tax deferrals amongst some of our clients and the closure of our Netherlands money movement operation in October of 2019. Our average yield for our client funds interest declined by 30 basis points about in line with our expectations in this low interest rate environment. Employer services margin was up 120 basis points for the quarter, well ahead of our most recent expectations, driven by the same factors I mentioned earlier when discussing consolidated results. For PEO also a strong quarter out of the gate, our total PEO segment revenues increased 4% for the quarter to $1.1 billion and average work-site employees declined only 3% to 547,000. This revenue growth and work site employee performance were both ahead of our expectations, driven primarily by better retention and stronger than expected bookings in Q1. Same-store employment at our PEO clients performed in line with our expectations for mid-single digit decline steady from last quarter. Revenues excluding zero margin benefits pass-throughs declined 1%, and in addition to being driven by lower WSEs, it continued to include pressure from lower workers' compensation and SUI costs and related pricing. PEO margin increased 40 basis points in the quarter. This included about a 60 basis points of favoribility from ADP Indemnity pertaining to changes in the actuarial loss estimates. Let me now turn to our updated guidance for fiscal 2021. We are very encouraged by our strong Q1 performance. We are still somewhat cautious about the balance of the year. You'll see that the implied increase in guidance for the next three quarters builds in some ongoing momentum for the balance of the year, but does not anticipate the same level of outperformance we just experienced in Q1. This reflects both our confidence in the fundamental strengths of ADP, as well as a realistic assessment of the lingering uncertainties ahead for the global economy, including uncertainty around the rate of continued economic improvement, the labor participation rate and the timeline for a vaccine. For the details of our outlook, I'll start by updating you on some of our key macroeconomic assumptions. For pays per control, we continue to expect a decline of 3% to 4% for the year. And as we mentioned, pays per control performed approximately in line with our expectations in Q1. We continue to assume a modest pace of improvement from this point, with mid-to-high single digit decline in Q2, improving to a mid-single digit decline in Q3, followed by a mid-to-high single digit increase in Q4 on the easier compare. And as you are aware, the reported BLS unemployment rate has trended better than most people's expectations these past few months. But factors like a reduced labor force participation rate are creating an offset, which is why our pays per control has actually been in line so far. Out-of-business losses outperformed our expectations and contributed to our record Q1 retention levels. We are raising our retention guidance accordingly. While we have seen effectively no incremental pressure so far this year from increased bankruptcies among our clients with continued uncertainty as to further stimulus and strain in parts of the economy remaining from partial shutdowns. We believe it is still prudent to assume some effect from higher out-of-business losses in the coming quarters. On client funds interest, there is no material change to our expectation for average interest rates for the year, though we are revising our balanced growth higher, given the better start to the year with stronger sales and retention. We continue to expect the client funds balances to return to year-over-year growth in Q4. Let's now look at a revised fiscal 2021 guidance. I'll start with ES. We now expect revenue to be flat to down 2% for the full year versus our previous expectation for a decline of 3% to 5%. I'll break that down into some of its components. We now expect our new business bookings to be up 10% to 20% compared to our prior forecast of flat to up 10%. That 10% increase in guidance reflects the impact of our Q1 outperformance, as well as a slight increase in our bookings expectation over the rest of the year. We are still contemplating a modest year-over-year bookings decline in Q2, as instances of partial economic lockdowns in Europe, plus uncertainty from the U.S. election keep us somewhat cautious, but this Q2 outlook is certainly better than what we contemplated three months ago. We now expect our ES retention to be flat to down 50 basis points, versus down 50 to 100 basis points previously. As again we had stronger Q1 retention than expected and believe our strong client satisfaction will translate to continued strong controllable retention, that we continue to assume elevated out-of-business losses in Q2 and Q3. And for our client funds interest, which primarily impacts the results of our ES segment, we are raising our average balances expectation on the strong Q1 sales and retention performance and accordingly raising our client funds interest range by $10 million, now to $400 million to $410 million. We now expect our margin in the Employer Services segment to be down 100 basis points to 150 basis points for the year versus our prior forecast of down 300 basis points, driven by the stronger Q1 performance, a stronger revenue outlook and continued expense discipline. For our PEO, we now expect revenue to be flat to up 3% versus our previous forecast of down 2% to up 2%. And we expect an average worksite employee count down 1% to up 1% versus our previous forecast of flat to down 3%. We continue to expect average work-site employee growth to be negative during the first three quarters and turn positive in Q4. Our revenues excluding zero-margin pass-throughs are expected to be down 1% to up 1% versus our previous forecast of down 4% to down 1%. We continue to expect lower workers' compensation and SUI revenues on a per work site employee basis. For PEO margin, we now expect to be down 50 basis points to flat in fiscal 2021, versus our prior forecast for down 100 basis points, this increase in our guidance is driven by stronger revenues and a more favorable benefit from ADP Indemnity. Moving to our consolidated outlook. We now anticipate total ADP revenue to be down 1% to up 1% in fiscal 2021, versus down 4% to down 1% prior. And we anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to be down 100 basis points to 150 basis points versus our prior guide of down 300 basis points. As I mentioned earlier, we now expect about $150 million in savings from the combination of our digital transformation, as well as our procurement transformation initiatives. And we will continue to manage our expense base prudently. As we saw in Q1, you should expect that further upside to our revenues, whether from macro-related factors or our own execution should drive upside to our margins as well. In August, we refinanced $1 billion of notes maturing in 2020. And as a result, we will benefit from approximately $5 million in interest expense savings this year. For our effective tax rate, we continue to anticipate 23.1% for the year. We resumed our share repurchases in Q1, and we assume a net share count reduction in our guidance. Net of all these changes, we are raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a decline of 3% to 7%, which represents a much more modest decline, compared to our prior guidance of down 13% to 18%. I'd like to wrap up with a few comments on longer-term margins. To be clear, there has been no departure from our focused and consistent approach to continue to drive margins higher over the long-term. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, a continued economic recovery should support employment growth and above normal pays per control growth. And we would expect such a trend to contribute incremental margin uplift to our results, all else being equal. The impact of lower interest rates will also begin to moderate in the coming years. In addition to these macroeconomic factors, we expect our underlying margin performance to continue to be supplemented by our ongoing efforts to transform our organization and client service operations and to be supported long-term by Next Gen platforms that are more efficient and less expensive to maintain. As you have seen from our Q1 results, we are committed to protecting and driving margins, even as we maintain our steady approach to investing for the long-term. We remain confident in our long-term growth prospects and our ability to execute. And I look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning and good to see the upgraded guidance. As we entered the critical year end selling season, I hear the caution around factors like partial lockdowns in Europe and the U.S. election. But can you give us some more detailed kind of insight around your expectations for new bookings potentially have RUN, Workforce Now, Vantage and our surveys of your customers pre-COVID, we were hearing a lot of demand for Workforce Now, especially into the bottom of the market up to 4,000 to 5,000 employees per company.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes. I mean, I think that we'd like to be \u2013 given the momentum we just demonstrated, we'd like to be really optimistic, unfortunately, we all watch the same news and the backdrop in terms of these issues, it's not just Europe, I think there are some concerns here in the U.S. as well. And what we saw from April \u2013 March, April May, is that we stick to our story that our clients \u2013 if our clients are hunkering down and are unable to make decisions, it impacts us. So we remain positive because it doesn't feel like there's going to be a full lockdown across the board nationally like there was here in the U.S. last time. And we've clearly adapted, I mean we've \u2013 you can see it in the quarter, how much progress we've made in terms of being able to sell virtually and use online tools and really ramp up our digital marketing and a lot of other things that we can talk about that we've done to adjust our salesforce. But for us to tell you what our view is of RUN and Workforce Now and enterprise sales in the next two or three months, honestly is difficult other than to stick to our story around our guidance, which is really more about the full year and couching it in optimistic, positive and good execution terms, but also with some level of caution, because we're still dependent, I think on the healthcare situation and to some extent on the economy as well. One of the questions that you're not \u2013 you didn't ask, but I'm sure people are wondering is about this \u2013 question is stimulus. And that's another one that I wish we could tell you that we have kind of a scientific placeholder in our forecast around how much stimulus and whether there is stimulus or not and we don't \u2013 but that's another factor that I think would just create the kind of overall picture that would either be supportive or not supportive of our sales efforts, because clearly if you look at the last 20, 30 years of ADP, there is some general correlation between GDP and our sales results, our new business bookings. And that is impacted by not just the economic activity related to the healthcare crisis but also to things like stimulus, because obviously the government can offset down pressure on the economy, through stimulus as it just did, but there is also uncertainty around that as well. So I wish I could give you a more concrete, one thing I can tell you for sure is we're maintaining our sales investment, we're maintaining our optimism and we are gradually getting some people back into the field in terms of selling. And we're certainly pivoting in a big way in terms of using the large resources we already had with inside sales to really train a lot of our traditional field sales to be able to sell virtually. And I think you saw a great execution and great results in the quarter as a result of that.\nKathleen Winters: I'd just add one other thought here or comment here. In addition to what Carlos said, I mean, look, obviously we're very encouraged and we're optimistic because of the great outperformance in Q1. But as you heard us say, we're very cautious because of the various uncertainties that we mentioned. But I would also say, we're cautious because as we look back in history and as we look at how in other recessions, how we recovered from that. We do see a period of chopping as it's not all kind of a straight line up in terms of the recovery during the great financial recession after that, we had I believe it was six quarters of negative sales growth after that and it was quite choppy actually. So we're expecting there to be some choppiness here as well. So I just wanted you to be aware of that.\nDavid Togut: Understood. As a follow-up, how do you see the current economic environment affecting the case for outsourcing of payroll and HR services? In other words do the economic challenges that businesses face make them want to focus more on their core business and outsource payroll and HR services?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes. I mean, I think that's safe to assume that we would probably be on the side of the ledger of businesses that would benefit \u201cunder normal circumstances post pandemic\u201d. So in other words, once we get through the transitory nature of the challenge, I don't see how it's not a positive backdrop for companies like ADP and outsourcers who help people, first of all, maintain business continuity, and second of all, focus on their core business as you imply. So I think it has to \u2013 again, but we have \u2013 what do we \u2013 how many points of growth is that, only history will tell, but we think it will \u2013 we think it\u2019ll be a positive.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Wow, the recovery in bookings is pretty fantastic. I know you provided a little color around using your inside sales to train your outside sales. Can you just even provide a little, like, what is your sales model looking like right now? To what extent are you using kind of digital marketing and digital onboarding? Can you just give a little bit more color around kind of what happened and what changed over the course of the three months to drive that recovery?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Sure. I'm not sure that the call is long enough though to be able to give you all that, because one of the differences between us and some of our competitors, which I would see it as a positive, if I were all of you, is that we're very diversified both geographically and also across segments. So the answer unfortunately is complicated and it goes area-by-area. So in international for example, we're very happy with very strong results versus expectation, but also frankly, very strong results versus the prior year. But there were a few larger deals there, I think there were few global view deals that helped. And when you look at the core best of breed, like in-country solutions, we also outperform there versus expectations, but not as well in terms of versus the prior year, which is obviously understandable given the pandemic. So that's international. And then you move to the U.S. and the story in a downmarket is different and the midmarket is different than the upmarket. Although across the board, we were better than expected. But the growth year-over-year varied, because I think that's the biggest surprise, which we're frankly very excited about is that we have positive growth. But if you decompose it, it's a different story in each area. And we had tailwinds in the downmarket, I think as result of some big recovery that was probably some pent up demand, the PPP loans probably frankly saved a lot of small businesses and provided a lot of cash to small businesses to continue to kind of run their businesses and make decisions around purchasing solutions like what we provide to help them run their business better. So it really \u2013 by the way, our upmarket was also good and strong. So that was very encouraging the midmarket I think performed also better than our expectations. So I wish I could give you a simple answer. I personally see it as a positive, because if it was one thing that we could point to, I think it would be problematic because that could easily change overnight, but there really isn't, it's just a lot of execution across the board. I do think that we got a little bit of help, again, we don't have a scientific way of estimating it, but I've been consistent in the nine years that I've been in this job, because of knowing our culture and how we operate, the fact that our fiscal year ended where it did, we clearly had a little bit of pent up demand from call it May, June that carried over into July. I would say that, that was somewhat minor in this case, because getting companies to make decisions on your timeline is probably not as easy to do now as it has been in prior years. But historically when we have a bad year, we get off to a good start. And in some segments that didn't affect probably international business, didn't affect the downmarket, because the downmarket doesn't really have that ability to kind of hold off on something and started in the next fiscal year. But may have had a little bit of an impact. But we're pretty convinced that that's not a major story, but I thought I was important for me to be consistent, because I've been saying that for nine years, by the way, likewise, we have a blowout fourth quarter, we end up usually struggling at the beginning of the next fiscal year.\nLisa Ellis: Okay. And then for my follow-up, I know you called out the payroll engine and adding 100 additional clients this quarter. Can you just remind us or update us on sort of where you are in that overall rollout and what the kind of rate and pace of that is?\nCarlos Rodriguez: So I think we have a total of a couple 100 clients, and I would describe that as still are very early compared to ADP\u2019s size. So if we were a startup, you'd be really excited. And I think we have a $20 billion market cap right now with only 200 clients, given what I've been seeing in the market. But the reality is that relative to ADP size and given our profile as a company and so forth, you got to take it in context, but we can't help, but be excited, because two years, three years, five years, 10 years down the road, it's going to be a big difference maker. I think it is, and that was our plan, when we built the business case, we've been at it for three or four years, this is a global scalable new payroll engine, it's incredibly exciting in terms of what it's going to do in terms of feature functionality, and hopefully client satisfaction, but also cost to maintain, cost to develop. But as you know, we have approximately 800,000 clients, sorry, 900,000, that's not fair because RUN, this has nothing to do with RUN. But a large portion of ADP's business is still on our current versions of our payroll engine, which by the way, all of these payroll engines are transparent to the clients. I don't know if any of you guys understand that, but Workforce Now and Vantage and Lithion, and all of our products are the front ends are really what our clients experience. And it's just important to remember that this is not like the transitions we had with Workforce Now, or even with RUN, because this is a gross to net engine that is really kind of underneath the hood, if you will of what the clients are experiencing on the front end. So that's positive too, because we don't anticipate a major migration effort, if you will, when we get to that, which is still at some point in the future.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thank you. Nice job.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-tsin Huang: Thanks so much. Good morning, really terrific new sales results. Just to add to what Lisa asked at the beginning there, just thinking about ROI on your sales investments. Did you lean in really hard in this quarter there, and I'm sure everyone was motivated to drive sales, but could we see more return on some incremental investments as you go throughout the fiscal year? I was trying to understand the timing of some of the investments you put in place, and also if there is any call-outs on pricing on new deals, especially on the enterprise side.\nKathleen Winters: Yes. So on the sales investment, what I would say is maybe think about two big buckets in terms of investment from a headcount perspective and continuing to invest in marketing and digital marketing. The headcount investment, we kind of try to do that on a very steady pace over time, and that's been consistent with how we've thought about it and approached it. It was somewhat modest headcount investment in Q1 and that will ramp up during the course of the year, we're planning to continue to focus on and do that. And for sure have committed funding and resources, if you will from a digital marketing perspective to help support the bookings.\nTien-tsin Huang: Terrific. And then on pricing, anything \u2013 any call outs there?\nCarlos Rodriguez: No. It's really \u2013 we really don't see any \u2013 I'm sure I know we did and I think some of our competitors did things to try to help our clients. And even in some cases prospects like there was a couple of examples of people giving away like three free months. And I think one competitor was doing six free months, et cetera. But \u2013 and one competitor changed their pricing online, but then changed to back a couple months later. So I would say there is nothing to report. There is really very little change in the pricing environment. This is not \u2013 I don't think this is really a question of pricing. I don't think you can impact end demand in a significant way in this environment through that, that would not be \u2013 certainly would be our view, that\u2019s not how to drive growth.\nTien-tsin Huang: Great to hear. Just my quick follow-up, just on PEO and sort of the sales outlook there, given some of the same caution and uncertainty with the election and maybe insurance. Do you \u2013 are you more bullish or less bullish on PEO here as we go into the second quarter here versus 90 days ago?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I'm always bullish on the PEO. I was born in the PEO. And as you know, so the \u2013 I think the \u2013 as usual my answer has to be, if you look at the short-term, we have a lot of pressure in some parts of our business because of the healthcare situation. And the question is, do you want to look through that or do you want to stay focused on us, for example, in the PEO when you have clients shrinking, we from a discipline standpoint have some rules around that can sometimes affect \u2013 create adjustments, if you will, in our sales results, it puts pressure in the short-term on the sales results i.e., call it audits if you will. So if a client was sold and was valued at $1,000 and 12 months later, they're now valued at $900 because they're paying fewer people than we're collecting less revenue, which as you can imagine is happening with the majority of our clients that affects our PEO sales results. So I\u2019d say that the fact that workers\u2019 compensation, prices and costs have come down, which is part of the revenue picture, there is a lot of short-term transitory things. But I would say on a unit basis, our results were very good in the quarter. And we\u2019re very happy with that. And I would say that again, if there is any businesses that are going to be even more from a pure positioning standpoint, stronger coming out of the pandemic, the comprehensive outsourcing businesses, which PEO is one of them should be very compelling value propositions, because, as people look back a year or two from now, they might be thinking, I really don't want to go through that again. I don't want to be figuring out how to process, forget about payroll, because that \u2013 we have that covered. But most people \u2013 a lot of our clients do not use us for health benefits, processing or management of open enrollment, they don't use us for time and attendance, they don't use us for workers' compensation and our comprehensive solutions take care of the entire picture. And I think if you're a small and mid-sized business, if I were you, I'd be thinking about making that change, maybe not right now, because you've got other things that you're focused on, but I think six to 12 months from now, I would expect people to be seriously considering any options they have to deal with multiple things that are very critical to the ongoing operations and to their employees, but they may not have thought of pre-pandemic.\nTien-tsin Huang: Got it. I was going to get you on the phone and start selling them. Thank you for that update.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMihir Bhatia: Hi, this is Mihir on the Jason. Thank you for taking our questions. Maybe I can just follow-up a little bit on bookings. If you could maybe just talk a little bit about trends you saw in a F1Q and what you're seeing even now, I guess, between small, medium and large. Anything different worth calling out that we should be considering? And then just relatedly on booking. Was there any negative booking adjustment in the F1Q booking numbers?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I'm sorry, negative adjustment in which Q?\nMihir Bhatia: In the booking number this quarter \u2013 like in terms of booking number this quarter?\nCarlos Rodriguez: No. We had a minor \u2013 I would say we had a minor, we talked about last quarter that we had taken some reserves because we expected to have \u2013 obviously clients that were going to cancel their orders and so forth to abuse laypersons terms. And I think that's exactly what happened. And I think our \u2013 we did reverse some of that reserve, but it was actually very much in line with the actual client. We had identified, we didn't do this kind of at a very high level. We had specific clients when we booked that reserve in our \u201cbookings\u201d, we had identified a list of clients that we thought were probably going to cancel in this first quarter. And I believe the two things\u2026\nKathleen Winters: Yes, and so we utilized \u2013 we basically utilized a portion of that reserve, which is a normal course of how it happens. I guess Q4 was just an outsized amount for that, we call it the backlog adjustment. It's just outside obviously because of the COVID impact and a portion of that was utilized in Q1, but nothing significant other than that.\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think it's safe to say it would not have made a difference. I mean, it clearly would've made a difference if we hadn't had the \u2013 but if you want to know what our gross bookings performance was, it was not affected by our gross bookings performance, it did not affect our gross bookings performance. You would have had basically the same picture.\nMihir Bhatia: Understood. And then just any trends between, just small, medium or large businesses, what you were seeing this quarter?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Other than noise, I think we \u2013 probably the strongest performance was in the downmarket because much to everyone's surprise, there is strong business formation. And we saw that as kind of \u2013 we talked about that in our last call, remarkable recovery in small business very quickly at the beginning of the pandemic, both in terms of pace for control in kind of all categories, including this kind of new business formation. And I would probably add a note of caution there that to me is counterintuitive, and whenever in my career I've seen something that doesn't make sense, it generally \u2013 I think there is probably a little bit of payback at some point, I'm hoping I'm wrong, because if there is a relatively quick solution to the healthcare crisis, it's possible if the government managed to get small business through this relatively unscathed through PPP and all the other things that they've done. But in general it's a counterintuitive kind of situation. But we'll take it, it was positive.\nKathleen Winters: Yes. The other areas where we saw some particular strengths, and I think we mentioned already on the international side, particularly Canada was very strong for the quarter and also our compliance services area. So things like employment verification, unemployment claims, things like add more compliance of services related stuff saw a very strong performance in the quarter.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, it\u2019s a great point. Like we don't always talk about some of these businesses that we have that are very good businesses, we call them standalone businesses. And we did have some good tailwinds from some of those businesses quarter. But again, I would tell you that they don't change the overall picture, but important to note that those were helpful.\nMihir Bhatia: Understood. And then just, if I could follow-up real quick on your EBIT margin guidance, you had a pretty nice raise in the guidance. And I was just wondering how much of that is driven by the stronger top line outlook versus changes in your expectations by expenses. I know you mentioned an extra $25 million in transformation savings, but were there other factors because it doesn't look like, it's just float income didn\u2019t change all that much. So anything else if you could give us there? Thank you.\nCarlos Rodriguez: I would say it's safe to assume that most of it is as a result of that. But that I don't want to take away from us in terms of our execution, because, if we have higher revenue, we also frankly have more clients more employees to pay. So to the extent that we believe we can hold the line on expenses, some companies, you have to cut expenses, in our case, we just have to hold the line and that's probably good news, but I would say that mathematically you're on the right track, which is \u2013 that's a big factor. The incremental revenue is \u2013 a lot of it is flowing to the bottom line and helping our margins.\nKathleen Winters: Yes, definitely that incremental high margin revenue is the biggest contributor, but also, as we said look, we've been really focused on making sure we're doing a good job on cost control. We're keeping a close watch on headcount. We talked about investment in sales, but other than sales we're really controlling everywhere else from a headcount perspective. Very tight on discretionary costs, transformation work is coming along very nicely. We did a little bit better with the higher retention, better on bad debt expense in Q1. We think we're cautious about that because we think it could come and hit us in Q2 and Q3. So we've built that into our expectation. But those were the contributors.\nMihir Bhatia: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the contribution to bookings performance of delayed, kind of bookings getting realized this quarter versus sort of net new bookings. I'm just trying to understand the contribution from maybe sort of a backlog of delayed bookings and how material that was. And then also to just understand what it is, sort of a pipeline of these delays that should flow in, kind of continue to flow in as we get a little deeper into the year or was there more of sort of a one-time catch-up that happened in the quarter with some of these delayed deals, does that makes sense?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I\u2019d say the only place where it's really meaningful and quantifiable is probably in the international space where we had, I think I mentioned a few global view deals that were delayed if you will, but that's actually not a \u2013 I wouldn't call it, that's not something that was in the \u2013 necessarily in the backlog because we hadn't sold it yet. So we don't actually book a sale until it doesn't go into the backlog until we get a contract. And so these were things that were in process, if you will, or in the sales process. And maybe we thought it was going to close in May or June, but by the way, maybe it wouldn't have \u2013 even without a pandemic, like there's really no way to, this is all frankly speculation stuff that we do when we get into these kinds of conversations. But I say that's the place where a field like we had a few large deals that we thought were going to close in the fourth quarter and didn't, by the way, client decisions, not us trying to move them from one quarter to the other. We want to get businesses as fast as we can. So we are always trying to book everything as quickly as we can, but some client delays in the international space, it's really not honestly a factor in the downmarket and very small factor in the mid-market in terms of controllability. We can't really sway our clients that easily from one way to the other. Maybe a little bit of that in the upmarket and in international, but you really can't do that in a downmarket and the mid-market. So I would say, there's a difference between, I guess I'm not sure what the nature of the question is, but I think I already said that there could have been some \u2013 in some segments of our sales force, if you have a terrible year and you're in the last month and you're not going to make the year, there's sometimes the tendency for people to hold and start that business in July. But I think you saw in our comments that August and September were also strong. So it doesn't feel like \u2013 people don't like hold something from May and June, and then book it at the last day of September. They typically put it in the first week of July. And so again, based on my experience and what I've seen here over the years, there was probably a little bit of that didn't make a material difference in the sales results. And it is where it is. We had a great start and I think great execution. And besides us leaning into our sales investments, the really big difference maker here is our sales force leaned in to drive results, right. And we're incredibly grateful to them for that.\nRamsey El-Assal: All right, that helps a lot. I appreciate it. And just a quick follow-up on the \u2013 if you could give us an update on the rollout of the Next Gen HCM and the Payroll engines relative to, let's say three months ago or four months ago, how do you think COVID is going to impact the roll out of some of the Next Gen technologies? Is it going to be \u2013 you mentioned some delays, I think previously, but how is it looking now?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, we had \u2013 I think we had a good quarter like \u2013 frankly, if any client to me is a good point. It's good news. And I think we had three or four. I think Danny probably\u2026\nKathleen Winters: That\u2019s right. Yes, we had a couple of them, good sales.\nCarlos Rodriguez: We had some sales like closed. In other words, we got people to sign contracts in the quarter. Like, I don't know about anybody else, but I'm not spending a lot of contracts in this kind of environment. Like we just \u2013 the whole focus of this call is how we're focused on prudent expense management and trying to keep expenses down. So when people are coming to me, selling me things, I'm generally not a big signer on those types of things. So just shows, I think the value of \u2013 of our value proposition that people are still signing up because I think they believe that it will not only help them in the short-term, but that perhaps it can make them more efficient even in the short-term. So I think that is a good sign, right, of the strength of our products and the solutions and the pitch that we have. But that was good news. I mean, we were pleasantly surprised.\nKathleen Winters: And we have several dozen, I think in implementation, active implementations right now. So the sales are continuing, the backlog, the implementations continued to scale up. So really no significant or substantial change in the outlook.\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think besides the sales, we actually started, I think a number of clients, three or four also.\nDanyal Hussain: Yes. We're in the double-digits now.\nCarlos Rodriguez: These are clients \u2013 we actually sold new clients, new contract that are now going to go into the implementation process, but we had clients that were in the implementation process, a few of which delayed starting in the fourth quarter, but then we started them here in the first quarter. So I would say that's all the news. And on Next Gen Payroll, you heard what we said and sold 100, which again, I think is pretty damn good news, like in this kind of environment.\nRamsey El-Assal: Agreed. I appreciate your answers. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Wald from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSteven Wald: Great. Thank you. Good morning. So I'd love to come back to the margin. I know some be in over the head, but maybe just a couple of other sort of ways to look at it. It seems like the way you're all looking at it going forward is, if macro cooperates in the higher margin pieces of the revenue could drop to the bottom line and drive incremental upside from here. Is that the right way to think about it? And generally, should we assume that implicit in the remaining three quarters of the year, the lower margin implicit assumption for at least a couple of those quarters is really more dependent on the macro than it is on your piece of investment, which I think we maybe collectively thought was going to be more robust than the headwind relative to what it ended up being this quarter?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Okay. So just to clarify, remember we outperformed not because we stopped investing or didn't invest as much as we said we were going to invest is because we outperformed on the top line, right. In terms of our revenue, even though some of it was clearly expense management and so forth. But I would say that the answer to that question is that, it's hard to wrap your head around our economic. I know it's hard because most companies don't operate this way, but for example, the better things get in terms of the macroeconomic, the more we're going to invest. And I know that's not going to make some people happy, but like for example, our fourth quarter, like our fourth quarter, like if things play out the way we planned in terms of the original guidances and we're not changing anything on you, but like our fourth quarter where we have easier comps, we would also expect to have great sales results, right. And those great sales results on a comp basis will also bring with them sales expense. And to the extent, we can get some of these clients started and our sales results improved, we're going to start also investing more and stepping on the accelerator and implementation expenses. So this is all carefully planned, carefully controlled as Kathleen was alluding to, like, this is not some kind of free-for-all in terms of expenses, but this is an amazing economic model. I don't know if you can see what we just delivered and what we're telling you that assuming that the situation cooperates with us, we probably will be either flat to slightly up in terms of revenue for the year. So that would mean that, we'll continue our streak of ADP of never being negative revenue growth, which is pretty remarkable, right. We had a massive decline in volume in the last quarter, massive declines in new business bookings. And you see now granted, this is not what we are targeting like, we'd like to have high single-digit revenue growth. So it's kind of weird that we're excited about flat, but it's all about the context and it's all about relativity. So it's really a great economic model, but the economic model is a long-term economic model. You have to invest in sales, implementation, and product to drive the results. This is not \u2013 we're not running the business quarter-to-quarter. And what that means is the minute we see the sunshine \u2013 the sun shining we're going to become boasted. It doesn't mean that our expenses are going to get out of control, but you will see our sales and our implementation expenses gradually come up. And along with that, some point our service expenses as well. But that's great because the most important driver of long-term value of this company is growth. It's not what the margin in next quarter or this year. \nSteven Wald: I understood. Sorry.\nKathleen Winters: Yes, just some more color from my perspective. I mean, I would just say, look, we continue to be, as we always have been very, very focused on growth and efficiency and becoming more and more efficient every day. So we're going to continue to invest where it makes sense for growth and for efficiency. So we talked about sales headcount and continuing to support that investment, investment in product. And we invest in efficiency, all of the digital work that we're doing isn't, it doesn't come for free. You have to make investments to be able to drive that efficiency improvement. So we're focused on all of that and we're going to continue to do that.\nDanyal Hussain: And Steve, just one last thing to tie it back to our guidance. You're right. Certain macro factors will have an outsized impact for the next two quarters. And so what we've contemplated is pressure in retention and pays per control, both of which come at high incremental margins. If ultimately those come out better than forecasted, as you suggest, they would represent upside to margin.\nCarlos Rodriguez: There's a few others, like Kathleen mentioned bad debt expense is also something that, frankly has been shocking in the last six months where we've had, honestly like decreases in our bad debt expense, which makes no sense at all. So hopefully that will continue, but we didn't plan for that. I think we didn't roll forward three quarters of lower bad debt expense.\nSteven Wald: Right. Okay. That's all very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe as my follow up there, I think it was asked a little bit before, but Carlos, you were just talking about it a little bit ago there of just kind of wanting to grow mid to high single-digits. If we rewind the tape back to January and you guys talked about the markets you were in and how you were growing, sort of seemed like the way to think about it was you were generally growing in line with the market. And I think your earlier comments indicated, next few years should be an uptick, but there's going to be choppiness of course. I guess I'm curious how you guys think of ADP's positioning relative to other platforms. And obviously, you had a really strong quarter. But for the last several years, you've seen a lot of other platforms growing, in excess off of much lower basis. I'm just curious how you think about it today versus six months ago versus a year ago. If we are to see this uptick in HCM demand and outsourcing demand, where you feel about ADP's positioning in that market?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, I would answer that question just by saying that we just invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new platforms in our key markets, because we intend to take market share.\nSteven Wald: Couldn't be clearer than that. Okay, I'll leave it there. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks. Hey Kathleen, you talked about kind of out-of-business and the guidance looks like it calls for kind of elevated losses in Q2 and Q3. Did it bottom in Q1 and gets better? And then I guess just along those same lines, can you talk about, is there a way to also frame clients that are maybe still in business, but not processing at this point? So I guess, two different questions, just trying to get a sense of a, where the out-of-business did it bottom Q1 and then improves in Q2, Q3, and then as your way to frame no clients still in business that maybe aren't processing at this point?\nKathleen Winters: Yes. So on the first thing, the out-of-business, I would not say it bottomed at all. In fact, we did not see a significant impact from out-of-business in Q1. I think the shoe has yet to drop there is how I would say it. And that's what we are forecasting and guiding that we're going to see some pressure from that in Q2 and Q3. That come in Q2, is there more stimulus that helps support it and we don't see it in Q2 and maybe it doesn't come till Q3, I don't know, but we're planning, I think we're cautious about it. And we're planning to see that pressure in Q3 \u2013 Q2 and Q3, sorry.\nCarlos Rodriguez: And on your question about clients not processing, we did mention that a number of small businesses restarted in the first quarter but there is still a sizeable chunk of companies that have gone inactive and remain in that state.\nDanyal Hussain: And to be clear, there's just \u2013 in case there's a misunderstanding there that doesn't have \u2013 it has nothing to do with our business bookings, right. So that affects our revenue and affects our losses to some extent, but this is unrelated to business bookings. Because the word restart might confuse some people.\nKathleen Winters: Yes, so higher than it would be in a normal period. It's come down from where it was at the peak in probably April, May, June, it's come down from there, but it's still higher than normal situation.\nKevin McVeigh: Got it. And just to wrap that point, Carlos, it's fair to say that, with the stimulus, it probably helped those inactives a little bit that maybe would have fallen into bankruptcy. Is that a fair way to think about it too?\nCarlos Rodriguez: No question about it.\nKevin McVeigh: Cool. And then just real quick, it looks like the midpoint of the revenue guidance for ES is a 300 basis point improvement versus 150 basis point improvement for the PEO, any puts and takes to \u2013 I know it's not one-to-one but is it just kind of the client mix that where you'd seen a little bit more upside on ES as opposed to PEO or just any thoughts around that?\nCarlos Rodriguez: No. Other than \u2013 that's actually a great question, which we'll go back now and decompose that because we hadn't looked at it that way. At least, I hadn't. But I would say, my instinct would tell me that has more to do with how the operating plan is built than any macroeconomic or other major explanation. So I honestly, I wouldn't read much into that.\nKevin McVeigh: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And we'll take our last question from Mark Marcon from Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking my question. Just with regards to the bookings performance this quarter. To what extent, do you think it was due to the sales force basically recalibrating and being able to get out and getting more at bats, relative to higher batting average. So, in terms of thinking about the win rates, and then I have a follow-up with regards to Next Gen.\nCarlos Rodriguez: That's a great question. And I have some sense of that from looking at the data right from the quarter. And I would say that our win rates are in line, I think a little bit better in some cases against a few competitors, which makes us very happy. But I would say, there's not a lot to report there that is, I think good news, but consistent if you will, in general. So it's probably more the former, right, which is the at-bats. And you could almost use the \u2013 what I call it, the traffic analogy, right. So ever since the pandemic started, whenever I go out on the roads, I do the traffic check and traffic is much higher and has been much higher over the last two or three months than it was in March and April. And that probably has something to do with, talking to just people on the streets, but people on the streets turn into people buying things and people going to restaurants and people going back to their workplaces and so forth. So I hate to be so crass and so simplistic, but I think that ADP is a very large company, which we're very proud of. And the gravitational pull of GDP and economic activity is strong in both directions. And I think we benefited a lot from, I think it's safe to say better than most people. I mean, I think this is not an ADP issue. I think most economists have raised their expectations about GDP. Unemployment is lower than everyone thought, even though labor force participation is lower. In general, things are better than people thought they were going to be and call it, May, June at this point. And we have benefited from that. I think that's I wish I could take more credit and give you a more complicated answer, but I think that is actually what's happening. The traffic is up for sure.\nMark Marcon: Great. And then just a short-term and a long-term question, but the short-term one is basically just as we're here in the key fall selling season, how do you view, Carlos, the kind of the mixed dynamics with regards to, hey, there's more uncertainty there's \u2013 this resurgence with regards to COVID, there's the election, perhaps not a lack of stimulus, but at the same time, things are more complicated. HR is more central. How does that end up impacting kind of the new sales, the bookings expectation, just here in the core selling season. And then the longer term question is Next Gen Payroll, Lifion, they've gotten really nice awards. You've obviously been inhibited by the pandemic in terms of being able to go out there and talk about it with clients. But when things get a little bit back to normal, how would you expect the penetration of those elements to go over the next year, two years, three years? Like when would we see a bigger penetration? So as they've gotten really good rewards.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, I think on the first part of your question, it's of course \u2013 the last question, of course, has to be the downer question, because I think that that's a hard one for me to, I've been so optimistic the whole call, so I hate to like bring us all down. But based on what I'm seeing right now, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And the fact that this is our key selling season, I wish I could tell you that I'm incredibly excited and bullish and so forth. I just want to get through this damn thing, right. And get out to the other side. And I'm looking forward more to the third and fourth quarter and the fourth quarter and the next fiscal year than I am to the next two or three months, because the combination of the election with, I mean, you guys all see the same thing that we're seeing. And again, got to apply the test of common sense and the test of common sense would tell me that this is a, let's just try to keep us up beat, let's just call it a fluid situation.\nKathleen Winters: It's going to be choppy, right. I mean, we thought we'll cover it from the last recession that it was choppy. And I'm fully expecting it's going to be choppy this time around too, particularly right, we're in Q2. We're in the fall, going into the winter, it's cold, we've got areas where there's resurgences that people might be hunkering down again. So Q2 might be challenging, but even in normal situations, normal years, right. Bookings are going to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. I'd focus more on the full year, the annual and the longer term view.\nCarlos Rodriguez: And again, of course, we also thought that the first quarter was going to be terrible and it turned out to be home run. So they easily go the other way, but I'm a man, I\u2019m like, I speak the truth, right. In terms of what I know and what I think at the time. And I spoke the truth in our last earnings call, and obviously I was wrong because things turned out to be much better. And I hope that happens here again, but that's my story. And I'm sticking to it, but one quarter or two quarters or three, it's not going to make a difference in ADP's long-term trajectory. What matters is the second part of your question, which is what do we intend to do? And what do we expect in terms of penetration rates and rollout of kind of our Next Gen platforms. And by the way, it's not just about Next Gen, I hope you guys understand that we are making some fairly sizeable investments, ongoing investments in Workforce Now. Workforce Now, now we have a version, if you will, I shouldn't call it a version, but Workforce Now is also on AWS in the cloud. So we've completely rebuilt Workforce Now to be as modern and as Next Gen, as Lifion and as our Next Gen Payroll engine. We also have been doing an enormous amount of work on RUN in the same vein, both at the guts of it in terms of the technology stack, but also on the user experience. You know what the investments we made in data cloud, you know, what we have with ADP marketplace, so this isn't an across the board increase in investment over methodically over the last six to seven years that I just summarize it by saying what I said once before, our intention is to have all of these things parlayed into taking market share and growing ADP faster than market and faster than the economy.\nMark Marcon: That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today's call. I\u2019m pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, thank you all of you for listening. Again, in summary, I just want to, once again, I think compliment our associates and our leadership team for incredible execution in the short-term, but I hope you also heard our commitment to the long-term in both in terms of sales, R&D, client service and all the things that drive growth and long-term value for our shareholders. And hopefully, for all of you who represent them. We remain committed to expense management, the digital transformation, all the things that Kathleen said, but we are somewhat holds into obviously the circumstances around the economy and the healthcare crisis. But we remain optimistic that this is \u2013 and it's the reason for optimism, and this is a transitory situation that we're going to get through it, hopefully in the next three or six months to the point where things gradually start to get back to normal. And then ADP can get back to the normal growth rates that we're used to. So thank you again and appreciate, you\u2019re supporting, you're listening to us. And I hope that all of you continue to stay healthy and safe. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Kathleen Winters",
            "content": "Thank you, Carlos, and good morning, everyone. We had a great Q1 with the combination of gradually improving macroeconomic conditions and outstanding execution, driving better sales retention and overall volume. We do expect to continue to face a number of headwinds over the course of fiscal 2021, as the global economy continues to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. But with our strong first quarter, we now see the potential for a better full year outcome compared to our outlook three months ago and our updated guidance reflects this view. For the first quarter, our revenue declined 1% on a reported and organic constant currency basis. Clearly a nice start out of the gate and better than we were expecting three months ago. Better bookings and retention rates were the main drivers of revenue favorability. And that coupled with expense favorability resulted in a year-over-year increase of 120 basis points in our adjusted EBIT margin. As you will recall, we anticipated that first quarter would have a modest acceleration in bookings compared to the previous quarter, but a greater year-over-year revenue decline than we experienced in the previous quarter. And that much of this loss revenue would be at very high margin. Instead, our booking swung to a year-over-year increase, revenues declined only modestly and our margins expanded even with the sales and implementation expense generated by a much stronger than expected bookings quarter. Several factors drove this margin favorability. First, with a more modest revenue decline than expected in Q1, we saw less associated margin pressure than expected. In addition, the better retention we had in Q1 also translated to lower bad debt expense than we had originally contemplated. We also continue to execute our downturn playbook with our entire organization carefully managing headcount and discretionary expenses. And lastly, we make great progress on our digital transformation and expanded procurement initiatives in Q1 and effectively reduced operating expenses and overhead faster than anticipated. We are encouraged by what we've seen so far and are making a modest increase in our expected full year cost benefit from these transformation initiatives. And now expect $150 million in benefit for fiscal 2021 up from $125 million. That revenue and margin performance together drove adjusted EBIT growth of 5%. Our adjusted effective tax rate increased 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2020 to 21.3%, driven by lower tax benefit on excess stock sensation. Our share count was lower year-over-year driven by both share repurchases that took place pre-COVID as well as the resumption of buybacks during the quarter. All of this combined to drive 5% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share to $1.41, a great start to the year. Now, some detail on the segments. For ES, our revenues declined 3% on a reported basis and 3% on an organic constant currency basis. A great result considering this quarter included the effects of a 9% decline in pays per control and a 20% drop in client funds interest revenue, plus the impact from last quarter\u2019s lower booking level. Our client funds balances were down only 7% better than the double-digit decline expected. And that outperformance was driven by the same bookings and retention related factors that supported revenue. The year-over-year decline in average balances continued to be impacted by lower pays per control, lower state unemployment insurance rates, continued payroll tax deferrals amongst some of our clients and the closure of our Netherlands money movement operation in October of 2019. Our average yield for our client funds interest declined by 30 basis points about in line with our expectations in this low interest rate environment. Employer services margin was up 120 basis points for the quarter, well ahead of our most recent expectations, driven by the same factors I mentioned earlier when discussing consolidated results. For PEO also a strong quarter out of the gate, our total PEO segment revenues increased 4% for the quarter to $1.1 billion and average work-site employees declined only 3% to 547,000. This revenue growth and work site employee performance were both ahead of our expectations, driven primarily by better retention and stronger than expected bookings in Q1. Same-store employment at our PEO clients performed in line with our expectations for mid-single digit decline steady from last quarter. Revenues excluding zero margin benefits pass-throughs declined 1%, and in addition to being driven by lower WSEs, it continued to include pressure from lower workers' compensation and SUI costs and related pricing. PEO margin increased 40 basis points in the quarter. This included about a 60 basis points of favoribility from ADP Indemnity pertaining to changes in the actuarial loss estimates. Let me now turn to our updated guidance for fiscal 2021. We are very encouraged by our strong Q1 performance. We are still somewhat cautious about the balance of the year. You'll see that the implied increase in guidance for the next three quarters builds in some ongoing momentum for the balance of the year, but does not anticipate the same level of outperformance we just experienced in Q1. This reflects both our confidence in the fundamental strengths of ADP, as well as a realistic assessment of the lingering uncertainties ahead for the global economy, including uncertainty around the rate of continued economic improvement, the labor participation rate and the timeline for a vaccine. For the details of our outlook, I'll start by updating you on some of our key macroeconomic assumptions. For pays per control, we continue to expect a decline of 3% to 4% for the year. And as we mentioned, pays per control performed approximately in line with our expectations in Q1. We continue to assume a modest pace of improvement from this point, with mid-to-high single digit decline in Q2, improving to a mid-single digit decline in Q3, followed by a mid-to-high single digit increase in Q4 on the easier compare. And as you are aware, the reported BLS unemployment rate has trended better than most people's expectations these past few months. But factors like a reduced labor force participation rate are creating an offset, which is why our pays per control has actually been in line so far. Out-of-business losses outperformed our expectations and contributed to our record Q1 retention levels. We are raising our retention guidance accordingly. While we have seen effectively no incremental pressure so far this year from increased bankruptcies among our clients with continued uncertainty as to further stimulus and strain in parts of the economy remaining from partial shutdowns. We believe it is still prudent to assume some effect from higher out-of-business losses in the coming quarters. On client funds interest, there is no material change to our expectation for average interest rates for the year, though we are revising our balanced growth higher, given the better start to the year with stronger sales and retention. We continue to expect the client funds balances to return to year-over-year growth in Q4. Let's now look at a revised fiscal 2021 guidance. I'll start with ES. We now expect revenue to be flat to down 2% for the full year versus our previous expectation for a decline of 3% to 5%. I'll break that down into some of its components. We now expect our new business bookings to be up 10% to 20% compared to our prior forecast of flat to up 10%. That 10% increase in guidance reflects the impact of our Q1 outperformance, as well as a slight increase in our bookings expectation over the rest of the year. We are still contemplating a modest year-over-year bookings decline in Q2, as instances of partial economic lockdowns in Europe, plus uncertainty from the U.S. election keep us somewhat cautious, but this Q2 outlook is certainly better than what we contemplated three months ago. We now expect our ES retention to be flat to down 50 basis points, versus down 50 to 100 basis points previously. As again we had stronger Q1 retention than expected and believe our strong client satisfaction will translate to continued strong controllable retention, that we continue to assume elevated out-of-business losses in Q2 and Q3. And for our client funds interest, which primarily impacts the results of our ES segment, we are raising our average balances expectation on the strong Q1 sales and retention performance and accordingly raising our client funds interest range by $10 million, now to $400 million to $410 million. We now expect our margin in the Employer Services segment to be down 100 basis points to 150 basis points for the year versus our prior forecast of down 300 basis points, driven by the stronger Q1 performance, a stronger revenue outlook and continued expense discipline. For our PEO, we now expect revenue to be flat to up 3% versus our previous forecast of down 2% to up 2%. And we expect an average worksite employee count down 1% to up 1% versus our previous forecast of flat to down 3%. We continue to expect average work-site employee growth to be negative during the first three quarters and turn positive in Q4. Our revenues excluding zero-margin pass-throughs are expected to be down 1% to up 1% versus our previous forecast of down 4% to down 1%. We continue to expect lower workers' compensation and SUI revenues on a per work site employee basis. For PEO margin, we now expect to be down 50 basis points to flat in fiscal 2021, versus our prior forecast for down 100 basis points, this increase in our guidance is driven by stronger revenues and a more favorable benefit from ADP Indemnity. Moving to our consolidated outlook. We now anticipate total ADP revenue to be down 1% to up 1% in fiscal 2021, versus down 4% to down 1% prior. And we anticipate our adjusted EBIT margin to be down 100 basis points to 150 basis points versus our prior guide of down 300 basis points. As I mentioned earlier, we now expect about $150 million in savings from the combination of our digital transformation, as well as our procurement transformation initiatives. And we will continue to manage our expense base prudently. As we saw in Q1, you should expect that further upside to our revenues, whether from macro-related factors or our own execution should drive upside to our margins as well. In August, we refinanced $1 billion of notes maturing in 2020. And as a result, we will benefit from approximately $5 million in interest expense savings this year. For our effective tax rate, we continue to anticipate 23.1% for the year. We resumed our share repurchases in Q1, and we assume a net share count reduction in our guidance. Net of all these changes, we are raising our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to a decline of 3% to 7%, which represents a much more modest decline, compared to our prior guidance of down 13% to 18%. I'd like to wrap up with a few comments on longer-term margins. To be clear, there has been no departure from our focused and consistent approach to continue to drive margins higher over the long-term. Looking beyond fiscal 2021, a continued economic recovery should support employment growth and above normal pays per control growth. And we would expect such a trend to contribute incremental margin uplift to our results, all else being equal. The impact of lower interest rates will also begin to moderate in the coming years. In addition to these macroeconomic factors, we expect our underlying margin performance to continue to be supplemented by our ongoing efforts to transform our organization and client service operations and to be supported long-term by Next Gen platforms that are more efficient and less expensive to maintain. As you have seen from our Q1 results, we are committed to protecting and driving margins, even as we maintain our steady approach to investing for the long-term. We remain confident in our long-term growth prospects and our ability to execute. And I look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for Q&A. I'd just add one other thought here or comment here. In addition to what Carlos said, I mean, look, obviously we're very encouraged and we're optimistic because of the great outperformance in Q1. But as you heard us say, we're very cautious because of the various uncertainties that we mentioned. But I would also say, we're cautious because as we look back in history and as we look at how in other recessions, how we recovered from that. We do see a period of chopping as it's not all kind of a straight line up in terms of the recovery during the great financial recession after that, we had I believe it was six quarters of negative sales growth after that and it was quite choppy actually. So we're expecting there to be some choppiness here as well. So I just wanted you to be aware of that. Yes. So on the sales investment, what I would say is maybe think about two big buckets in terms of investment from a headcount perspective and continuing to invest in marketing and digital marketing. The headcount investment, we kind of try to do that on a very steady pace over time, and that's been consistent with how we've thought about it and approached it. It was somewhat modest headcount investment in Q1 and that will ramp up during the course of the year, we're planning to continue to focus on and do that. And for sure have committed funding and resources, if you will from a digital marketing perspective to help support the bookings. Yes, and so we utilized \u2013 we basically utilized a portion of that reserve, which is a normal course of how it happens. I guess Q4 was just an outsized amount for that, we call it the backlog adjustment. It's just outside obviously because of the COVID impact and a portion of that was utilized in Q1, but nothing significant other than that. Yes. The other areas where we saw some particular strengths, and I think we mentioned already on the international side, particularly Canada was very strong for the quarter and also our compliance services area. So things like employment verification, unemployment claims, things like add more compliance of services related stuff saw a very strong performance in the quarter. Yes, definitely that incremental high margin revenue is the biggest contributor, but also, as we said look, we've been really focused on making sure we're doing a good job on cost control. We're keeping a close watch on headcount. We talked about investment in sales, but other than sales we're really controlling everywhere else from a headcount perspective. Very tight on discretionary costs, transformation work is coming along very nicely. We did a little bit better with the higher retention, better on bad debt expense in Q1. We think we're cautious about that because we think it could come and hit us in Q2 and Q3. So we've built that into our expectation. But those were the contributors. That\u2019s right. Yes, we had a couple of them, good sales. And we have several dozen, I think in implementation, active implementations right now. So the sales are continuing, the backlog, the implementations continued to scale up. So really no significant or substantial change in the outlook. Yes, just some more color from my perspective. I mean, I would just say, look, we continue to be, as we always have been very, very focused on growth and efficiency and becoming more and more efficient every day. So we're going to continue to invest where it makes sense for growth and for efficiency. So we talked about sales headcount and continuing to support that investment, investment in product. And we invest in efficiency, all of the digital work that we're doing isn't, it doesn't come for free. You have to make investments to be able to drive that efficiency improvement. So we're focused on all of that and we're going to continue to do that. Yes. So on the first thing, the out-of-business, I would not say it bottomed at all. In fact, we did not see a significant impact from out-of-business in Q1. I think the shoe has yet to drop there is how I would say it. And that's what we are forecasting and guiding that we're going to see some pressure from that in Q2 and Q3. That come in Q2, is there more stimulus that helps support it and we don't see it in Q2 and maybe it doesn't come till Q3, I don't know, but we're planning, I think we're cautious about it. And we're planning to see that pressure in Q3 \u2013 Q2 and Q3, sorry. Yes, so higher than it would be in a normal period. It's come down from where it was at the peak in probably April, May, June, it's come down from there, but it's still higher than normal situation. It's going to be choppy, right. I mean, we thought we'll cover it from the last recession that it was choppy. And I'm fully expecting it's going to be choppy this time around too, particularly right, we're in Q2. We're in the fall, going into the winter, it's cold, we've got areas where there's resurgences that people might be hunkering down again. So Q2 might be challenging, but even in normal situations, normal years, right. Bookings are going to be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. I'd focus more on the full year, the annual and the longer term view."

            "content": "Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call. This morning, we reported excellent first quarter fiscal 2021 results. I'm very pleased to say that across the board, we delivered a very strong start to the year that was well in excess of our expectations. For the quarter, we delivered revenue of $3.5 billion down just 1% on both reported and organic constant currency basis. And our adjusted EBIT margin was up 120 basis points, coupled with a slight increase in the effective tax rate versus last year in a share count reduction. Our adjusted diluted EPS grew 5%, much better than our expectation three months ago, which was for a meaningful decrease in EPS. On this call, we'll discuss the changes that drove ADP\u2019s better-than-expected start the fiscal 2021. In Q1, macroeconomic conditions continued to gradually improve and we executed extremely well in several key categories, including better-than-expected sales performance, a continued commitment to client service and prudent expense management. Let me start by covering key macro related trends to provide context to our results. Specifically on pays per control, out-of-business losses and client funds interest. During the first quarter, pays per control, which as a reminder declined 11% in the fourth quarter was in line with our expectation for high single-digit decline with a year-over-year decline of 9%. And a continuation of the trend we saw into our fiscal 2020 year-end, employment small businesses continued to show the most improvement, while large businesses actually showed some degradation as we exited the first quarter. Out-of-business losses performed better-than-expected as small business losses stabilized and a substantial number of clients that had gone inactive last quarter have restarted processing activities over the last three months. Finally, average client funds interest rates declined in line with our expectations for the quarter, but client funds balances were favorable to our expectations, declining 7% compared to our double-digit expectation. With that said, let me shift to the highlights resulting from our own execution. We delivered positive 2% growth in employer services new business bookings, which was significantly ahead of our expectations and marked a record Q1 performance. As you may recall from our commentary last quarter, we did expect some amount of sequential improvement relative to our Q4 bookings performance as economic condition stabilized. However, we delivered a much faster reacceleration as our sales force started strong in July and carry that momentum through the end of the quarter. We attribute the rapid reacceleration to a few key factors. First, we did see our clients and prospects show greater willingness to engage and purchase. But second and most importantly, we took action by maintaining our overall investment in sales and marketing, applying our best-in-class inside sales expertise to continue training our field sales force and utilizing innovative demos and other HCM content to start conversations. We've designed a client acquisition funnel that is successful even in the current environment. Our teams delivered across the board. That's everything from the downmarket where RUN continues to grow. And in fact, we've now exceeded 700,000 RUN clients for the first-time surpassing pre-COVID levels to the mid-market, where we're seeing clients showing more interest in fully outsourced HRO solutions to the enterprise space, where we had strong traction in compliance-related solutions. Our international sales were also strong as we closed several larger deals that were previously put on hold as prospects were waiting for a more stable environment to proceed. And our tax rates on many of our solutions continue to increase as well. This quarter, our workforce management solutions also referred to as time and attendance reached the 90,000 milestone for the first-time. And we're pleased to see that continue to grow our revenue. Our revenue outperformance was also driven by stronger retention. We are very proud to report that we hit record employer services retention levels for a Q1 period and our performance likewise experienced \u2013 and our PEO performance likewise experienced stronger than expected retention. While our retention likely benefited from having some clients delayed decisions to switch HCM vendors, given elevated uncertainty, higher client satisfaction clearly contributed as well. You may recall that last quarter we delivered record NPS scores across our businesses. As we helped our clients manage through government programs like the PPP. This quarter, I'm happy to say that across our businesses, we either maintained or reached new record NPS levels. We believe these results show that our commitment to providing outstanding service to our clients is paying off and we'll continue to do so. Combination of stronger bookings and retention in Q1 drove better revenue performance and the high incremental profitability associated with those revenues plus prudent expense management ultimately drove stronger margin performance as well. This is another great example of execution by our associates. And in a few minutes, Kathleen will cover our margin performance in more detail. I'd like to now provide an update on the progress we continue to make in driving innovation. Earlier this month, as part of the annual HR Tech Conference, ADP was given the Top HR Product award. This marks a record-setting six consecutive year that we have been recognized at the conference for breakthrough technology innovations, which is representative of how we remain committed to leading the industry with the premier HCM technology. This year, we were recognized for our Next Gen Payroll engine. And as we highlighted in our February Innovation Day, the benefits of this new engine include a policy-based framework that enables easy self-service and powerful transparency that allows practitioners and employees to more easily understand the effects of regulatory policy or potential life changes and is designed to be scaled globally. We continue to deploy our Next Gen engine to the market and we added another 100 clients during the first quarter. We remain excited about expanding its availability and driving adoption. And the feedback so far has been overwhelmingly positive. Ultimately, we expect a higher level of satisfaction to generate even better retention and higher win rates, supporting our long-term revenue growth trajectory. And we continue to innovate throughout our ecosystem. This quarter, the ADP marketplace reached 500 app listings and we are pleased to offer an expanding suite of offerings as we continue to drive millions of daily API transactions for tens of thousands of clients that are current users. And just this past week, we hosted our Annual ADP Marketplace Partner Summit, where we further strengthened our partner relations and provided actionable ideas to help our partners grow their business. Also earlier in Q1, we released our Return to Workplace solution that helps clients bring their employees back to work safely through a comprehensive set of tools designed to streamline and manage the process. We now have thousands of clients using the Return to Workplace solution, and we expect usage to grow over time as more clients start to gradually bring their employees back to the office or the work site. As I said, we are very pleased with the start of the year. And I'd like to recognize our associates from sales to service implementation and all the others who support them for their continued efforts in outstanding performance during this time. They continue to come through for our clients when it matters most. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Kathleen. Yes. I mean, I think that we'd like to be \u2013 given the momentum we just demonstrated, we'd like to be really optimistic, unfortunately, we all watch the same news and the backdrop in terms of these issues, it's not just Europe, I think there are some concerns here in the U.S. as well. And what we saw from April \u2013 March, April May, is that we stick to our story that our clients \u2013 if our clients are hunkering down and are unable to make decisions, it impacts us. So we remain positive because it doesn't feel like there's going to be a full lockdown across the board nationally like there was here in the U.S. last time. And we've clearly adapted, I mean we've \u2013 you can see it in the quarter, how much progress we've made in terms of being able to sell virtually and use online tools and really ramp up our digital marketing and a lot of other things that we can talk about that we've done to adjust our salesforce. But for us to tell you what our view is of RUN and Workforce Now and enterprise sales in the next two or three months, honestly is difficult other than to stick to our story around our guidance, which is really more about the full year and couching it in optimistic, positive and good execution terms, but also with some level of caution, because we're still dependent, I think on the healthcare situation and to some extent on the economy as well. One of the questions that you're not \u2013 you didn't ask, but I'm sure people are wondering is about this \u2013 question is stimulus. And that's another one that I wish we could tell you that we have kind of a scientific placeholder in our forecast around how much stimulus and whether there is stimulus or not and we don't \u2013 but that's another factor that I think would just create the kind of overall picture that would either be supportive or not supportive of our sales efforts, because clearly if you look at the last 20, 30 years of ADP, there is some general correlation between GDP and our sales results, our new business bookings. And that is impacted by not just the economic activity related to the healthcare crisis but also to things like stimulus, because obviously the government can offset down pressure on the economy, through stimulus as it just did, but there is also uncertainty around that as well. So I wish I could give you a more concrete, one thing I can tell you for sure is we're maintaining our sales investment, we're maintaining our optimism and we are gradually getting some people back into the field in terms of selling. And we're certainly pivoting in a big way in terms of using the large resources we already had with inside sales to really train a lot of our traditional field sales to be able to sell virtually. And I think you saw a great execution and great results in the quarter as a result of that. Yes. I mean, I think that's safe to assume that we would probably be on the side of the ledger of businesses that would benefit \u201cunder normal circumstances post pandemic\u201d. So in other words, once we get through the transitory nature of the challenge, I don't see how it's not a positive backdrop for companies like ADP and outsourcers who help people, first of all, maintain business continuity, and second of all, focus on their core business as you imply. So I think it has to \u2013 again, but we have \u2013 what do we \u2013 how many points of growth is that, only history will tell, but we think it will \u2013 we think it\u2019ll be a positive. Sure. I'm not sure that the call is long enough though to be able to give you all that, because one of the differences between us and some of our competitors, which I would see it as a positive, if I were all of you, is that we're very diversified both geographically and also across segments. So the answer unfortunately is complicated and it goes area-by-area. So in international for example, we're very happy with very strong results versus expectation, but also frankly, very strong results versus the prior year. But there were a few larger deals there, I think there were few global view deals that helped. And when you look at the core best of breed, like in-country solutions, we also outperform there versus expectations, but not as well in terms of versus the prior year, which is obviously understandable given the pandemic. So that's international. And then you move to the U.S. and the story in a downmarket is different and the midmarket is different than the upmarket. Although across the board, we were better than expected. But the growth year-over-year varied, because I think that's the biggest surprise, which we're frankly very excited about is that we have positive growth. But if you decompose it, it's a different story in each area. And we had tailwinds in the downmarket, I think as result of some big recovery that was probably some pent up demand, the PPP loans probably frankly saved a lot of small businesses and provided a lot of cash to small businesses to continue to kind of run their businesses and make decisions around purchasing solutions like what we provide to help them run their business better. So it really \u2013 by the way, our upmarket was also good and strong. So that was very encouraging the midmarket I think performed also better than our expectations. So I wish I could give you a simple answer. I personally see it as a positive, because if it was one thing that we could point to, I think it would be problematic because that could easily change overnight, but there really isn't, it's just a lot of execution across the board. I do think that we got a little bit of help, again, we don't have a scientific way of estimating it, but I've been consistent in the nine years that I've been in this job, because of knowing our culture and how we operate, the fact that our fiscal year ended where it did, we clearly had a little bit of pent up demand from call it May, June that carried over into July. I would say that, that was somewhat minor in this case, because getting companies to make decisions on your timeline is probably not as easy to do now as it has been in prior years. But historically when we have a bad year, we get off to a good start. And in some segments that didn't affect probably international business, didn't affect the downmarket, because the downmarket doesn't really have that ability to kind of hold off on something and started in the next fiscal year. But may have had a little bit of an impact. But we're pretty convinced that that's not a major story, but I thought I was important for me to be consistent, because I've been saying that for nine years, by the way, likewise, we have a blowout fourth quarter, we end up usually struggling at the beginning of the next fiscal year. So I think we have a total of a couple 100 clients, and I would describe that as still are very early compared to ADP\u2019s size. So if we were a startup, you'd be really excited. And I think we have a $20 billion market cap right now with only 200 clients, given what I've been seeing in the market. But the reality is that relative to ADP size and given our profile as a company and so forth, you got to take it in context, but we can't help, but be excited, because two years, three years, five years, 10 years down the road, it's going to be a big difference maker. I think it is, and that was our plan, when we built the business case, we've been at it for three or four years, this is a global scalable new payroll engine, it's incredibly exciting in terms of what it's going to do in terms of feature functionality, and hopefully client satisfaction, but also cost to maintain, cost to develop. But as you know, we have approximately 800,000 clients, sorry, 900,000, that's not fair because RUN, this has nothing to do with RUN. But a large portion of ADP's business is still on our current versions of our payroll engine, which by the way, all of these payroll engines are transparent to the clients. I don't know if any of you guys understand that, but Workforce Now and Vantage and Lithion, and all of our products are the front ends are really what our clients experience. And it's just important to remember that this is not like the transitions we had with Workforce Now, or even with RUN, because this is a gross to net engine that is really kind of underneath the hood, if you will of what the clients are experiencing on the front end. So that's positive too, because we don't anticipate a major migration effort, if you will, when we get to that, which is still at some point in the future. No. It's really \u2013 we really don't see any \u2013 I'm sure I know we did and I think some of our competitors did things to try to help our clients. And even in some cases prospects like there was a couple of examples of people giving away like three free months. And I think one competitor was doing six free months, et cetera. But \u2013 and one competitor changed their pricing online, but then changed to back a couple months later. So I would say there is nothing to report. There is really very little change in the pricing environment. This is not \u2013 I don't think this is really a question of pricing. I don't think you can impact end demand in a significant way in this environment through that, that would not be \u2013 certainly would be our view, that\u2019s not how to drive growth. I'm always bullish on the PEO. I was born in the PEO. And as you know, so the \u2013 I think the \u2013 as usual my answer has to be, if you look at the short-term, we have a lot of pressure in some parts of our business because of the healthcare situation. And the question is, do you want to look through that or do you want to stay focused on us, for example, in the PEO when you have clients shrinking, we from a discipline standpoint have some rules around that can sometimes affect \u2013 create adjustments, if you will, in our sales results, it puts pressure in the short-term on the sales results i.e., call it audits if you will. So if a client was sold and was valued at $1,000 and 12 months later, they're now valued at $900 because they're paying fewer people than we're collecting less revenue, which as you can imagine is happening with the majority of our clients that affects our PEO sales results. So I\u2019d say that the fact that workers\u2019 compensation, prices and costs have come down, which is part of the revenue picture, there is a lot of short-term transitory things. But I would say on a unit basis, our results were very good in the quarter. And we\u2019re very happy with that. And I would say that again, if there is any businesses that are going to be even more from a pure positioning standpoint, stronger coming out of the pandemic, the comprehensive outsourcing businesses, which PEO is one of them should be very compelling value propositions, because, as people look back a year or two from now, they might be thinking, I really don't want to go through that again. I don't want to be figuring out how to process, forget about payroll, because that \u2013 we have that covered. But most people \u2013 a lot of our clients do not use us for health benefits, processing or management of open enrollment, they don't use us for time and attendance, they don't use us for workers' compensation and our comprehensive solutions take care of the entire picture. And I think if you're a small and mid-sized business, if I were you, I'd be thinking about making that change, maybe not right now, because you've got other things that you're focused on, but I think six to 12 months from now, I would expect people to be seriously considering any options they have to deal with multiple things that are very critical to the ongoing operations and to their employees, but they may not have thought of pre-pandemic. I'm sorry, negative adjustment in which Q? No. We had a minor \u2013 I would say we had a minor, we talked about last quarter that we had taken some reserves because we expected to have \u2013 obviously clients that were going to cancel their orders and so forth to abuse laypersons terms. And I think that's exactly what happened. And I think our \u2013 we did reverse some of that reserve, but it was actually very much in line with the actual client. We had identified, we didn't do this kind of at a very high level. We had specific clients when we booked that reserve in our \u201cbookings\u201d, we had identified a list of clients that we thought were probably going to cancel in this first quarter. And I believe the two things\u2026 I think it's safe to say it would not have made a difference. I mean, it clearly would've made a difference if we hadn't had the \u2013 but if you want to know what our gross bookings performance was, it was not affected by our gross bookings performance, it did not affect our gross bookings performance. You would have had basically the same picture. Other than noise, I think we \u2013 probably the strongest performance was in the downmarket because much to everyone's surprise, there is strong business formation. And we saw that as kind of \u2013 we talked about that in our last call, remarkable recovery in small business very quickly at the beginning of the pandemic, both in terms of pace for control in kind of all categories, including this kind of new business formation. And I would probably add a note of caution there that to me is counterintuitive, and whenever in my career I've seen something that doesn't make sense, it generally \u2013 I think there is probably a little bit of payback at some point, I'm hoping I'm wrong, because if there is a relatively quick solution to the healthcare crisis, it's possible if the government managed to get small business through this relatively unscathed through PPP and all the other things that they've done. But in general it's a counterintuitive kind of situation. But we'll take it, it was positive. Yes, it\u2019s a great point. Like we don't always talk about some of these businesses that we have that are very good businesses, we call them standalone businesses. And we did have some good tailwinds from some of those businesses quarter. But again, I would tell you that they don't change the overall picture, but important to note that those were helpful. I would say it's safe to assume that most of it is as a result of that. But that I don't want to take away from us in terms of our execution, because, if we have higher revenue, we also frankly have more clients more employees to pay. So to the extent that we believe we can hold the line on expenses, some companies, you have to cut expenses, in our case, we just have to hold the line and that's probably good news, but I would say that mathematically you're on the right track, which is \u2013 that's a big factor. The incremental revenue is \u2013 a lot of it is flowing to the bottom line and helping our margins. I\u2019d say the only place where it's really meaningful and quantifiable is probably in the international space where we had, I think I mentioned a few global view deals that were delayed if you will, but that's actually not a \u2013 I wouldn't call it, that's not something that was in the \u2013 necessarily in the backlog because we hadn't sold it yet. So we don't actually book a sale until it doesn't go into the backlog until we get a contract. And so these were things that were in process, if you will, or in the sales process. And maybe we thought it was going to close in May or June, but by the way, maybe it wouldn't have \u2013 even without a pandemic, like there's really no way to, this is all frankly speculation stuff that we do when we get into these kinds of conversations. But I say that's the place where a field like we had a few large deals that we thought were going to close in the fourth quarter and didn't, by the way, client decisions, not us trying to move them from one quarter to the other. We want to get businesses as fast as we can. So we are always trying to book everything as quickly as we can, but some client delays in the international space, it's really not honestly a factor in the downmarket and very small factor in the mid-market in terms of controllability. We can't really sway our clients that easily from one way to the other. Maybe a little bit of that in the upmarket and in international, but you really can't do that in a downmarket and the mid-market. So I would say, there's a difference between, I guess I'm not sure what the nature of the question is, but I think I already said that there could have been some \u2013 in some segments of our sales force, if you have a terrible year and you're in the last month and you're not going to make the year, there's sometimes the tendency for people to hold and start that business in July. But I think you saw in our comments that August and September were also strong. So it doesn't feel like \u2013 people don't like hold something from May and June, and then book it at the last day of September. They typically put it in the first week of July. And so again, based on my experience and what I've seen here over the years, there was probably a little bit of that didn't make a material difference in the sales results. And it is where it is. We had a great start and I think great execution. And besides us leaning into our sales investments, the really big difference maker here is our sales force leaned in to drive results, right. And we're incredibly grateful to them for that. Well, we had \u2013 I think we had a good quarter like \u2013 frankly, if any client to me is a good point. It's good news. And I think we had three or four. I think Danny probably\u2026 We had some sales like closed. In other words, we got people to sign contracts in the quarter. Like, I don't know about anybody else, but I'm not spending a lot of contracts in this kind of environment. Like we just \u2013 the whole focus of this call is how we're focused on prudent expense management and trying to keep expenses down. So when people are coming to me, selling me things, I'm generally not a big signer on those types of things. So just shows, I think the value of \u2013 of our value proposition that people are still signing up because I think they believe that it will not only help them in the short-term, but that perhaps it can make them more efficient even in the short-term. So I think that is a good sign, right, of the strength of our products and the solutions and the pitch that we have. But that was good news. I mean, we were pleasantly surprised. I think besides the sales, we actually started, I think a number of clients, three or four also. These are clients \u2013 we actually sold new clients, new contract that are now going to go into the implementation process, but we had clients that were in the implementation process, a few of which delayed starting in the fourth quarter, but then we started them here in the first quarter. So I would say that's all the news. And on Next Gen Payroll, you heard what we said and sold 100, which again, I think is pretty damn good news, like in this kind of environment. Okay. So just to clarify, remember we outperformed not because we stopped investing or didn't invest as much as we said we were going to invest is because we outperformed on the top line, right. In terms of our revenue, even though some of it was clearly expense management and so forth. But I would say that the answer to that question is that, it's hard to wrap your head around our economic. I know it's hard because most companies don't operate this way, but for example, the better things get in terms of the macroeconomic, the more we're going to invest. And I know that's not going to make some people happy, but like for example, our fourth quarter, like our fourth quarter, like if things play out the way we planned in terms of the original guidances and we're not changing anything on you, but like our fourth quarter where we have easier comps, we would also expect to have great sales results, right. And those great sales results on a comp basis will also bring with them sales expense. And to the extent, we can get some of these clients started and our sales results improved, we're going to start also investing more and stepping on the accelerator and implementation expenses. So this is all carefully planned, carefully controlled as Kathleen was alluding to, like, this is not some kind of free-for-all in terms of expenses, but this is an amazing economic model. I don't know if you can see what we just delivered and what we're telling you that assuming that the situation cooperates with us, we probably will be either flat to slightly up in terms of revenue for the year. So that would mean that, we'll continue our streak of ADP of never being negative revenue growth, which is pretty remarkable, right. We had a massive decline in volume in the last quarter, massive declines in new business bookings. And you see now granted, this is not what we are targeting like, we'd like to have high single-digit revenue growth. So it's kind of weird that we're excited about flat, but it's all about the context and it's all about relativity. So it's really a great economic model, but the economic model is a long-term economic model. You have to invest in sales, implementation, and product to drive the results. This is not \u2013 we're not running the business quarter-to-quarter. And what that means is the minute we see the sunshine \u2013 the sun shining we're going to become boasted. It doesn't mean that our expenses are going to get out of control, but you will see our sales and our implementation expenses gradually come up. And along with that, some point our service expenses as well. But that's great because the most important driver of long-term value of this company is growth. It's not what the margin in next quarter or this year. There's a few others, like Kathleen mentioned bad debt expense is also something that, frankly has been shocking in the last six months where we've had, honestly like decreases in our bad debt expense, which makes no sense at all. So hopefully that will continue, but we didn't plan for that. I think we didn't roll forward three quarters of lower bad debt expense. Well, I would answer that question just by saying that we just invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new platforms in our key markets, because we intend to take market share. And on your question about clients not processing, we did mention that a number of small businesses restarted in the first quarter but there is still a sizeable chunk of companies that have gone inactive and remain in that state. No question about it. No. Other than \u2013 that's actually a great question, which we'll go back now and decompose that because we hadn't looked at it that way. At least, I hadn't. But I would say, my instinct would tell me that has more to do with how the operating plan is built than any macroeconomic or other major explanation. So I honestly, I wouldn't read much into that. That's a great question. And I have some sense of that from looking at the data right from the quarter. And I would say that our win rates are in line, I think a little bit better in some cases against a few competitors, which makes us very happy. But I would say, there's not a lot to report there that is, I think good news, but consistent if you will, in general. So it's probably more the former, right, which is the at-bats. And you could almost use the \u2013 what I call it, the traffic analogy, right. So ever since the pandemic started, whenever I go out on the roads, I do the traffic check and traffic is much higher and has been much higher over the last two or three months than it was in March and April. And that probably has something to do with, talking to just people on the streets, but people on the streets turn into people buying things and people going to restaurants and people going back to their workplaces and so forth. So I hate to be so crass and so simplistic, but I think that ADP is a very large company, which we're very proud of. And the gravitational pull of GDP and economic activity is strong in both directions. And I think we benefited a lot from, I think it's safe to say better than most people. I mean, I think this is not an ADP issue. I think most economists have raised their expectations about GDP. Unemployment is lower than everyone thought, even though labor force participation is lower. In general, things are better than people thought they were going to be and call it, May, June at this point. And we have benefited from that. I think that's I wish I could take more credit and give you a more complicated answer, but I think that is actually what's happening. The traffic is up for sure. Yes, I think on the first part of your question, it's of course \u2013 the last question, of course, has to be the downer question, because I think that that's a hard one for me to, I've been so optimistic the whole call, so I hate to like bring us all down. But based on what I'm seeing right now, both in the U.S. and in Europe. And the fact that this is our key selling season, I wish I could tell you that I'm incredibly excited and bullish and so forth. I just want to get through this damn thing, right. And get out to the other side. And I'm looking forward more to the third and fourth quarter and the fourth quarter and the next fiscal year than I am to the next two or three months, because the combination of the election with, I mean, you guys all see the same thing that we're seeing. And again, got to apply the test of common sense and the test of common sense would tell me that this is a, let's just try to keep us up beat, let's just call it a fluid situation. And again, of course, we also thought that the first quarter was going to be terrible and it turned out to be home run. So they easily go the other way, but I'm a man, I\u2019m like, I speak the truth, right. In terms of what I know and what I think at the time. And I spoke the truth in our last earnings call, and obviously I was wrong because things turned out to be much better. And I hope that happens here again, but that's my story. And I'm sticking to it, but one quarter or two quarters or three, it's not going to make a difference in ADP's long-term trajectory. What matters is the second part of your question, which is what do we intend to do? And what do we expect in terms of penetration rates and rollout of kind of our Next Gen platforms. And by the way, it's not just about Next Gen, I hope you guys understand that we are making some fairly sizeable investments, ongoing investments in Workforce Now. Workforce Now, now we have a version, if you will, I shouldn't call it a version, but Workforce Now is also on AWS in the cloud. So we've completely rebuilt Workforce Now to be as modern and as Next Gen, as Lifion and as our Next Gen Payroll engine. We also have been doing an enormous amount of work on RUN in the same vein, both at the guts of it in terms of the technology stack, but also on the user experience. You know what the investments we made in data cloud, you know, what we have with ADP marketplace, so this isn't an across the board increase in investment over methodically over the last six to seven years that I just summarize it by saying what I said once before, our intention is to have all of these things parlayed into taking market share and growing ADP faster than market and faster than the economy. Well, thank you all of you for listening. Again, in summary, I just want to, once again, I think compliment our associates and our leadership team for incredible execution in the short-term, but I hope you also heard our commitment to the long-term in both in terms of sales, R&D, client service and all the things that drive growth and long-term value for our shareholders. And hopefully, for all of you who represent them. We remain committed to expense management, the digital transformation, all the things that Kathleen said, but we are somewhat holds into obviously the circumstances around the economy and the healthcare crisis. But we remain optimistic that this is \u2013 and it's the reason for optimism, and this is a transitory situation that we're going to get through it, hopefully in the next three or six months to the point where things gradually start to get back to normal. And then ADP can get back to the normal growth rates that we're used to. So thank you again and appreciate, you\u2019re supporting, you're listening to us. And I hope that all of you continue to stay healthy and safe. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call.  I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After the speakers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanyal Hussain: Thank you Michelle, and apologies to everyone for the brief delay. Welcome everyone to ADP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fourth quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call and webcast. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our CEO, Maria Black, our President, and Don McGuire, our CFO.  Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call.  During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.  Today\u00e2\u0080\u0099s call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.  With that, let me turn it over to Carlos.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you Dany, and thank you everyone for joining our call. We finished our fiscal 2022 with a strong fourth quarter that featured 10% revenue growth and 12% organic constant currency revenue growth. We also delivered 170 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion which helped drive 25% adjusted EPS growth, and for the full fiscal year 2022 we ended up with 10% revenue growth, 90 basis points of margin expansion, 16% adjusted EPS growth, and importantly we achieved record bookings and near record level retention, reflecting our strong position in the HCM market. Let me cover some highlights from the quarter and year before turning it over to Maria and Don for their perspectives. Starting with employer services new business bookings, we had a fantastic Q4 with growth accelerating from the prior quarter, resulting in our largest new business bookings quarter ever. With this strong finish, we were very pleased to have delivered 15 ES bookings growth for the year. Despite several sources of global uncertainty, including the ongoing effect of the pandemic, the conflict in Ukraine, inflation and concerns about global recession, our compelling site of HCM offerings has continued to resonate throughout the market.  In total, we sold over $1.7 billion in ES new business bookings in fiscal 2022 and well over $2 billion when including the PEO, marking the first time we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve exceed $2 billion in bookings. Maria will talk more about the growth opportunities ahead, but clearly we are incredibly pleased with what is the best performance by our sales force that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in my 20 years with ADP. Moving on, our full year ES retention of 92.1% was nearly flat versus last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record level of 92.2% as we once again exceeded our expectations in the fourth quarter. Client retention is driven by several factors, including product and service quality, business mix, and macroeconomic factors, and our expectation at the start of fiscal 2022 called for macroeconomic factors like SMB out-of-business rates to drive some normalization in retention towards pre-pandemic levels. We did see some of that play out, but clearly less than anticipated. More importantly, our product and service teams have continued to deliver a best-in-class experience for our clients and particularly so on our modern and scaled platforms. We achieved record client satisfaction levels for the year and we once again set new record levels for retention in several of our businesses, including our midmarket, so although you will hear from Don that we are once again making an assumption for a modest amount of macroeconomic-related normalization and retention in fiscal 2023, we are excited to have delivered such a strong performance in fiscal 2022 and look forward to maintaining our retention rates at these historically high levels. Moving onto the employment picture, our pays per control growth metric was 7% for the quarter and 7% for the year, reflecting a persistently strong demand environment for labor among our clients that has continued to exceed our expectations. This growth has served as a testament to the resilience of our clients, and although we expect pays per control growth will naturally slow in coming quarters, employment conditions today remain strong with our client data suggesting that near term demand for labor remains healthy. Finally, our PEO business delivered another great quarter as it wrapped up a strong year. We had average worksite employee growth of 14% in Q4 and 15% for the year, and we were thrilled to have crossed the 700,000 worksite employee mark this quarter. As you know, I joined ADP two decades ago when ADP entered the PEO market through an acquisition, and as bullish as I was about the PEO industry back then, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure I could have anticipated we would be here 20 years later still growing at this combination of pace and scale, but the ADP TotalSource team continues to deliver a great platform, great service and a great benefit experience for our PEO clients and there is plenty of opportunity for us in the years ahead to serve even more businesses. Taking a step back, fiscal 2022 was unique in a number of ways. We experienced strong demand with over $2 billion in worldwide new business bookings and near record level retention which together drove us to surpass 990,000 clients at year end, putting us on track to exceed a million clients any day now. At the same time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had to manage this growth and volume with prudent headcount growth, given tight labor conditions. The way we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to do is through efficiencies, of course, but also through plain hard work by our associates, and for that, I thank them for their efforts and for coming through for our clients once again. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now turn it over to Maria.\nMaria Black: Thank you Carlos. With fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 behind us, I want to take this opportunity to review where we stand on some key initiatives and provide an update on where we are heading in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923. At the core of our client experience is their interaction with our platform, and one product initiative we had talked about throughout fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 is our new unified user experience, which was designed to be more action-oriented and contextual and to move us from transaction-oriented applications to experience-oriented applications; in other words, more intuitive, better looking, faster, and more consistent across our solution. To achieve this, we have applied a research-driven approach informed by the data and insights we have gained in working with our nearly 1 million clients. Our focus has been to listen to our clients, learn from them, and utilize their input to design the best experience. In fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922, we moved hundreds of thousands of clients over to this new user experience, including our clients on RUN, IHCM and next-gen HCM, as well as over 20,000 Workforce Now clients. We also moved the ADP mobile app over to the new UX. Feedback so far has been extremely positive and in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923, we plan to expand this rollout further to remaining Workforce Now clients as well as to additional modules and experiences within our key platforms. Workforce Now in particular has been exciting for us for a few reasons beyond user experience. First is its growing traction in the U.S. enterprise market. Just this quarter, ADP was rated for the first time an overall customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice provider in Gardner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual Voice of the Customer Study. This was the highest tier possible and was based on perspectives from end users with 1,000 or more employees and is a reflection of our continued momentum in selling Workforce Now to the lower end of the U.S. up market these past few years. This momentum builds on the already strong presence and traction Workforce Now has had in the U.S. midmarket in the HRO space and in Canada, all places where it is highly differentiated. Second is the continued roll-out of our next-gen payroll engine to a growing portion of our new Workforce Now clients. Our next-gen payroll engine not only benefits from having a global native and public cloud architecture but also empowers our platforms, like Workforce Now, to offer a better product experience and enables us to offer better service. We are incredibly excited for our payroll engine to continue to scale up to larger and more complex Workforce Now clients over the coming quarters. Finally, with talent and engagement an increasingly important aspect of the HCM suite, we continue to focus on our ability to help employers better connect with their employees. This quarter, we will launch a new offering that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re calling Voice of the Employee, a robust employee survey and listening tool which leverages survey instruments from the ADP Research Institute to offer clients a way to seamlessly capture employee sentiment across the employee life cycle. One of the things I love about this solution is that it was born out of elevated client employee engagement our return to work workplace solutions have been able to drive, and it reflects the ability of our global product team to quickly identify an opportunity and develop a solution to meet a need in the market. Moving on, we made some exciting enhancements to the Wisely program this quarter. Most notably, we now offer Wisely self enrollment with full digital wallet capabilities for Apple and Google Pay, thereby allowing employees to instantly receive and start using their Wisely account without support from their employer and without having to wait for a physical card. We also expanded our earned wage access solution by offering a seamless one app solution for Wisely members through a deeper integration with one of our key partners. The offering enables employees to receive a portion of their earned wages prior to payday, and most importantly is free for employees who use Wisely.  With these enhancements and more on the horizon, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re incredibly excited about the growth prospects for Wisely and look forward to taking it from over 1.5 million active members today to an even larger portion of our U.S. payroll base over the coming years. During fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922, we also highlighted the strength of our retirement services business, a key component of our HCM suite. We offer record keeping services, provide unbiased independent advisory services, and give our clients, their employees and financial advisors access to over 10,000 investment options from over 300 investment managers seamlessly integrated with our key platform and with the ADP mobile app. With over 125,000 retirement plan clients leveraging solutions, including 401-K, SIMPLE and SEP plans, we are proud of our scale today but even more excited about the significant opportunity in the market as we look to expand our market share within and beyond our payroll base of clients. Fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 was an incredibly strong year for our retirement services business and we are looking forward to another strong year.  Finally, our next-gen HCM solution is getting closer to a broader rollout as we continue building on the implementation capacity for our pipeline of sold clients, as we shared at last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investor day. While we are excited about all of these product enhancements and others too, products only drive growth when our sales and marketing organization can match it to a buyer and translate it into new business bookings, and to that end, we are excited about our sales and marketing momentum and the continued investments we have planned to drive growth this year. First, the product improvements I just mentioned, as well as many others, are all intended to drive higher win rates, an expanded breadth of offerings or higher price realization, and we fully expect our sales force to continue capitalizing on these opportunities. Second, we are making continued investment in both digital and traditional marketing into our brands and into our broad and growing partnership network. Third, we are excited to have invested at year end in sales headcount and are stepping into the new year with hundreds of additional quota carriers, and we expect to be able to grow our average sales headcount in the mid single digit range over fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923. Continued execution on our product and our sales and marketing strategy is ultimately designed to drive sustainable growth, and for fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 we expect to drive ES bookings growth of 6% to 9% bracketing around our medium term target of 7% to 8% from investor day. Growth is a priority for us, and we look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. Now over to Don.\nDon McGuire: Thank you Maria, and good morning everyone.  Our Q4 represented a strong close to the year with 10% revenue growth on a reported basis and 12% growth on an organic constant currency basis, ahead of our expectations despite higher than expected FX headwinds from a strengthening dollar. Our adjusted EBIT margin was up 170 basis points, about in line with our expectations as leverage from strong revenue growth overcame higher selling expenses, PEO pass throughs, and growth investments like the sales headcount growth Maria just mentioned, and our robust revenue and margin performance drove 25% adjusted EPS growth for the quarter, supported by our ongoing return of cash to our investors via share repurchases. For the full year, revenue landed at 10% growth. We delivered 90 basis points of margin expansion, offsetting a few different sources of incremental expense over the course of the year, and adjusted EPS grew to $7.01, up about 16%.  For our employer services segment, revenues in the quarter increased 8% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic constant currency basis. The stronger than expected revenue growth was a function of continued outperformance on key metrics like retention and pays per control, and our ES margin increase of 140 basis points was a bit lower than previously planned as a result of growing headcount faster than previously anticipated. For the full year, our ES revenues grew 8% on a reported basis and our ES margin increased 110 basis points.  For our PEO, revenue in the quarter grew 16%, accelerating slightly from Q3. Average worksite employees increased 14% on a year-over-year basis to 704,000 as bookings, retention, and same store pays all continued to perform well. PEO margin was up 260 basis points in the quarter due in large part to favorable workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation reserve adjustments. For the full year, our PEO revenues and average worksite employees both grew 15%, at the high end of our guidance ranges, and our margin expanded 80 basis points.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now turn to our outlook for fiscal 2023, beginning with some overall remarks.  We have on the one hand an inflationary environment that is creating upward pressure on our expense base, and at the same time we recognize there is clearly concern about a potential upcoming global recession, or that we perhaps are already in one. On the other hand, our momentum entering fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 is strong and there are no obvious signs of near term strength, and if the market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forecast of higher interest rates holds, we are positioned to benefit from a continued rebound in interest income. Our focus for now will be to continue executing on our strategy, and to that end, we have been and will continue to be making investments in headcount where we perhaps didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a chance to last year in a tight labor market, and we also expect to deliver growth that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at or above our medium term annual objectives shared at the November \u00e2\u0080\u009921 investor day. Onto the numbers, beginning with ES segment revenues, we expect growth of 6% to 8% driven by the following key assumptions. First, we expect our ES new business bookings growth to be 6% to 9%, which Maria covered. For ES retention, we finished the year at 92.1%, a touch below last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record level, and we believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prudent to anticipate some further normalization of business levels in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 even while we maintain record retention levels in some of our other business units. Our initial assumption is for a decline of 25 to 50 basis points in ES retention for the year. For pays per control, with employment back near pre-pandemic levels, we anticipate a return to a more typical 2% to 3% growth range. We normally talk about price as contributing 50 basis points to our ES growth rate, but we expect that benefit to be around 100 to 150 basis points this year.  For client funds interest revenue, we expect higher overnight interest rates and higher repurchase rates on maturing securities should combine with our continued balance growth to drive interest income up nicely. Our short funds portfolio, which is invested in overnight securities, will benefit assuming the Federal Open Market Committee increases the Fed funds rate over the course of this fiscal year, and our client extended and long portfolios will benefit as we reinvest maturing securities at an expected rate of about 3.3%. Between those two drivers, we expect average yield to increase from 1.4% in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 to 2.2% in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923.  We expect our client funds balances to grow 4% to 6%, supported by growth in clients, pays per control, and wages, and this is on top of a very robust 19% growth we experienced last year. Putting those together, we expect our client funds interest revenue to increase from $452 million in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 to a range of $720 million to $740 million in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923.  Meanwhile, the net impact from our client fund strategy will increase by a bit less, from $475 million in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 to a range of $675 million to $695 million in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923, and as a reminder, this is the number that impacts our adjusted EBIT. The slightly lower growth here is due to the expected increase in short term borrowing costs which track the Feds fund rate. This borrowing enables us to ladder our portfolio and invest further out on the yield curve than we otherwise would. As we gradually reinvest our maturing securities, this gap between client funds revenue and the net impact from our client fund strategy should reverse and again become positive. Back to the ES revenue outlook, one more factor to consider is FX headwinds. Clearly with the year-over-year parity the dollar with a weaker pound and with about 20% of our ES segment revenue being generated outside the U.S., we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re factoring in a fair amount of FX headwind for fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 of well over 1%. For our ES margin, we expect an increase of 175 to 200 basis points.  This coming year, our expense base will be increasing more than it does in a typical year, in part due to inflationary pressure on our overall wages and in part due to headcount growth, some of which we did late in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 and some of which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re planning for fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923, but because our margins are benefiting from strong revenue growth outlook, including growth in client funds interest revenue, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pleased to be able to guide to this strong ES margin outlook. Moving onto the PEO segment, we expect PEO revenues and PEO revenues excluding zero margin pass through to grow 10% to 12%. The primary driver for our PEO revenue growth is our outlook for average worksite employee growth of 8% to 10%. That would represent a bit of a deceleration from last year, but of course we are contemplating much less contribution from same store pays per control in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 compared to fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922. This 8% to 10% growth compares to the high single digit target that we outlined at the investor day in November. We expect our PEO margin to be down 25 to up 25 basis points in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 compared to a strong margin result in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922. Adding it all up, our consolidated revenue outlook is for 7% to 9% growth in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 and our adjusted EBIT margin outlook is for expansion of 100 to 125 basis points. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 to increase slightly to about 23%, and we expect adjusted EPS growth of 13% to 16% supported by buybacks.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make one comment on cadence - because we expect year-over-year headcount growth to be more significant early in the year and because the benefit from client funds interest will build as the year progresses, we expect adjusted EBIT margins to be down about 50 basis points in Q1 but then build steadily over the rest of the year. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to start with a demand question. Can you just talk about what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen across client size as it relates to demand environment? I heard the continued optimism in the mid market. Can you talk a bit more about up market, down market, international, and then just give us a sense of booking cadence. It sounds like it accelerated through 4Q. Have you seen any change in pace as you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve gone through the first couple weeks here in July?\nMaria Black: Yes, absolutely Bryan. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy to comment on both pieces. With respect to the overall strength that we saw in new business bookings both for the full year fiscal - very, very proud of the remarkable results, but for full year as well as the fourth quarter, and the strength was really broad-based. There was solid performance across each one of our markets. I think a few callouts that I would give, you highlighted the mid market. The mid market does continue to perform. We saw strength in our HRO offerings even beyond the PEO. The HRO was a strength for us. I know I mentioned it in the prepared remarks, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be remiss if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mention retirement services again. We also saw results in Canada, which was fantastic to see as Canada definitely was impacted a bit more with the longer lockdowns from a pandemic perspective, and then I continue to highlight quarter after quarter the strength that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in our down market and our RUN offer, so felt very pleased with the RUN. Then last but not least, on the international front, our international business had a tremendous year, so very confident in the results, very proud of the work of the sales organization.  As we think about the demand environment right now, you asked about how did it progress throughout the quarter and how do we feel sitting here a few weeks into July. I suppose I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily comment on in quarter, but what I can comment on is we did see the results accelerate throughout the quarter, so while there was some macroeconomic things happening in the world, our demand actually accelerated as we closed out the quarter, so we saw significant strength specifically in the month of June - in fact, June was a record month for us ever, as was the quarter and as was the year, as mentioned.  We feel good about the demand environment and the acceleration we saw throughout the quarter, and thank you for the questions.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, and then just a follow-up on margins. If things do slow down, can you just talk about the levers you have to insulate EBIT margins? It sounds like they have taken a healthy amount of resource additions. Can you talk about where you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making those across the organization and then where you might have some discretion to throttle investment, should things slow down?\nDon McGuire: Yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very good question, so thank you for the question. I think as I mentioned in the remarks and the materials that we distributed, we were able to get our sales organization a little bit more than fully staffed going into the fourth quarter, and that makes us feel really good about the opportunity to step off into \u00e2\u0080\u009923 with a fully staffed team, which is something that, as we mentioned in prior quarters, was a little bit more difficult to do during \u00e2\u0080\u009922, so I think we feel really good about where we are with staffing particularly on the sales side. I would also say that, just following the business model that we have, if you look at the record sales we had particularly late in the fourth quarter, we need to make sure that we have fully staffed implementation resources to get those bookings generating revenue as quickly as they can, so we will be focused on that, and then of course just following through to the year-end process, need to make sure we can service all those additional clients as that time comes upon us in late December-January-February. We can do all those things.  On the other hand, as I referenced and as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in the media and elsewhere, everywhere is talk about a recession potentially coming, are we in one, etc. We still do have flexibility of course, and we can certainly temper the addition of headcount and temper our costs more generally should we think that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as a result of changes in the macro environment, so I think we still have lots of levers and I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve shown historically that we are able to navigate those waters pretty adeptly should that kind of situation arise.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks so much, and congratulations on the results.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know if this will be for Carlos or whomever, but it feels like the retention step-up is clearly a little more structural, just given the recent trends in \u00e2\u0080\u009922 into \u00e2\u0080\u009923. Is that a function of the next-gen payroll engine or just where are you seeing that success, because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly been a super, super outcome post COVID. I think part of our focus is whether or not that starts to normalize or not, but it feels like it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at a structurally higher level.\nCarlos Rodriguez: There probably are some structural factors just because we can see, obviously, where the retention is stronger, and I think as we mentioned, some of the macroeconomic readjustment that we expected in a down market, we saw some of it, just not as much as we expected. But if talk of recession is correct and  business and bankruptcies and so forth probably will come back to some kind of normal level, which is why, as Don mentioned in his remarks, we once again plan for a slight decrease in retention in \u00e2\u0080\u009923, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really mainly in a down market in terms of the mix that it represents--the total represents of the mix, because everywhere else we really see some reasonable, what appear to be structural improvements. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really next-gen payroll because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really going to see that, the impact of that on sales and market share and so forth in the next couple of years because the majority of our clients are still not enjoying, I think, the benefits, even though over time they will of next-gen payroll, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really not--I just want to make I was clear on that, that that is not what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s causing the retention improvements.  But one thing I would point out is--I know this is a broken record, but we made this big transition from multiple platforms onto one in a down market 10 years ago, or a little bit more than that, and then more recently we went through a multi-year effort, which was painful to do that in the mid market. We have other things going on, like new UX and next-gen payroll, that those migrations and those consolidations in and of themselves have created some real structural tailwinds, I think, in terms of service, NPS, and ultimately on the retention standpoint. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a much more--an easier environment for our own folks to operate in, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier for us to invest in less platforms versus more platforms. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a much better environment. As you know, we still have work to do in the up market, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still opportunity there, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still some opportunity in employer services international as well, but we think these structural tailwinds that first helped us in the down market despite the macro, right, because the macro is really a cyclical issue, but overall excluding cycles, our retention in a down market is up--I said this before, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hundreds of basis points higher than it was 10 to 15 years ago, and now the mid market is at record levels and the NPS scores continue to be at record levels, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we anticipate that going back down. If anything, we see more opportunity there in the mid market, and our plan would be to continue to do that throughout other parts of ADP to add more structural tailwinds to our retention. \nKevin McVeigh: Super helpful. Then maybe this is for Don, it looks like the margin guidance, like 100, 125 basis points up from 90, given the leverage and float in pricing, it seems like really nice outcome on the pricing side. Is the offset kind of the cost inflation, and where is the cost inflation in the model in \u00e2\u0080\u009923 relative to where it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been historically?\nDon McGuire: Yes, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good observation. I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a few things driving it. Of course, we talked about more price than we historically have been able to take, and of course we do have the tailwinds, if you will, from the client fund interest, so. Certainly we need to remember that the reason we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting our interest rates is that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a higher inflationary environment, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driving more cost base in wages. The other aspect is that we have called out, and we typically haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t called out FX in the past, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve certainly seen, I think what we would refer to as pretty dramatic changes in FX headwinds in the fourth quarter compared to what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in typical years, and so we thought that was important to call out. With 20% of our ES revenue being outside of the U.S. and denominated in Canadian dollars, euros, sterling, Australian dollars for that matter, I think all the currencies are essentially down. When you put all that stuff together, it certainly results in a little bit less at the top line dropping through to margins, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been our focus. The other thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say is that we do have a little bit of conservatism as we look to the back half. We have to take into account all the things we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reading about and seeing and making sure that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking hard about how to prepare should something happen in the back half of the year, so I think those are the primary drivers, to answer your question.\nCarlos Rodriguez: And if I could add one thing, because you mentioned also price, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big topic. I know for a lot of companies, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of questions about it, and I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for you to understand strategically at a very high level, regardless of how it flows into the numbers and so forth, our view on price, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said it for a couple of quarters now, is to kind of keep up with inflation, so I want to make sure it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very clear that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not achieving our margin improvements for doing anything that would be unusual, because I think there might be some companies that are trying to make up revenue gaps or margin gaps with price because there is, quote-unquote, cover out there to do that. But I think when you do that, and I think Don has mentioned this before, that we operate in a competitive environment and we look at what competitors are doing and we look at what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the world, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re long term thinkers here, so you should assume that our price increases were in line with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening with inflationary costs and not anything more than that, and not materially less than that.\nKevin McVeigh: You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been very consistent on that. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi guys, good morning, and congrats on the numbers. I guess my question is looking at the midterm outlook for employer services back in November, I think we talked about a 6% growth rate, and you guys are going to be trending above that, 6% to 8%. With the strength in bookings growing over 15%, I just wonder if maybe the midterm outlook was a little low compared to what structurally is going on in the business model, that potentially the growth rate is faster than the 6% outlook that you gave over midterm.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, I hope so. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let Don comment in a moment, but again, just because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing this for a long time, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it out of my mind. The way the recurring revenue model kind of works is we love the 15%, and what you just described really comes through in the numbers. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the difference between our bookings and our losses--our strong retention and our strong bookings, that the net of that contributed more to employer services revenue than ever seen in my tenure as CEO, and that is what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s led to the deceleration you just described in ES revenue, so that net new business growth is really the way to grow the top line. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other factors in there, like pays per control, client funds interest, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the core of the business and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really happy with that. The challenge, of course, is that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not forecasting 15% bookings growth again next year, so I would just caution you, too. Now, the good news is that that increase in net new business is in our run rate now, and so we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to grow by as much the next year in terms of that net new business to further accelerate our revenue growth, but I would just caution you in terms of if you do that kind of math, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to accelerate the revenue growth rate of this company. We just did it and it takes a combination of better retention and higher starts, higher sales and new business starting in the upcoming year, and that 15% really makes it huge difference. But you can see from our guidance that that is not our expectation next year in terms of bookings, and so you will experience hopefully additional acceleration of revenue growth in ES, but not by as much as you had from \u00e2\u0080\u009922 to \u00e2\u0080\u009923. Notwithstanding the fact that, remember, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other things in there, moving parts like pays per control, client funds interest and so forth, some of which will give us tailwinds, some of which may be headwinds.\nDon McGuire: Yes, so Carlos covered off all the main drivers there. Of course, I think just once again I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go back and mention the FX headwinds we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re experiencing. I think when you add that into the mix, I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably get to a place where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re landing and what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re anticipating guiding to for \u00e2\u0080\u009923. \nBryan Keane: Got it, got it. Then let me ask you another popular question that everybody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s getting, is just how the model might be different now versus previous recessions, just thinking about the resilience potential in the ADP model.\nCarlos Rodriguez: I mean, Don again has, I think, a couple points he could probably make, but I would say as usual, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably some puts and takes. I mean, obviously I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a CEO if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say I think our model is better now than it was before, even though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been through a couple cycles here myself, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m criticizing anything other than myself if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m saying that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better than it was before. But we just talked about the structural retention level, so even if we have a little bit of a drag in the down market, and by the way, the down market is a larger percent of our overall business than it was 10, 20 years ago, but still it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s structurally higher by several hundred basis points in and of itself, so even if it goes down a little bit and is a little bit bigger part of our mix, I think our retention is just going to hold up better, I would predict, in terms of--you know, depending obviously on the severity of the recession, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge help because the bigger--obviously the portion of the revenues that you retain each year, the less dependency you have on bookings in a recession, which tends to be the most sensitive.  Historically when you look at GDP growth and all of our metrics besides pays per control, bookings is something that can be challenging in a severe recession, which to reiterate, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see. We read the same things everyone else reads and we know that Fed tightening will lead to a slower economic growth, but we really can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see it in our numbers. Our pays per control number in the fourth quarter was as strong as it was the whole year. When you look at the monthly initial unemployment claims, you look at the room that still is there in labor force participation, you look at the number of job openings in comparison to where it was historically, I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see it. There clearly are pockets that are happening. I think as part of readjustments because of COVID that are kind of confusing the landscape and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly some kind of slowdown underway because it just happens when you have Fed tightening, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not happening in the labor market, at least not yet.\nBryan Keane: Great, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-tsing Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-tsing Huang: Thank you so much. Really strong sales. I was just trying to think about attribution, the strength and how you would rank the factors there between better product set that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more relevant or better just productivity, expanded sales force, the cycle, or particular things around outsourcing taking over versus software. Any interesting observations on your side, Carlos or Maria?\nMaria Black: Yes, thank you. Definitely tremendous strength that we saw. I think I called out a few areas. Definitely the strength that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in our up market continues to excite us for the future. I think you asked about the attribution of strength, and I think it really was broad-based across the business, but I think from an execution standpoint, it really comes down to the execution of our sales organization and how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to go to market, candidly, really over the last two years as it relates to navigating this evolving environment, but more specifically providing value to our clients in a more meaningful way, and we really have seen that evolve over this past year as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been really across each one of the segments, helping our clients navigate, as I mentioned, the evolving environment inclusive all the legislative changes.  I think there is value we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bringing. I think the strong execution in general across the sales organization and leveraging the entire ecosystem to bring that strength, right, which is everything from our marketing investments, our brand investments, I spoke earlier to the headcount investments, and so all of this together, I think has lent itself to tremendous execution and strength as it relates to the overall performance.\nCarlos Rodriguez: The only thing I would add to that is Maria and I have been talking for the last 18 months about how--you know, one of the most important things for our sales organization was really to get productivity at the quota carrier level back to and then exceed from a trend line standpoint where it was, right, so when you think about whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GDP trend or price trends or anything like that, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to get back to where you were and then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to get back on that same trend line, otherwise you leave a lot of money on the table, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the economy or ADP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue and bookings growth.  From an attribution standpoint, again this--I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for you to understand this color. We had unbelievable productivity growth, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I said that this is the best performance I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen by our sales force. Clearly some of it is because we were in recovery mode, but sales forces naturally generally have--not that I know, because I was never a sales person, but I guess I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been around long enough to be hopefully an honorary member, but when you tell a sales force, okay, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to grow--we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to grow our headcount by a few percentage points and then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to grow our productivity two or three percentage points, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in a typical year, right, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard in a typical year. When you tell a sales force, you have to grow your productivity close to 20%, even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because it went down 20%, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s freaking hard to do, very hard to do psychologically. Anybody who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in sales, I think understands that, and so these percentage growth numbers that we have and the productivity growth numbers that we have, honestly, are incredibly just gratifying, because I really thought this was going to be hard. I was, of course, keeping my poker face on and just telling everybody, we have to do it, we have to do it, and we did it, so most of this growth came from productivity and not from headcount because, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about, we actually had some challenges up until the fourth quarter in terms of achieving our headcount objectives, not by lack of trying, by the way, and not because we were trying to save money, because we were doing everything we could and it was just a difficult labor market. The good news is in the fourth quarter, as Maria has mentioned, we really did quite well and are in a great position headcount-wise now, but the \u00e2\u0080\u009922 story is all about productivity, and that is an unbelievable accomplishment for our sales force, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s across the board.\nMaria Black: It is, and just to provide some actual numbers to that, so we reported $1.7 billion in employer services bookings - that is a record, as mentioned, and it does exceed the other record which was pre-pandemic in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009919 at $1.6 billion, and so that really in the end speaks to some of this additional productivity , if you will. But Carlos is spot on - we did initially tell the sales force people, we will add headcount and you have to grow faster, but in the end we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t add the headcount and they grew that much faster, which is why I am very bullish and excited as we step into the fiscal year with more sellers, more active quota carriers to really couple this strength that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had in productivity with now finally more sellers to go get after it.\nTien-tsing Huang: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great. It must be gratifying for sure. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stop there with that question. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Hey guys. Really nice results. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m very happy to see the strength in the enterprise that you called out . Can you maybe tell us, like--I know you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t parse out the growth between--in ES, but if you did, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to hear it in terms of the different sub-verticals. But on the bigger picture, can you tell us what types of firms--basically, are you now regaining share in some of those lower end of the large enterprise and sort of what size of firm it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming from and all these conversations . Thank you.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, I think you mentioned--we were having a little trouble catching the entire question, so maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to give a little bit of color and maybe you can repeat again, or ask us--ask the question again. But I think you said something about the lower end of the enterprise space and where the strength in sales was coming from, etc. I think just to repeat what Maria said, I think it is across the board, but that is one--the reason I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m picking up on it, this is a really good news story for us, so our Workforce Now platform--you know, we made the strategic decision two or three years ago, it makes sense because it fits well in the lower end of the enterprise space, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really been a home run for us there. Against certain competitors, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really very, very effective, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re selling a lot of units in that lower end of the up market space for us. As we continue with the rollout of next-gen HCM, which is really intended for further up market and eventually for global, in the meantime we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really having a lot of success in the lower end of the up market with our Workforce Now platform. If you want to maybe repeat your question one more time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give it another try.\nDan Dolev: No, I think that sort of answered the question. I wanted to know, and I apologize you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hear me before, I wanted to know how the conversations are--you know, how the conversations are different today when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re with those clients versus, say, three years ago, because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure there has been a tremendous change given the results. \nMaria Black: There has been a tremendous--it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good observation, there has been tremendous change. I think Carlos hit the nail on the head - in the lower end of the up market, one of the reasons we cited the award and recognition we recently received from Gardner because the conversation around our offering, our Workforce Now in that lower end, is definitely resonating for several reasons. One is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a best-in-class product, as Gardner even acknowledges and the users that were surveyed for that award, but moreover, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the speed by which we can execute and really take these enterprise customers and turn them into active clients, and so meeting a lot of different needs from a product perspective, from a timeline perspective. I think in the upper end of the market, certainly the conversation over the last three years has evolved. A big piece of that conversation is the global discussion and our ability to talk to much larger U.S. enterprise customers and other enterprise customers across the globe around our multi-country offerings and how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking about--how they are thinking about their strategic direction on HCM on the global front. I think the conversation continues to evolve on both ends of the spectrum of the up market, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re certainly in a position to have very formidable conversations and transformation discussions with our clients in that space.\nDan Dolev: Great, thank you, and excellent results as always.\nMaria Black: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Hey, good morning Carlos, Maria and Don. Great to see all of the years of hard work really pay off here this year, so congratulations on the results. Wondering with regards to the new bookings - I mean, $2 billion in total, $1.7 billion in ES, how much of that is split between new logos relative to up-sells, and how would you characterize your expectations on that front for the coming year?\nMaria Black: Thanks Mark, and thank you for acknowledging the strong performance in bookings. There is really no news to report here. I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve cited it for years - really, the split between new logos and client business really remains at that 50%, kind of 50/50 going forward, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really what we expect heading into fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923.\nMark Marcon: Great, and then with regards to the forecast, Don, you gave us a bit of a cadence sense for margin. How would you characterize it for revenue, and specifically what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m interested in is you did mention the interest on client funds is going to be back end loaded, but at the same time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got pays per control being modeled up 2% to 3%, even though people are starting to call for a potential recession and potentially a decline in employment, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m wondering how are you thinking about that part of the model and are there any things that you would call out with regards to just revenue trends as we build out the models for the coming year?\nDon McGuire: Yes, so Mark, just going back to the first part of your question, you mentioned the deceleration of margin that I mentioned, and of course we talked about the increase in sales headcount specifically because it is meaningful in quarter one of this year, in quarter one of \u00e2\u0080\u009922, so we do think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to have a bit of a drag. There are, of course, some other factors - general inflation, general etc., and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken price--Carlos described and took you through our price thinking, which is pretty consistent to what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve discussed over the last number of quarters, so we do expect to see a little bit of deterioration in margin percentage through the first quarter, and I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understood. Then as interest rates continue to--or as interest rates go higher and as we have the opportunity, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see higher client fund interest for the last three quarters of the year, but overall we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of looking at pretty even top line revenue quarter by quarter through the balance of the year. No big changes at all in terms of growth rates quarter by quarter through \u00e2\u0080\u009923 compared to \u00e2\u0080\u009922, so if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re modeling growth, you can feel be comfortable to model consistent growth across the top lines quarter by quarter.\nCarlos Rodriguez: And that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that you should model, or that we modeled everything consistently throughout the quarter, so--because I do have to make a comment on your point that it sounded like you thought we were being aggressive, which would not be typical of us to model 2% to 3% pays per control when everyone is thinking there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a recession. I would tell you that the fourth quarter, you saw what our pays per control growth was, and I can tell you that we have visibility into July and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to believe that for the whole year, it would be less than 2% to 3%, but then you can assume that if, for example, the first couple of months at least, since we have some visibility of that already, are in the 6% to 7% range, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of exiting, and you can do the math, right, so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably--this is just to give you color in terms of what some of our assumptions are in our operating plan, because I think Don mentioned maybe a bit of conservatism on the back half. We probably have reasonable continuation of trends, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way trends go, on pays per control in the first half, and then you would probably expect the second half of the year to have little to no pays per control growth, or somewhere in that neighborhood.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also hard for us to model a big negative growth on pays per control just because of all the factors we mentioned in the labor market. That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen in \u00e2\u0080\u009924 or late in \u00e2\u0080\u009923, or at some point in history, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem likely over the course of our fiscal year. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re clearly expecting some slowdown in the second half.\nMark Marcon: Carlos, you read my mind in terms of just the way I was thinking about the characterization and then thinking, okay, this is probably what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking in terms of the way it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to unfold, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s directly in line. Can I just ask one more question? On Workforce Now, would you expect next-gen payroll, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the expectation in terms of the number of clients that would have next-gen payroll within the Workforce Now contingent by the end of the year?\nCarlos Rodriguez: In terms of new business bookings, because obviously--we just want to make sure we answer the question correctly. It will only affect--obviously we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not even talking about migrations yet, even though at some point that will happen--\nMark Marcon: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I was asking. Are we going to do any migrations over the course of this year?\nCarlos Rodriguez: No. \nMark Marcon: Okay, great. Thank you and congrats again.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi there. Thanks for taking my question today.  I wanted to ask if you are seeing or expect to see any divergence in the kind of hiring or macro--hiring environment or macro impact between the U.S. and Europe. I guess the broader question is, does your guidance assume a tougher environment in Europe relative to the U.S. or something similar?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Don probably has the details, but I can give you some high level color. Pays per control growth--I know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not asking about historical, but as we gather the data, I just want to tell you that pays per control growth is very strong in employer services international as well, and part of that, of course, is because of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming off of, right, which were these lockdowns and these high unemployment rates across the globe. I would say international has performed similarly, but it is safe to assume that we see probably challenges given what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the macro environment with energy costs and the war and so forth in our international business. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, Don, if you have--\nDon McGuire: No Carlos, I think those points are valid. Certainly what happens with energy on the continent in particular is going to have some impacts on the results, but beyond that--this is a little bit of the conundrum that we talked about earlier, about where we are versus what people are talking about. So as much as everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predicting a recession, etc., unemployment rates in the euro zone are at 6.1%, which is an all-time low. Unemployment rates in Canada are as low as they were even before I started working, in 1974. Unemployment rates in Australia are at a 50-year low, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got this situation where there seems to be a lot of employment yet all this risk and worry about recession.  To come back to your question, are we a little bit more concerned about what could happen in EMEA in particular as a result of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on with current prices, etc.? A little bit more concerned, yes. Did we think about that when we put our plans together? To some extent, yes.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Don, you should point out that you started working in 1974 when you were 12 years old.\nDon McGuire: Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say .\nRamsey El-Assal: That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very helpful. A follow-up question, just update us on M&A, capital allocation. Are you shifting your approach at all? Are you seeing incremental opportunity out there given the turmoil with valuations in the marketplace, potential acquisition targets, or is it just sort of steady as she goes in terms of no change?\nDon McGuire: Yes, I think for now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much steady as she goes. I mean, certainly you can see the valuations have dropped across the board. Things that were really expensive in January are still just expensive. Things are still expensive, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come down off of historic highs, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not exactly what I would call a bunch of bargains out there. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also not a lot of people who are coming forward looking to sell their properties because prices are down, so I would say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steady as she goes and we will continue to do what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done and look for things that work for us strategically, look for adjacencies that make sense should they arise. But really, steady as she goes, really no change to our overall policy.\nRamsey El-Assal: Great, thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you, good morning. Don, you called out a 260 basis point margin increase in PEO year-over-year, in part driven by a favorable workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation reserve adjustment. How much was that adjustment, and how should we think about this item for fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923?\nDon McGuire: I guess the short answer is we get adjustments on a regular basis, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been favorable for us. We look at the workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation experience over a number of years and we get external third parties to do an assessment as to whether or not it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appropriate to book any of those adjustments, and this year we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been fortunate. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t typically forecast those numbers in any great detail simply because we do have to rely on the experience rating that the insurance companies bring to us, and so without trying to disclose exactly what the numbers were, I would say they were favorable and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to wait as the months go by to see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen in \u00e2\u0080\u009923.\nCarlos Rodriguez: We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re disclosing it in our 10-K, so we can--\nDanyal Hussain: Yes, it was $40 million for the quarter, David, in the K, and that compares to last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about $5 million. Most of that was as we headed into the quarter in the forecast and guidance, so it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a big departure from what we had expected. \nCarlos Rodriguez: But I think what Don was trying to say, though, about \u00e2\u0080\u009923 is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly a headwind, right, so as we--as you do your modeling and you think about margins, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a headwind not because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an operating performance issue or whatnot, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just because we had a big benefit in \u00e2\u0080\u009922 and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not planning for a big benefit in \u00e2\u0080\u009923, although we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always hopeful that we will get some benefit. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historically been our experience, is that we do get some critical reserve release. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably not as big in \u00e2\u0080\u009923 as in \u00e2\u0080\u009922, but it might not be as big a headwind as it appears now, just because of the numbers.\nDavid Togut: Appreciate that. Just as a quick follow-up, Don, in the guidance you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve given for extended investment strategy, client fund interest to be up about $200 million to $220 million year-over-year in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923, how should we think about the incremental margin on that additional revenue? Are you applying additional expenses against it or should we think about it flowing through at some set margin?\nDon McGuire: Yes, so I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other things going on, of course. We mentioned the inflationary environment, which is why have the higher interest rates. We mentioned the FX headwinds we have, so all things in, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still expecting--we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still very happy and very proud of the operating margin improvements we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting and we think we still have good opportunity for margin improvements ex-client fund interest going forward. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say that right now, our expectations are for a pretty balanced incremental margin from both of those factors, so we are of course, as we mentioned--you know, we are spending some more money, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re investing in sales headcount, we have higher costs as a result of inflation, some of it is offset by price, but we are letting a substantial amount fall to the bottom line but we are obviously in this for the long term, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take the opportunity to invest in the business and make sure that we have the right balance between margin growth and preparing ourselves for continued success in the future years.\nCarlos Rodriguez: But I think that stream of revenue, we would generally see it as 100% margin, just to be completely clear. If that  your question, do we apply expenses against those revenues, the answer is I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve--it felt like a trick question because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve known us for a long time and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been clear for a long--like, on the way down, we always say it 100% hurts us, right, because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really no expenses that go away when that interest income goes away, so likewise we would want to be transparent and acknowledge that on the way up, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 100% margin. But I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure if it was a trick question or--it sounds like it was.\nDavid Togut: No, it was just trying to understand how much of that incremental revenue would flow through to the bottom line since Don had talked a lot about investment initiatives, and you had underscored growth in sales force headcount. But thank you so much, very responsive. I appreciate it.\nDanyal Hussain: David, I would just add one clarification. You said incremental revenue. We did make the point in the prepared remarks that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the net impact of the portfolio that would be 100% incremental margin, so there is a cost offset and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the short term borrowing cost associated with the portfolio strategy.\nDavid Togut: Much appreciated, thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one more question, and that question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSamad Samana: Hi, great. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to maybe circle back on the price increases. I know that inflation is a big driver of the maybe more than normal amount. Can you just maybe help us understand, would that put the company back on track if I think about deposit increases in maybe fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009921 during COVID, would it be linear from pre-COVID levels if we just thought about the price increases compounding or would it put you ahead of that because of inflation? Carlos, can you just remind us, do those price increases tend to stick if inflation starts to roll over?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, I think again strategically, and maybe Dany and Don can get more specific on the numbers, but I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t characterize what we did as being out of step with the market. There was a pause for a few months, but our price increases--our intention was that our price increases during COVID were reflective of the inflation environment at that time as well. We did pause for a few months because, timing-wise, we just thought particularly in 2020 that it was inappropriate to be giving clients price increases one or two months into a global pandemic, but we eventually did some price increases but we did very modest price increases, because inflation was near zero for some period of time.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t if that answers it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to be responsive, but I think in general, we are always trying to remain in step with the market and still be competitive, because our number one goal is to gain market share. The trap that is easy to fall into when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a large company like ours is you can take price and take it higher than maybe you should be. You can usually do that multiple times and you can do that for a while, but it just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work forever because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the law of economics and large numbers, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because of competition. So our intention, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for you to understand that strategically is we want to grow and we want to gain market share, and to do that, we have to be competitive in terms of our products, our service, and also our price, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s--so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important when we do pricing actions, either on new business or on our existing book of business, that we remain in line with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the general market and with our competitors. \nSamad Samana: Great, I appreciate that, and good to see the strong results.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you. I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve--we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very happy with the quarter, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure what else I could say, other than what I said about our sales performance, which I think is definitely the best I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in a long time. We talked a lot about our retention and some of the structural issues that are happening there, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to be more pleased about that. But I do want to reiterate again how happy we are with our organization and our team. First, we started with COVID and all the uncertainty that that created, everybody having to work from home, then we have all these regulatory changes, some of them very positive like the PPP loans, the ERPC that happened across the world, and while we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re then in the middle of that pandemic, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re telling our associates that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to work weekends and nights because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to keep up with all these regulatory changes and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to help our clients. Then as soon as that starts to abate a little bit, we get this great reshuffling and we start having challenges, which we overcame in terms of being able to add to staffing and so forth, so we asked our associates to once again work harder, put in the extra effort, and every time we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve asked, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come through for us, so--and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come through, more importantly, for our clients. We really do provide critical services across the world to our clients, and it was very, very important for our organization to come through for our clients, and I just want to again thank our associates for making it through so many ups and downs, where we just keep asking for a little bit more and they keep delivering, so I want to thank them once again.  Once again, thank you for your attention and your interest and the great questions, and we look forward to talking again in the next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the program.

            "name": "Maria Black",
            "content": "Thank you Carlos. With fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 behind us, I want to take this opportunity to review where we stand on some key initiatives and provide an update on where we are heading in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923. At the core of our client experience is their interaction with our platform, and one product initiative we had talked about throughout fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 is our new unified user experience, which was designed to be more action-oriented and contextual and to move us from transaction-oriented applications to experience-oriented applications; in other words, more intuitive, better looking, faster, and more consistent across our solution. To achieve this, we have applied a research-driven approach informed by the data and insights we have gained in working with our nearly 1 million clients. Our focus has been to listen to our clients, learn from them, and utilize their input to design the best experience. In fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922, we moved hundreds of thousands of clients over to this new user experience, including our clients on RUN, IHCM and next-gen HCM, as well as over 20,000 Workforce Now clients. We also moved the ADP mobile app over to the new UX. Feedback so far has been extremely positive and in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923, we plan to expand this rollout further to remaining Workforce Now clients as well as to additional modules and experiences within our key platforms. Workforce Now in particular has been exciting for us for a few reasons beyond user experience. First is its growing traction in the U.S. enterprise market. Just this quarter, ADP was rated for the first time an overall customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s choice provider in Gardner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s annual Voice of the Customer Study. This was the highest tier possible and was based on perspectives from end users with 1,000 or more employees and is a reflection of our continued momentum in selling Workforce Now to the lower end of the U.S. up market these past few years. This momentum builds on the already strong presence and traction Workforce Now has had in the U.S. midmarket in the HRO space and in Canada, all places where it is highly differentiated. Second is the continued roll-out of our next-gen payroll engine to a growing portion of our new Workforce Now clients. Our next-gen payroll engine not only benefits from having a global native and public cloud architecture but also empowers our platforms, like Workforce Now, to offer a better product experience and enables us to offer better service. We are incredibly excited for our payroll engine to continue to scale up to larger and more complex Workforce Now clients over the coming quarters. Finally, with talent and engagement an increasingly important aspect of the HCM suite, we continue to focus on our ability to help employers better connect with their employees. This quarter, we will launch a new offering that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re calling Voice of the Employee, a robust employee survey and listening tool which leverages survey instruments from the ADP Research Institute to offer clients a way to seamlessly capture employee sentiment across the employee life cycle. One of the things I love about this solution is that it was born out of elevated client employee engagement our return to work workplace solutions have been able to drive, and it reflects the ability of our global product team to quickly identify an opportunity and develop a solution to meet a need in the market. Moving on, we made some exciting enhancements to the Wisely program this quarter. Most notably, we now offer Wisely self enrollment with full digital wallet capabilities for Apple and Google Pay, thereby allowing employees to instantly receive and start using their Wisely account without support from their employer and without having to wait for a physical card. We also expanded our earned wage access solution by offering a seamless one app solution for Wisely members through a deeper integration with one of our key partners. The offering enables employees to receive a portion of their earned wages prior to payday, and most importantly is free for employees who use Wisely.  With these enhancements and more on the horizon, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re incredibly excited about the growth prospects for Wisely and look forward to taking it from over 1.5 million active members today to an even larger portion of our U.S. payroll base over the coming years. During fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922, we also highlighted the strength of our retirement services business, a key component of our HCM suite. We offer record keeping services, provide unbiased independent advisory services, and give our clients, their employees and financial advisors access to over 10,000 investment options from over 300 investment managers seamlessly integrated with our key platform and with the ADP mobile app. With over 125,000 retirement plan clients leveraging solutions, including 401-K, SIMPLE and SEP plans, we are proud of our scale today but even more excited about the significant opportunity in the market as we look to expand our market share within and beyond our payroll base of clients. Fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 was an incredibly strong year for our retirement services business and we are looking forward to another strong year.  Finally, our next-gen HCM solution is getting closer to a broader rollout as we continue building on the implementation capacity for our pipeline of sold clients, as we shared at last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s investor day. While we are excited about all of these product enhancements and others too, products only drive growth when our sales and marketing organization can match it to a buyer and translate it into new business bookings, and to that end, we are excited about our sales and marketing momentum and the continued investments we have planned to drive growth this year. First, the product improvements I just mentioned, as well as many others, are all intended to drive higher win rates, an expanded breadth of offerings or higher price realization, and we fully expect our sales force to continue capitalizing on these opportunities. Second, we are making continued investment in both digital and traditional marketing into our brands and into our broad and growing partnership network. Third, we are excited to have invested at year end in sales headcount and are stepping into the new year with hundreds of additional quota carriers, and we expect to be able to grow our average sales headcount in the mid single digit range over fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923. Continued execution on our product and our sales and marketing strategy is ultimately designed to drive sustainable growth, and for fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 we expect to drive ES bookings growth of 6% to 9% bracketing around our medium term target of 7% to 8% from investor day. Growth is a priority for us, and we look forward to continuing to update you on our progress. Now over to Don. Yes, absolutely Bryan. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m happy to comment on both pieces. With respect to the overall strength that we saw in new business bookings both for the full year fiscal - very, very proud of the remarkable results, but for full year as well as the fourth quarter, and the strength was really broad-based. There was solid performance across each one of our markets. I think a few callouts that I would give, you highlighted the mid market. The mid market does continue to perform. We saw strength in our HRO offerings even beyond the PEO. The HRO was a strength for us. I know I mentioned it in the prepared remarks, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be remiss if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mention retirement services again. We also saw results in Canada, which was fantastic to see as Canada definitely was impacted a bit more with the longer lockdowns from a pandemic perspective, and then I continue to highlight quarter after quarter the strength that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in our down market and our RUN offer, so felt very pleased with the RUN. Then last but not least, on the international front, our international business had a tremendous year, so very confident in the results, very proud of the work of the sales organization.  As we think about the demand environment right now, you asked about how did it progress throughout the quarter and how do we feel sitting here a few weeks into July. I suppose I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily comment on in quarter, but what I can comment on is we did see the results accelerate throughout the quarter, so while there was some macroeconomic things happening in the world, our demand actually accelerated as we closed out the quarter, so we saw significant strength specifically in the month of June - in fact, June was a record month for us ever, as was the quarter and as was the year, as mentioned.  We feel good about the demand environment and the acceleration we saw throughout the quarter, and thank you for the questions. Yes, thank you. Definitely tremendous strength that we saw. I think I called out a few areas. Definitely the strength that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in our up market continues to excite us for the future. I think you asked about the attribution of strength, and I think it really was broad-based across the business, but I think from an execution standpoint, it really comes down to the execution of our sales organization and how they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to go to market, candidly, really over the last two years as it relates to navigating this evolving environment, but more specifically providing value to our clients in a more meaningful way, and we really have seen that evolve over this past year as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been really across each one of the segments, helping our clients navigate, as I mentioned, the evolving environment inclusive all the legislative changes.  I think there is value we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re bringing. I think the strong execution in general across the sales organization and leveraging the entire ecosystem to bring that strength, right, which is everything from our marketing investments, our brand investments, I spoke earlier to the headcount investments, and so all of this together, I think has lent itself to tremendous execution and strength as it relates to the overall performance. It is, and just to provide some actual numbers to that, so we reported $1.7 billion in employer services bookings - that is a record, as mentioned, and it does exceed the other record which was pre-pandemic in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009919 at $1.6 billion, and so that really in the end speaks to some of this additional productivity , if you will. But Carlos is spot on - we did initially tell the sales force people, we will add headcount and you have to grow faster, but in the end we didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t add the headcount and they grew that much faster, which is why I am very bullish and excited as we step into the fiscal year with more sellers, more active quota carriers to really couple this strength that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had in productivity with now finally more sellers to go get after it. There has been a tremendous--it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good observation, there has been tremendous change. I think Carlos hit the nail on the head - in the lower end of the up market, one of the reasons we cited the award and recognition we recently received from Gardner because the conversation around our offering, our Workforce Now in that lower end, is definitely resonating for several reasons. One is it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a best-in-class product, as Gardner even acknowledges and the users that were surveyed for that award, but moreover, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also the speed by which we can execute and really take these enterprise customers and turn them into active clients, and so meeting a lot of different needs from a product perspective, from a timeline perspective. I think in the upper end of the market, certainly the conversation over the last three years has evolved. A big piece of that conversation is the global discussion and our ability to talk to much larger U.S. enterprise customers and other enterprise customers across the globe around our multi-country offerings and how we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking about--how they are thinking about their strategic direction on HCM on the global front. I think the conversation continues to evolve on both ends of the spectrum of the up market, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re certainly in a position to have very formidable conversations and transformation discussions with our clients in that space. Thank you. Thanks Mark, and thank you for acknowledging the strong performance in bookings. There is really no news to report here. I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve cited it for years - really, the split between new logos and client business really remains at that 50%, kind of 50/50 going forward, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really what we expect heading into fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923."

            "content": "Thank you Dany, and thank you everyone for joining our call. We finished our fiscal 2022 with a strong fourth quarter that featured 10% revenue growth and 12% organic constant currency revenue growth. We also delivered 170 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion which helped drive 25% adjusted EPS growth, and for the full fiscal year 2022 we ended up with 10% revenue growth, 90 basis points of margin expansion, 16% adjusted EPS growth, and importantly we achieved record bookings and near record level retention, reflecting our strong position in the HCM market. Let me cover some highlights from the quarter and year before turning it over to Maria and Don for their perspectives. Starting with employer services new business bookings, we had a fantastic Q4 with growth accelerating from the prior quarter, resulting in our largest new business bookings quarter ever. With this strong finish, we were very pleased to have delivered 15 ES bookings growth for the year. Despite several sources of global uncertainty, including the ongoing effect of the pandemic, the conflict in Ukraine, inflation and concerns about global recession, our compelling site of HCM offerings has continued to resonate throughout the market.  In total, we sold over $1.7 billion in ES new business bookings in fiscal 2022 and well over $2 billion when including the PEO, marking the first time we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve exceed $2 billion in bookings. Maria will talk more about the growth opportunities ahead, but clearly we are incredibly pleased with what is the best performance by our sales force that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in my 20 years with ADP. Moving on, our full year ES retention of 92.1% was nearly flat versus last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record level of 92.2% as we once again exceeded our expectations in the fourth quarter. Client retention is driven by several factors, including product and service quality, business mix, and macroeconomic factors, and our expectation at the start of fiscal 2022 called for macroeconomic factors like SMB out-of-business rates to drive some normalization in retention towards pre-pandemic levels. We did see some of that play out, but clearly less than anticipated. More importantly, our product and service teams have continued to deliver a best-in-class experience for our clients and particularly so on our modern and scaled platforms. We achieved record client satisfaction levels for the year and we once again set new record levels for retention in several of our businesses, including our midmarket, so although you will hear from Don that we are once again making an assumption for a modest amount of macroeconomic-related normalization and retention in fiscal 2023, we are excited to have delivered such a strong performance in fiscal 2022 and look forward to maintaining our retention rates at these historically high levels. Moving onto the employment picture, our pays per control growth metric was 7% for the quarter and 7% for the year, reflecting a persistently strong demand environment for labor among our clients that has continued to exceed our expectations. This growth has served as a testament to the resilience of our clients, and although we expect pays per control growth will naturally slow in coming quarters, employment conditions today remain strong with our client data suggesting that near term demand for labor remains healthy. Finally, our PEO business delivered another great quarter as it wrapped up a strong year. We had average worksite employee growth of 14% in Q4 and 15% for the year, and we were thrilled to have crossed the 700,000 worksite employee mark this quarter. As you know, I joined ADP two decades ago when ADP entered the PEO market through an acquisition, and as bullish as I was about the PEO industry back then, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure I could have anticipated we would be here 20 years later still growing at this combination of pace and scale, but the ADP TotalSource team continues to deliver a great platform, great service and a great benefit experience for our PEO clients and there is plenty of opportunity for us in the years ahead to serve even more businesses. Taking a step back, fiscal 2022 was unique in a number of ways. We experienced strong demand with over $2 billion in worldwide new business bookings and near record level retention which together drove us to surpass 990,000 clients at year end, putting us on track to exceed a million clients any day now. At the same time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had to manage this growth and volume with prudent headcount growth, given tight labor conditions. The way we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been able to do is through efficiencies, of course, but also through plain hard work by our associates, and for that, I thank them for their efforts and for coming through for our clients once again. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now turn it over to Maria. There probably are some structural factors just because we can see, obviously, where the retention is stronger, and I think as we mentioned, some of the macroeconomic readjustment that we expected in a down market, we saw some of it, just not as much as we expected. But if talk of recession is correct and  business and bankruptcies and so forth probably will come back to some kind of normal level, which is why, as Don mentioned in his remarks, we once again plan for a slight decrease in retention in \u00e2\u0080\u009923, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really mainly in a down market in terms of the mix that it represents--the total represents of the mix, because everywhere else we really see some reasonable, what appear to be structural improvements. I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really next-gen payroll because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really going to see that, the impact of that on sales and market share and so forth in the next couple of years because the majority of our clients are still not enjoying, I think, the benefits, even though over time they will of next-gen payroll, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really not--I just want to make I was clear on that, that that is not what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s causing the retention improvements.  But one thing I would point out is--I know this is a broken record, but we made this big transition from multiple platforms onto one in a down market 10 years ago, or a little bit more than that, and then more recently we went through a multi-year effort, which was painful to do that in the mid market. We have other things going on, like new UX and next-gen payroll, that those migrations and those consolidations in and of themselves have created some real structural tailwinds, I think, in terms of service, NPS, and ultimately on the retention standpoint. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a much more--an easier environment for our own folks to operate in, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s easier for us to invest in less platforms versus more platforms. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just a much better environment. As you know, we still have work to do in the up market, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still opportunity there, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s still some opportunity in employer services international as well, but we think these structural tailwinds that first helped us in the down market despite the macro, right, because the macro is really a cyclical issue, but overall excluding cycles, our retention in a down market is up--I said this before, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hundreds of basis points higher than it was 10 to 15 years ago, and now the mid market is at record levels and the NPS scores continue to be at record levels, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we anticipate that going back down. If anything, we see more opportunity there in the mid market, and our plan would be to continue to do that throughout other parts of ADP to add more structural tailwinds to our retention. And if I could add one thing, because you mentioned also price, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a big topic. I know for a lot of companies, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a lot of questions about it, and I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for you to understand strategically at a very high level, regardless of how it flows into the numbers and so forth, our view on price, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said it for a couple of quarters now, is to kind of keep up with inflation, so I want to make sure it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very clear that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not achieving our margin improvements for doing anything that would be unusual, because I think there might be some companies that are trying to make up revenue gaps or margin gaps with price because there is, quote-unquote, cover out there to do that. But I think when you do that, and I think Don has mentioned this before, that we operate in a competitive environment and we look at what competitors are doing and we look at what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the world, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re long term thinkers here, so you should assume that our price increases were in line with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening with inflationary costs and not anything more than that, and not materially less than that. Well, I hope so. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll let Don comment in a moment, but again, just because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been doing this for a long time, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get it out of my mind. The way the recurring revenue model kind of works is we love the 15%, and what you just described really comes through in the numbers. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the difference between our bookings and our losses--our strong retention and our strong bookings, that the net of that contributed more to employer services revenue than ever seen in my tenure as CEO, and that is what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s led to the deceleration you just described in ES revenue, so that net new business growth is really the way to grow the top line. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other factors in there, like pays per control, client funds interest, but that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the core of the business and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really happy with that. The challenge, of course, is that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not forecasting 15% bookings growth again next year, so I would just caution you, too. Now, the good news is that that increase in net new business is in our run rate now, and so we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have to grow by as much the next year in terms of that net new business to further accelerate our revenue growth, but I would just caution you in terms of if you do that kind of math, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to accelerate the revenue growth rate of this company. We just did it and it takes a combination of better retention and higher starts, higher sales and new business starting in the upcoming year, and that 15% really makes it huge difference. But you can see from our guidance that that is not our expectation next year in terms of bookings, and so you will experience hopefully additional acceleration of revenue growth in ES, but not by as much as you had from \u00e2\u0080\u009922 to \u00e2\u0080\u009923. Notwithstanding the fact that, remember, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other things in there, moving parts like pays per control, client funds interest and so forth, some of which will give us tailwinds, some of which may be headwinds. I mean, Don again has, I think, a couple points he could probably make, but I would say as usual, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably some puts and takes. I mean, obviously I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a CEO if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say I think our model is better now than it was before, even though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been through a couple cycles here myself, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m criticizing anything other than myself if I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m saying that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s better than it was before. But we just talked about the structural retention level, so even if we have a little bit of a drag in the down market, and by the way, the down market is a larger percent of our overall business than it was 10, 20 years ago, but still it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s structurally higher by several hundred basis points in and of itself, so even if it goes down a little bit and is a little bit bigger part of our mix, I think our retention is just going to hold up better, I would predict, in terms of--you know, depending obviously on the severity of the recession, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a huge help because the bigger--obviously the portion of the revenues that you retain each year, the less dependency you have on bookings in a recession, which tends to be the most sensitive.  Historically when you look at GDP growth and all of our metrics besides pays per control, bookings is something that can be challenging in a severe recession, which to reiterate, we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see. We read the same things everyone else reads and we know that Fed tightening will lead to a slower economic growth, but we really can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see it in our numbers. Our pays per control number in the fourth quarter was as strong as it was the whole year. When you look at the monthly initial unemployment claims, you look at the room that still is there in labor force participation, you look at the number of job openings in comparison to where it was historically, I just don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see it. There clearly are pockets that are happening. I think as part of readjustments because of COVID that are kind of confusing the landscape and there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly some kind of slowdown underway because it just happens when you have Fed tightening, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not happening in the labor market, at least not yet. The only thing I would add to that is Maria and I have been talking for the last 18 months about how--you know, one of the most important things for our sales organization was really to get productivity at the quota carrier level back to and then exceed from a trend line standpoint where it was, right, so when you think about whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s GDP trend or price trends or anything like that, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to get back to where you were and then you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to get back on that same trend line, otherwise you leave a lot of money on the table, whether it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the economy or ADP\u00e2\u0080\u0099s revenue and bookings growth.  From an attribution standpoint, again this--I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for you to understand this color. We had unbelievable productivity growth, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why I said that this is the best performance I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever seen by our sales force. Clearly some of it is because we were in recovery mode, but sales forces naturally generally have--not that I know, because I was never a sales person, but I guess I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been around long enough to be hopefully an honorary member, but when you tell a sales force, okay, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to grow--we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to grow our headcount by a few percentage points and then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to grow our productivity two or three percentage points, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in a typical year, right, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard in a typical year. When you tell a sales force, you have to grow your productivity close to 20%, even though it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because it went down 20%, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s freaking hard to do, very hard to do psychologically. Anybody who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in sales, I think understands that, and so these percentage growth numbers that we have and the productivity growth numbers that we have, honestly, are incredibly just gratifying, because I really thought this was going to be hard. I was, of course, keeping my poker face on and just telling everybody, we have to do it, we have to do it, and we did it, so most of this growth came from productivity and not from headcount because, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve talked about, we actually had some challenges up until the fourth quarter in terms of achieving our headcount objectives, not by lack of trying, by the way, and not because we were trying to save money, because we were doing everything we could and it was just a difficult labor market. The good news is in the fourth quarter, as Maria has mentioned, we really did quite well and are in a great position headcount-wise now, but the \u00e2\u0080\u009922 story is all about productivity, and that is an unbelievable accomplishment for our sales force, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s across the board. Yes, I think you mentioned--we were having a little trouble catching the entire question, so maybe I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try to give a little bit of color and maybe you can repeat again, or ask us--ask the question again. But I think you said something about the lower end of the enterprise space and where the strength in sales was coming from, etc. I think just to repeat what Maria said, I think it is across the board, but that is one--the reason I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m picking up on it, this is a really good news story for us, so our Workforce Now platform--you know, we made the strategic decision two or three years ago, it makes sense because it fits well in the lower end of the enterprise space, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really been a home run for us there. Against certain competitors, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really very, very effective, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re selling a lot of units in that lower end of the up market space for us. As we continue with the rollout of next-gen HCM, which is really intended for further up market and eventually for global, in the meantime we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re really having a lot of success in the lower end of the up market with our Workforce Now platform. If you want to maybe repeat your question one more time, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll give it another try. And that doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that you should model, or that we modeled everything consistently throughout the quarter, so--because I do have to make a comment on your point that it sounded like you thought we were being aggressive, which would not be typical of us to model 2% to 3% pays per control when everyone is thinking there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to be a recession. I would tell you that the fourth quarter, you saw what our pays per control growth was, and I can tell you that we have visibility into July and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to believe that for the whole year, it would be less than 2% to 3%, but then you can assume that if, for example, the first couple of months at least, since we have some visibility of that already, are in the 6% to 7% range, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of exiting, and you can do the math, right, so you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re probably--this is just to give you color in terms of what some of our assumptions are in our operating plan, because I think Don mentioned maybe a bit of conservatism on the back half. We probably have reasonable continuation of trends, because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the way trends go, on pays per control in the first half, and then you would probably expect the second half of the year to have little to no pays per control growth, or somewhere in that neighborhood.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also hard for us to model a big negative growth on pays per control just because of all the factors we mentioned in the labor market. That doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mean that won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t happen in \u00e2\u0080\u009924 or late in \u00e2\u0080\u009923, or at some point in history, but it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem likely over the course of our fiscal year. But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re clearly expecting some slowdown in the second half. In terms of new business bookings, because obviously--we just want to make sure we answer the question correctly. It will only affect--obviously we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not even talking about migrations yet, even though at some point that will happen-- No. Thank you. Don probably has the details, but I can give you some high level color. Pays per control growth--I know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not asking about historical, but as we gather the data, I just want to tell you that pays per control growth is very strong in employer services international as well, and part of that, of course, is because of what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re coming off of, right, which were these lockdowns and these high unemployment rates across the globe. I would say international has performed similarly, but it is safe to assume that we see probably challenges given what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the macro environment with energy costs and the war and so forth in our international business. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know, Don, if you have-- Don, you should point out that you started working in 1974 when you were 12 years old. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re disclosing it in our 10-K, so we can-- But I think what Don was trying to say, though, about \u00e2\u0080\u009923 is that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clearly a headwind, right, so as we--as you do your modeling and you think about margins, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a headwind not because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an operating performance issue or whatnot, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just because we had a big benefit in \u00e2\u0080\u009922 and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not planning for a big benefit in \u00e2\u0080\u009923, although we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re always hopeful that we will get some benefit. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s historically been our experience, is that we do get some critical reserve release. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s probably not as big in \u00e2\u0080\u009923 as in \u00e2\u0080\u009922, but it might not be as big a headwind as it appears now, just because of the numbers. But I think that stream of revenue, we would generally see it as 100% margin, just to be completely clear. If that  your question, do we apply expenses against those revenues, the answer is I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve--it felt like a trick question because you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve known us for a long time and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been clear for a long--like, on the way down, we always say it 100% hurts us, right, because there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really no expenses that go away when that interest income goes away, so likewise we would want to be transparent and acknowledge that on the way up, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 100% margin. But I wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t sure if it was a trick question or--it sounds like it was. Yes, I think again strategically, and maybe Dany and Don can get more specific on the numbers, but I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t characterize what we did as being out of step with the market. There was a pause for a few months, but our price increases--our intention was that our price increases during COVID were reflective of the inflation environment at that time as well. We did pause for a few months because, timing-wise, we just thought particularly in 2020 that it was inappropriate to be giving clients price increases one or two months into a global pandemic, but we eventually did some price increases but we did very modest price increases, because inflation was near zero for some period of time.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t if that answers it. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m trying to be responsive, but I think in general, we are always trying to remain in step with the market and still be competitive, because our number one goal is to gain market share. The trap that is easy to fall into when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a large company like ours is you can take price and take it higher than maybe you should be. You can usually do that multiple times and you can do that for a while, but it just doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work forever because it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just the law of economics and large numbers, and it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because of competition. So our intention, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for you to understand that strategically is we want to grow and we want to gain market share, and to do that, we have to be competitive in terms of our products, our service, and also our price, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s--so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important when we do pricing actions, either on new business or on our existing book of business, that we remain in line with what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happening in the general market and with our competitors. Thank you. Thank you. I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve--we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very happy with the quarter, as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve said. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure what else I could say, other than what I said about our sales performance, which I think is definitely the best I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in a long time. We talked a lot about our retention and some of the structural issues that are happening there, so it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hard to be more pleased about that. But I do want to reiterate again how happy we are with our organization and our team. First, we started with COVID and all the uncertainty that that created, everybody having to work from home, then we have all these regulatory changes, some of them very positive like the PPP loans, the ERPC that happened across the world, and while we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re then in the middle of that pandemic, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re telling our associates that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to work weekends and nights because we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to keep up with all these regulatory changes and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to help our clients. Then as soon as that starts to abate a little bit, we get this great reshuffling and we start having challenges, which we overcame in terms of being able to add to staffing and so forth, so we asked our associates to once again work harder, put in the extra effort, and every time we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve asked, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come through for us, so--and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come through, more importantly, for our clients. We really do provide critical services across the world to our clients, and it was very, very important for our organization to come through for our clients, and I just want to again thank our associates for making it through so many ups and downs, where we just keep asking for a little bit more and they keep delivering, so I want to thank them once again.  Once again, thank you for your attention and your interest and the great questions, and we look forward to talking again in the next quarter. Thank you."

            "name": "Don McGuire",
            "content": "Thank you Maria, and good morning everyone.  Our Q4 represented a strong close to the year with 10% revenue growth on a reported basis and 12% growth on an organic constant currency basis, ahead of our expectations despite higher than expected FX headwinds from a strengthening dollar. Our adjusted EBIT margin was up 170 basis points, about in line with our expectations as leverage from strong revenue growth overcame higher selling expenses, PEO pass throughs, and growth investments like the sales headcount growth Maria just mentioned, and our robust revenue and margin performance drove 25% adjusted EPS growth for the quarter, supported by our ongoing return of cash to our investors via share repurchases. For the full year, revenue landed at 10% growth. We delivered 90 basis points of margin expansion, offsetting a few different sources of incremental expense over the course of the year, and adjusted EPS grew to $7.01, up about 16%.  For our employer services segment, revenues in the quarter increased 8% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic constant currency basis. The stronger than expected revenue growth was a function of continued outperformance on key metrics like retention and pays per control, and our ES margin increase of 140 basis points was a bit lower than previously planned as a result of growing headcount faster than previously anticipated. For the full year, our ES revenues grew 8% on a reported basis and our ES margin increased 110 basis points.  For our PEO, revenue in the quarter grew 16%, accelerating slightly from Q3. Average worksite employees increased 14% on a year-over-year basis to 704,000 as bookings, retention, and same store pays all continued to perform well. PEO margin was up 260 basis points in the quarter due in large part to favorable workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation reserve adjustments. For the full year, our PEO revenues and average worksite employees both grew 15%, at the high end of our guidance ranges, and our margin expanded 80 basis points.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now turn to our outlook for fiscal 2023, beginning with some overall remarks.  We have on the one hand an inflationary environment that is creating upward pressure on our expense base, and at the same time we recognize there is clearly concern about a potential upcoming global recession, or that we perhaps are already in one. On the other hand, our momentum entering fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 is strong and there are no obvious signs of near term strength, and if the market\u00e2\u0080\u0099s forecast of higher interest rates holds, we are positioned to benefit from a continued rebound in interest income. Our focus for now will be to continue executing on our strategy, and to that end, we have been and will continue to be making investments in headcount where we perhaps didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a chance to last year in a tight labor market, and we also expect to deliver growth that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at or above our medium term annual objectives shared at the November \u00e2\u0080\u009921 investor day. Onto the numbers, beginning with ES segment revenues, we expect growth of 6% to 8% driven by the following key assumptions. First, we expect our ES new business bookings growth to be 6% to 9%, which Maria covered. For ES retention, we finished the year at 92.1%, a touch below last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s record level, and we believe it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prudent to anticipate some further normalization of business levels in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 even while we maintain record retention levels in some of our other business units. Our initial assumption is for a decline of 25 to 50 basis points in ES retention for the year. For pays per control, with employment back near pre-pandemic levels, we anticipate a return to a more typical 2% to 3% growth range. We normally talk about price as contributing 50 basis points to our ES growth rate, but we expect that benefit to be around 100 to 150 basis points this year.  For client funds interest revenue, we expect higher overnight interest rates and higher repurchase rates on maturing securities should combine with our continued balance growth to drive interest income up nicely. Our short funds portfolio, which is invested in overnight securities, will benefit assuming the Federal Open Market Committee increases the Fed funds rate over the course of this fiscal year, and our client extended and long portfolios will benefit as we reinvest maturing securities at an expected rate of about 3.3%. Between those two drivers, we expect average yield to increase from 1.4% in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 to 2.2% in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923.  We expect our client funds balances to grow 4% to 6%, supported by growth in clients, pays per control, and wages, and this is on top of a very robust 19% growth we experienced last year. Putting those together, we expect our client funds interest revenue to increase from $452 million in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 to a range of $720 million to $740 million in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923.  Meanwhile, the net impact from our client fund strategy will increase by a bit less, from $475 million in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 to a range of $675 million to $695 million in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923, and as a reminder, this is the number that impacts our adjusted EBIT. The slightly lower growth here is due to the expected increase in short term borrowing costs which track the Feds fund rate. This borrowing enables us to ladder our portfolio and invest further out on the yield curve than we otherwise would. As we gradually reinvest our maturing securities, this gap between client funds revenue and the net impact from our client fund strategy should reverse and again become positive. Back to the ES revenue outlook, one more factor to consider is FX headwinds. Clearly with the year-over-year parity the dollar with a weaker pound and with about 20% of our ES segment revenue being generated outside the U.S., we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re factoring in a fair amount of FX headwind for fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 of well over 1%. For our ES margin, we expect an increase of 175 to 200 basis points.  This coming year, our expense base will be increasing more than it does in a typical year, in part due to inflationary pressure on our overall wages and in part due to headcount growth, some of which we did late in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922 and some of which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re planning for fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923, but because our margins are benefiting from strong revenue growth outlook, including growth in client funds interest revenue, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re pleased to be able to guide to this strong ES margin outlook. Moving onto the PEO segment, we expect PEO revenues and PEO revenues excluding zero margin pass through to grow 10% to 12%. The primary driver for our PEO revenue growth is our outlook for average worksite employee growth of 8% to 10%. That would represent a bit of a deceleration from last year, but of course we are contemplating much less contribution from same store pays per control in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 compared to fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922. This 8% to 10% growth compares to the high single digit target that we outlined at the investor day in November. We expect our PEO margin to be down 25 to up 25 basis points in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 compared to a strong margin result in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009922. Adding it all up, our consolidated revenue outlook is for 7% to 9% growth in fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 and our adjusted EBIT margin outlook is for expansion of 100 to 125 basis points. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal \u00e2\u0080\u009923 to increase slightly to about 23%, and we expect adjusted EPS growth of 13% to 16% supported by buybacks.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll make one comment on cadence - because we expect year-over-year headcount growth to be more significant early in the year and because the benefit from client funds interest will build as the year progresses, we expect adjusted EBIT margins to be down about 50 basis points in Q1 but then build steadily over the rest of the year. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A. Yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a very good question, so thank you for the question. I think as I mentioned in the remarks and the materials that we distributed, we were able to get our sales organization a little bit more than fully staffed going into the fourth quarter, and that makes us feel really good about the opportunity to step off into \u00e2\u0080\u009923 with a fully staffed team, which is something that, as we mentioned in prior quarters, was a little bit more difficult to do during \u00e2\u0080\u009922, so I think we feel really good about where we are with staffing particularly on the sales side. I would also say that, just following the business model that we have, if you look at the record sales we had particularly late in the fourth quarter, we need to make sure that we have fully staffed implementation resources to get those bookings generating revenue as quickly as they can, so we will be focused on that, and then of course just following through to the year-end process, need to make sure we can service all those additional clients as that time comes upon us in late December-January-February. We can do all those things.  On the other hand, as I referenced and as we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re seeing in the media and elsewhere, everywhere is talk about a recession potentially coming, are we in one, etc. We still do have flexibility of course, and we can certainly temper the addition of headcount and temper our costs more generally should we think that that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s necessary, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s as a result of changes in the macro environment, so I think we still have lots of levers and I think we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve shown historically that we are able to navigate those waters pretty adeptly should that kind of situation arise. Yes, I think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good observation. I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a few things driving it. Of course, we talked about more price than we historically have been able to take, and of course we do have the tailwinds, if you will, from the client fund interest, so. Certainly we need to remember that the reason we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting our interest rates is that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re in a higher inflationary environment, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s driving more cost base in wages. The other aspect is that we have called out, and we typically haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t called out FX in the past, but we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve certainly seen, I think what we would refer to as pretty dramatic changes in FX headwinds in the fourth quarter compared to what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen in typical years, and so we thought that was important to call out. With 20% of our ES revenue being outside of the U.S. and denominated in Canadian dollars, euros, sterling, Australian dollars for that matter, I think all the currencies are essentially down. When you put all that stuff together, it certainly results in a little bit less at the top line dropping through to margins, so that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been our focus. The other thing I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say is that we do have a little bit of conservatism as we look to the back half. We have to take into account all the things we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re reading about and seeing and making sure that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re thinking hard about how to prepare should something happen in the back half of the year, so I think those are the primary drivers, to answer your question. Yes, so Carlos covered off all the main drivers there. Of course, I think just once again I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d go back and mention the FX headwinds we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re experiencing. I think when you add that into the mix, I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d probably get to a place where we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re landing and what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re anticipating guiding to for \u00e2\u0080\u009923. Yes, so Mark, just going back to the first part of your question, you mentioned the deceleration of margin that I mentioned, and of course we talked about the increase in sales headcount specifically because it is meaningful in quarter one of this year, in quarter one of \u00e2\u0080\u009922, so we do think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to have a bit of a drag. There are, of course, some other factors - general inflation, general etc., and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve taken price--Carlos described and took you through our price thinking, which is pretty consistent to what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve discussed over the last number of quarters, so we do expect to see a little bit of deterioration in margin percentage through the first quarter, and I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understood. Then as interest rates continue to--or as interest rates go higher and as we have the opportunity, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to see higher client fund interest for the last three quarters of the year, but overall we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re kind of looking at pretty even top line revenue quarter by quarter through the balance of the year. No big changes at all in terms of growth rates quarter by quarter through \u00e2\u0080\u009923 compared to \u00e2\u0080\u009922, so if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re modeling growth, you can feel be comfortable to model consistent growth across the top lines quarter by quarter. No Carlos, I think those points are valid. Certainly what happens with energy on the continent in particular is going to have some impacts on the results, but beyond that--this is a little bit of the conundrum that we talked about earlier, about where we are versus what people are talking about. So as much as everyone\u00e2\u0080\u0099s predicting a recession, etc., unemployment rates in the euro zone are at 6.1%, which is an all-time low. Unemployment rates in Canada are as low as they were even before I started working, in 1974. Unemployment rates in Australia are at a 50-year low, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got this situation where there seems to be a lot of employment yet all this risk and worry about recession.  To come back to your question, are we a little bit more concerned about what could happen in EMEA in particular as a result of what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on with current prices, etc.? A little bit more concerned, yes. Did we think about that when we put our plans together? To some extent, yes. Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say . Yes, I think for now, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pretty much steady as she goes. I mean, certainly you can see the valuations have dropped across the board. Things that were really expensive in January are still just expensive. Things are still expensive, but they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come down off of historic highs, so there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not exactly what I would call a bunch of bargains out there. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s also not a lot of people who are coming forward looking to sell their properties because prices are down, so I would say it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s steady as she goes and we will continue to do what we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done and look for things that work for us strategically, look for adjacencies that make sense should they arise. But really, steady as she goes, really no change to our overall policy. I guess the short answer is we get adjustments on a regular basis, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been favorable for us. We look at the workers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 compensation experience over a number of years and we get external third parties to do an assessment as to whether or not it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appropriate to book any of those adjustments, and this year we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been fortunate. We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t typically forecast those numbers in any great detail simply because we do have to rely on the experience rating that the insurance companies bring to us, and so without trying to disclose exactly what the numbers were, I would say they were favorable and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to wait as the months go by to see what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to happen in \u00e2\u0080\u009923. Yes, so I think there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s other things going on, of course. We mentioned the inflationary environment, which is why have the higher interest rates. We mentioned the FX headwinds we have, so all things in, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still expecting--we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still very happy and very proud of the operating margin improvements we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting and we think we still have good opportunity for margin improvements ex-client fund interest going forward. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d say that right now, our expectations are for a pretty balanced incremental margin from both of those factors, so we are of course, as we mentioned--you know, we are spending some more money, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re investing in sales headcount, we have higher costs as a result of inflation, some of it is offset by price, but we are letting a substantial amount fall to the bottom line but we are obviously in this for the long term, so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take the opportunity to invest in the business and make sure that we have the right balance between margin growth and preparing ourselves for continued success in the future years."

I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanyal Hussain: Thank you, Michelle, and welcome everyone to ADP's third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our CEO; Maria Black, our President; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. And with that, let me turn it to Carlos.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you, Danny, and thank you everyone for joining our call. We delivered exceptionally strong third quarter results, including revenue that accelerated to 10% growth on a reported basis and 11% growth on an organic constant currency basis, coupled with solid adjusted EBIT margin expansion. The strong outcome on both revenue and margin drove 17% growth in adjusted diluted EPS, well ahead of our expectations. Our clients have had new shortage of challenges in navigating the last 12 months, but through it all not only have they persevere but they have invested in their workforce to better support their employees and continue to grow their businesses. We're proud to support them in these efforts through our leading HCM technology and unrivaled expertise. This quarter, I'll provide high-level commentary on key business drivers, and then Maria will take us through some product and other updates. And as usual, Don will discuss the financials and our updated outlook. Let me start with Employer Services new business bookings. We are very pleased to have delivered another strong quarter of double-digit growth. This was a record level for the third quarter. And as we had hoped when we updated you last quarter, the Omicron variant was not a meaningful factor in our bookings performance, as third quarter growth accelerated from our first half levels towards the high end of our guidance range this quarter. Our clients continue to find tremendous value across our suite of offerings with our PEO and HR outsourcing, international and downmarket businesses, again, leading the way. We're pleased to narrow our ES bookings guidance higher, and we look forward to delivering this double-digit growth for the full year, which should position us well for fiscal 2023. Our employer services retention was also very strong this quarter. As you know, our third quarter is especially important for retention since we typically experience elevated switching with the start of the new calendar year. Accordingly, we were very pleased that rather than decreasing the quarter towards pre-pandemic levels like we anticipated, our retention actually increased further into record territory driven by incredible performance from our mid-market and international businesses, among others. As we've discussed for several quarters, the strong employee and client growth we've experienced have increased the demands on our implementation and service organization. We added to our headcount to keep up with this demand ahead of our busy year-end period. And as a result, we were able to maintain strong overall client satisfaction scores despite ongoing pressure from this elevated demand. With retention having outperformed our expectations so far this year, we believe we are now on pace to hold on to most of last year's retention gains and expect to remain at 92% retention for the year, down very slightly versus last year's record retention level. Moving on to Employer Services pace for control, our clients continue to steadily hire as workers enter or reenter the labor force and our pays per control growth of 7% for the quarter came in better than expected. Clearly, there are a number of factors at play when considering employment growth trends, but strong overall economic activity continues to keep demand for labor high, and we've been pleased to see labor force participation gradually recover over the course of the year. And one last highlight before I turn it over to Maria. Our PEO had another strong quarter with 16% average worksite employee growth and 14% revenue growth. As we've seen all year, growth in our PEO bookings was exceptionally strong as small and midsized businesses increasingly find value in turning over a meaningful portion of their HR function to ADP. And that strong bookings performance, coupled with robust employment growth within the PEO base has driven this very healthy double-digit revenue growth. And now let me turn it over to Maria.\nMaria Black: Thank you, Carlos. It's great to be joining everyone for the call. Also some updates on a few key initiatives we have underway. One key product initiative is the rollout of our new unified user experience. And we made some great progress on this front. Earlier this year, we moved the RUN, iHCM and Next-Gen HCM client bases over to the new UX. Feedback has been strong with clients, especially upbeat about how easy we've made key HCM workflows. In January, we shared, we started the pilot of the new UX to Workforce Now and since then, we've expanded from a handful of clients to over 1,000, early feedback has also been overwhelmingly positive. In this quarter, we began the rollout of the new UX to the ADP Mobile app. The ADP Mobile app is an incredibly important part of the ADP suite with over 10 million active users. It is one of the top five most downloaded business apps in the Apple App Store and is available in over 20 languages. And we're excited to take our 4.7 star average user experience and make it even more insightful, intuitive, and proactive for our users. As we complete the new UX rollout over the coming months. Moving on, data continues to be one of our key differentiators in this quarter, we expanded our data offerings even further, as we launched pilot clients on our new global insight dashboard powered by DataCloud. This dashboard provides our GlobalView and Celergo clients with advanced analytics for their employee populations around the globe, leveraging the same award-winning analytics platform we have scaled across our U.S. mid and upmarket client bases. Last quarter, we mentioned you would hear a bit more about our marketing efforts here at ADP. At our Investor Day in November, I spoke about how for decades, ADP has reached prospects through our powerful direct sales force and how in more recent years, we have enhanced this direct channel with modern selling tools, a growing partner network, and with increased digital advertising. This quarter, we continued to advance our great momentum and expanded our overall brand investment with additional initiatives, including our first major athletic sponsorships, a group of eight impressive professional golfers featured across the LPGA, the PGA and the European Tour who together constitute team ADP. The ADP brand is a powerful asset and has come to be associated with professionalism, insightful and trustworthy data. And the premier technology and service we pride ourselves on, and we believe there's opportunity to continue investing in our brand while also pushing the frontier in digital marketing efforts to support our world-class sales force. And as a final call out, this quarter, we were pleased to host one of our marquee client events, ADP Meeting of the Minds in California, which was back in-person for the first time since 2019. This was our 37th Meeting of the Minds conference. And we took the opportunity to engage deeply with our enterprise clients on the changing world of work. What I love most about this event is as much as we enjoy sharing our perspective with our clients and showing them our latest HCM innovations, we also make the most of this opportunity by listening to and learning from them and having the event back in-person really makes a big difference. The third quarter was a terrific quarter overall, which you can see in our results and in the progress we made on key initiatives, we were recently named one of Fortune\u2019s Most Admired Companies for the 16th year in a row. And we are proud of this honor because it highlights our culture of continuous improvement, our consistency and our focus on being a true partner to our clients. A big thank you to our associates who make this all happen. Now over to Don.\nDon McGuire: Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. For our third quarter, we delivered 10% revenue growth on a reported basis and 11% on an organic constant currency basis. This revenue growth in turn supported adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points, which was much better than the decline we expected. We achieved that margin expansion despite incremental investments in headcount and compensation we discussed last quarter. Through the combination of this strong adjusted EBIT growth, a slightly lower tax rate and a lower share count, we were able to deliver a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Looking more closely at the segment results, our Employer Services revenue increased 8% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic currency basis. ES revenue has been supported all year long by strong retention and pays per control trends. And our double-digit bookings performance has been contributing nicely as well. In Q3, we also started to get a more meaningful contribution from client funds interest through the combination of our 15% client funds balance growth and an average yield that was nearly flat with the prior year. This year-over-year increase in client funds interest contributed about 0.5% to our revenue growth, which is a very nice outcome compared to the last several quarters. ES margin increased 120 basis points, well ahead of our expectations for the quarter and supported primarily by revenue growth. Moving on to the PEO segment. PEO revenue remains very strong and grew 14% in the quarter. Average worksite employee growth is the primary driver to PEO revenue and remained at a very robust 16%, reaching 688,000 average worksite employees for the quarter. We continue to benefit from the strong bookings growth we\u2019ve seen all year long, as well as healthy retention and pays per control growth within the PEO client base. PEO revenue growth is a bit lower than worksite employee growth this quarter, which is fairly atypical, impacting revenue for worksite employee was a mix shift towards WSEs with a slightly lower average wage and lower benefits participation, representing continued normalization back towards a pre-pandemic mix. That said, it\u2019s good to see a recovery in all parts of the workforce in our PEO. PEO margin was flat in the quarter and included higher selling expenses driven by our strong sales momentum. Moving on to our updated outlook for the year. For ES revenues, we are raising our guidance and now expect growth of about 7% up from our previous guidance of about 6%. There are a few drivers behind that increase. We are narrowing our ES bookings guidance higher to a range of 13% to 16% up from 12% to 16% prior. So far this year, we have realized and delivered solid double digit growth. Clearly, there was geopolitical uncertainty in Europe, as well as more general macro uncertainty. But notwithstanding those uncertainties, our outlook contemplates a strong Q4 with growth in the teens and we look forward to delivering a strong finish to the year. We are raising our employer services retention guidance, and now expected to be down only 20 basis points for the year versus our prior expectation of down 40 basis points. Our retention has held up extremely well so far this year, but at a prudence, we are assuming a modest decline in Q4 for the same reasons we\u2019ve outlined all year long. For U.S. pays per control, we\u2019re once again, raising our outlook and now expect 6% to 7% growth versus our prior expectation of 5% to 6% growth driven by the ongoing recovery in the labor force participation combined with steady demand for labor from our clients. We are also raising our client funds interest outlook slightly to a range of $450 million to $455 million up from our prior expectation of $440 million to $450 million. There\u2019s no change to our 18% to 20% balance growth outlook with just a few months remaining in fiscal 2022, the benefit from higher new purchase rates for the recent yield curve shifts is modest. And therefore, we still expect yield to round to 1.4% for the year. Moving on to ES margin. We are raising our outlook to now expect margins to be up 100 to 125 basis points versus up 75 to 100 basis points prior. This increase is mainly driven by the stronger revenue outlook and margin performance in Q3 versus our expectations. Moving on to the PEO. We are narrowing our average worksite employee growth to 14% to 15% versus 13% to 15% prior driven by continued momentum in new business bookings. We are likewise narrowing total PEO revenue to 14% to 15% growth up from 13% to 15% growth prior. And we are raising PEO revenues, excluding zero margin pass-throughs to 15% to 17% growth from 14% to 16% growth prior. For PEO margin, we are raising our guidance to now expect margins to be up 25 to 50 basis points rather than flat to down 50 basis points for the year. That\u2019s driven by an improvement in pass-through expenses, including more favorability from workers compensation compared to our prior outlook. Putting it together for our consolidated outlook, we now expect revenue to grow 9% to 10% up from 8% to 9% prior. For adjusted EBIT margin, we now expect an increase of 75 to 100 basis points, up from 50 to 75 basis points prior. We are making no change to our tax rate assumption. And we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 15% to 17% up from 12% to 14% prior. Before we move on to Q&A, I wanted to quickly touch on fiscal 2023. We\u2019re still going through our planning process. And so we won\u2019t be providing any specifics this time. Clearly, there are going to be some unique puts and takes for fiscal 2023, but overall, we feel very good about the momentum in the business and we will remain focused on our medium-term growth objectives that we laid out at our November Investors Day. We look forward to providing our outlook next quarter. Thank you. And I\u2019ll turn \u2013 now turn it back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Peter Christiansen with Citi. Your line is open.\nPeter Christiansen: Thank you and good morning and congrats on the solid execution this quarter, guys. Carlos, I had a question about for a number of quarters, we talked about ASO, HRO becoming a larger contributor to ES. Just wondering if you had any thoughts on how that\u2019s contributing to the stickiness of retention at this point? And then as a follow-up, given all the UI upgrades you\u2019ve given across the platform, how does that translate to growth to add-on services? I\u2019m thinking even things like pay wisely, those sorts of ancillary value-added products. Thank you.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Sure. I\u2019ll take the first part and I\u2019ll let Maria takes the second part. On the HRO business within ES, which as you know, is kind of our full outsourcing solutions or without the co-employment, the growth there has been quite robust on bookings, which obviously then is driving really robust growth in revenues. The interesting thing about that business, I mean, you have to \u2013 you almost have to call out. It\u2019s nice to be able to do it publicly, just unbelievable execution because in our business, when you get that kind of growth, that quickly, it\u2019s very, very hard to manage. But somehow they\u2019ve managed to stay ahead into terms of headcount hiring for both implementation and service. And the business is just really performing incredibly well. Retention rates are holding up. Not just holding up, I think they are up versus the prior year, which was already a strong year. And I would say contributing to the overall improvement in retention and stickiness. So I would say that that is probably \u2013 I would get in trouble for saying this, because then I offend all the other businesses, but that\u2019s got to be one of the star performers. Now the PEO obviously isn\u2019t doing incredibly well. Also and you can see that as a separate segment, it\u2019s a little harder to see the HRO business. It\u2019s also getting big. I think if I\u2019m not mistaken, it\u2019s \u2013 probably never publicly disclosed it, but it\u2019s getting close to $1 billion in revenue. So that\u2019s a pretty solid business with again, without \u2013 I\u2019m probably not right to give you too much detail, but revenue growth is strong double digits, very strong double digits with a two in front of it, let\u2019s say. And bookings growth is incredibly robust as well, retention is strong. Just really performing very well.\nMaria Black: With respect to the new user experience. So I mentioned a bit about it during my prepared remarks, very excited, obviously about the impact of the user experience across the entire portfolio. In terms of what it\u2019s going to do with respect to attach, I think you mentioned wisely and other attach. It\u2019s hard to tease out specifically the impact of the new user experience at this point in the quarter or even for the year as it relates to any material impacts to bookings or to attach. However, we definitely believe in what we\u2019ve developed and the impact that\u2019s going to make. So just to give a tiny bit more color. The new user experience is really based on a research driven design. That research driven design included our clients, as well as our prospects to create a user experience that\u2019s very action-oriented and it\u2019s navigation. What that means specifically is the ability to move through the process payroll, if you will or to your question, the ability to buy and attach in a very action-oriented navigation, which means you don\u2019t really need to know what\u2019s next in order to move through it. It also leverages artificial intelligence as well as machine learning to create a very personalized experience for the buyer or the user, if you will. So that it remembers how the specific individual likes to navigate through the system and serves it up that way in following subsequent sequences of usage. So the other part that we\u2019re very excited I mentioned rolling out the new user experience across the ADP mobile app. The mobile experience, one of the things that will really become a competitive advantage for us is the fact that the mobile experience will be not just for the end user such as that person that would actually purchase wisely, but also for the practitioner. And so a fully web-enabled user experience using the new user interface will certainly lend itself to a better competitive advantage for us in the future. And so as you can tell by my commentary very excited what this is going to do for us both as it relates to our sellers being able to demo and gain volume there, as well as our buyers and clients being able to engage in something a lot more user friendly, so that we can attach more business.\nPeter Christiansen: Thank you. Thank you, both. Congrats again, on the solid result.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open. If your telephone is muted, please unmute.\nTien-tsin Huang: Forgive me. I\u2019m sorry about that. Hope you can hear me now. Great results for sure. It looks like you\u2019re taking some share again. On the PEO side, I just want to make sure I understood the PEO revenue growth coming in beneath WSE growth. I know you said it was unusual. Some of it was benefits participation and salary driven. But just trying to understand is that more of a mean reversion change that you\u2019re talking about? Or is there a quality sort of focus that maybe we should honing in? I\u2019m just trying to better understand that trend and if it might persist for some time.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Listen, I\u2019m glad for the question. And I\u2019m also glad for the answer, right? Because mean reversion is my favorite term in business because when you get into large businesses and large economies, it\u2019s a powerful force in the universe. And that\u2019s exactly what it is. If you remember, this happened with some of the data that was reported by the Fed and by us in terms of employment. That in the initial stages of the pandemic, the jobs that went away the most quickly in terms of quantity were kind of lower wage jobs that in general don\u2019t have high benefits participation rates. Even though our PEO is generally white collar to gray collar, we experienced the same thing there in the PEO. So ironically at that time, it looked like our benefits per employee \u2013 worksite employee were rising, but it was really because of the averages and because of the mix shift. And now we have this mean reversion where even though the white collar jobs are growing and wages are growing, like everything is going exactly as you would want and expect in the PEO. You have this unusual thing because of the pandemic with a lot more jobs coming back that are people who don\u2019t have benefits. So it makes the benefits revenue grow slower than the worksite employee number. But it has nothing to do with any kind of policy change or change in kind of our philosophy or it\u2019s really just a re-normal or a normalization back in my opinion to where we were before. We\u2019re trying to assess kind of how long that takes and it\u2019s probably another quarter or two. There\u2019s a second factor that I think that\u2019s contributing to this, which is that state unemployment rates are coming in a little bit lower than we had expected because some states because of the strong employment market, even though they initially raised unemployment rates, because they thought that were going to have big problems in terms of people filing for unemployment. Obviously now what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s going in the other direction. And a few large states have actually lowered unemployment rates. That\u2019s not a \u2013 it\u2019s a factor. It\u2019s not a huge factor. I think that the mix shift issue is mathematically and this mean reversion is 95% of the explanation. By the way, we don\u2019t necessarily mind it one way or the other, because as you know, we treat benefits revenue as a pass-through. So there\u2019s really no profit and no margin. So it\u2019s really not relevant for us in terms of how we manage the business. Other than we have to explain it to obviously our sales community.\nTien-tsin Huang: Yes. Thank you for the complete answer. It\u2019s really helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open.\nBryan Bergin: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Question around bookings. So you cited an acceleration toward the high end of the range in 3Q and you were tracking below that in the first half of the year. So I\u2019m curious, what were the key drivers of that better performance you saw in 3Q? Was it larger deals that were converting or some improvements in sales force productivity trends? And then just on the outlook for the fiscal year, it sounds like you are confident that momentum here is carrying through as well as, I guess, the removal of potential Omicron conservatism. So I just wanted to clarify if that was fair.\nMaria Black: Fair enough. We did see strength in the third quarter. As you mentioned, we saw strength that was in line with the higher end of our full year guidance in the third quarter specifically. So an accelerated result. We expected that and we delivered that. We did see strength in our down market businesses. So specifically the RUN platform sales as well as retirement services. We also saw strength in our international business. And then last but not least, I think Carlos mentioned during his prepared remarks, the strength that we saw in PEO booking with the entire HRO portfolio, which is what\u2019s reported in employer services did have specific strengths. So again, that\u2019s the down market, RUN, retirement, international and the employer services, HRO that\u2019s where we saw the strength in terms of how we feel stepping into the fourth quarter. In terms of end quarter, the strength that we saw was actually delivered toward the end of the quarter, if you will, in March. And that really gave us the confidence to narrow our guidance heading into the fourth quarter and feel optimistic as we step into the fourth quarter with respect to the overall macroenvironment. And so you mentioned the Omicron that we noded to last quarter. We didn\u2019t see that materialize. And as we sit here today, the economic tailwinds that we see in the market, the challenges that businesses are facing with the increased complexity of new legislation and the tight labor market. There are a lot of things that are out that are giving us the confidence that we will continue to execute in the fourth quarter. And as such, we felt it right to narrow the guidance range to the 13% to 16% for the full year outlook.\nDon McGuire: And just as a reminder, when we talk about bookings, I think Maria mentioned it, and I\u2019m sure all of you remember that we really talk about ES bookings. So a couple years ago that we changed our approach to disclosures because we thought that disclosures in the PEO were better in a format where we really talked about growth of worksite employees. It\u2019s very easy to kind of do the math in the PEO when you talk in those terms. But to be crystal clear, if PEO bookings were included in overall bookings, they would have been meaningfully higher for ADP.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And I know you don\u2019t want to quantify fiscal 2023 outlook yet. I\u2019ll give this a shot. What are some of the puts and takes we should be thinking about for next year? Anything you want to call out as it may relate to comps or dynamics from this fiscal year that may not necessarily carry forward?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes. I think that first of all, no specifics for 2023, we\u2019re going to wait until the next earnings call we have before we give more color on 2023. But as I said earlier, we\u2019re very comfortable with the fundamentals and we think we\u2019re in a good spot. We\u2019ve overcome some of the challenges that we referenced last quarter in terms of making sure we\u2019re appropriately staffed for the bigger business that we now have. We did that well going into the busiest quarter of the year. So that\u2019s all in good shape. Certainly, you guys are probably better at the numbers than me on what\u2019s the potential impact from flow balances, et cetera. Certainly, it\u2019s pretty clear that we will have higher client fund interest next year. However, how much, we\u2019re not quite sure yet, even though we\u2019re seeing rates go up, certainly there\u2019s lots of volatility in the rates. There\u2019s certainly lots of things going on. But I\u2019ll come back to the way I ended my prepared remarks and that was that we very much will be mindful of what we share with everybody at the Investor Day in November. And we will make sure that we have those targets in mind, as we prepare when we get ready to release more information on 2023.\nDon McGuire: And it\u2019s a non-GAAP term, but it\u2019s safe to say that client funds interest will be up a lot.\nBryan Bergin: All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nEugene Simuni: Thank you. Good morning. I\u2019ll start with a macro level question. So ADP obviously has its finger on the pulse with very large slides of the U.S. economist. So it\u2019s always very interesting to hear you guys perspective on kind of real time read of what\u2019s going on across the different pockets of your client base, especially now that we\u2019re experiencing kind of volatile macroenvironment. Would you mind providing us with a little bit of that commentary what do you see in today across your client base markets of strength and weakness?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Sure. As you know, obviously our commentary is generally focused on the labor markets. Like this morning, I was hearing reports about what\u2019s happening with consumer spending, which is quite robust that obviously ends up having an impact on the labor markets, because people who are in the service sector or people who are serving consumers end up hiring people in order to fulfil that demand. But generally speaking, our comments are really around the labor markets. And as you can see from our pays per control growth, some of which is related to the previous question about comparisons, right? Like the comparisons are easier and they will get harder next year in terms of percentages. But the percentages don\u2019t matter as much as the absolute numbers, right? And the absolute numbers are strong, I think are robust. And I think as we alluded to the labor market is almost fully recovered. We obviously keep an eye also on things like GDP, GDP growth. I mean, absolute GDP dollars have already surpassed pre-pandemic levels. And they\u2019re kind of in line to get back to trend growth or exceed trend growth on a real basis, right? Because you have to factor in obviously the fact that we have some higher inflation now. I mean, our perspective generally is that the economy is very strong, like based on the things that we\u2019re looking at in our business. But we obviously live in the real world that we have to think about the next quarter or two, but also about 12 months from now and 24 months from now. And Finance 101 would tell you that increase in interest rates that are expected from the Fed and that have already been priced in, which are helping our client fund interest on the two year, five year, seven year and 10 years, I think will all slow at some point the economy, which is the intention, I think of the federal reserve to get inflation under control. Having said all that, you have to make your own decisions on whether or not that will be navigated appropriately to a \u201csoft landing\u201d. But we had 10 years from 2011 through or call it 2010 through 2020 before, right before the pandemic of what I would call relatively, historically speaking reasonable growth in GDP call it 2%, 2.5% GDP growth, gradually recovering employment. So, if we go from 3% or 5% GDP growth, the 2.5% or 2%, we like that. And I think we\u2019ve delivered some pretty outstanding results for all stakeholders during that kind of period of time. So we would not like a recession, just like no one else would like a recession. But I think if you believe that the best of is behind us that doesn\u2019t necessarily need that things are not going to be good going forward. Because we \u2013 all the indicators we\u2019re seeing right now are really strong underlying labor markets. And we also have in the U.S. an administration that will be in the seat for another call it three years, despite what happens in the midterms that is, generally more favorable towards employment regulation and \u2013 and that, I think, is a favorable tailwind for our business as well in terms of just on a macro \u2013 on a very macro level. So I think we like the environment. If the best scenario for us, frankly, which would be a homerun is that growth gradually slows not to the point where there's a recession, but where interest rates stay at the rates that they're at, particularly like kind of the three to five and the seven years, and that really is a pretty large tailwind for us from a bottom line standpoint.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Got it. Thank you. Very, very helpful. And then quickly for my follow-up, staying with the macro theme, inflation is obviously running high, so maybe for Don. Can you give us a quick overview of how inflation you think influenced impacted your results this quarter? What were the puts and takes in the P&L from inflation?\nDon McGuire: Yes. So we've done a couple of things over the last quarter, as we said, we were going to on the last call and we did an off-cycle salary increase to make sure that we kept our associates happy and whole. So that was positive. We also had some bonus programs and some sales conditions, accrued programs that were certainly anticipated and booked in the quarter. So we are \u2013 from a cost side, we were able to do those things and still deliver the improved margins. So we think that was very positive for us to do. The other side of this, of course, is price increases, and the two aspects of the price increases. Certainly, we haven't yet \u2013 although planned, we haven't yet initiated large price increases with our installed base. We will make sure that we do those things accordingly, reflecting inflation and most importantly reflecting to make sure that our clients still get great value from us in a competitive environment. And what we did do though and we signaled this in the last call as well, we have increased the pricing on some of our new offers, our new offer sales we \u2013 sales we had in the last quarter. But that's having a very minimal impact on Q3 and certainly won't have an enormous impact on the full year either. So we are making sure that we're focused on pricing both in the base and with new opportunities, new prospects and making sure that we're adjusting our wage levels to keep our employees and deliver the good service that we've delivered that is contributing to the high retention rate we have.\nCarlos Rodriguez: And the only other thing that I would add that we may not always directly linked to inflation as I am beating the dead horse here, but the client funds interest, obviously, inflation is what's driving these higher interest rates. It also happens to also drive higher balances. A lot of our balances are driven by our tax business, but wages, some of those taxes capped, but for example federal withholding taxes are not necessarily capped. So the more people get paid, the more taxes we collect and have to remit to various agencies and wages are a portion of our float balances. And clearly, there is an impact from there. Overall wage inflation, forget about our own inflation that Don is referring to, but the inflation in our client base in terms of their own \u2013 the wages of their employees is really driving \u2013 is helping our balance growth for sure. But more importantly, it's obviously driving a belief that interest rates need to rise rather rapidly, which is now being already factored in into \u2013 even though the Fed controls obviously fed funds rate you can all see what's happening with the one year, two year, three year, five year and what the expectation is for and that's all related obviously directly to inflationary expectations.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Got it. Very comprehensive. Thank you very much guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKartik Mehta: Good morning. I was just hoping maybe to get a little bit more on the pricing comments you made if you look at pricing and compared to what you anticipate getting and compared it to historical levels, what will be a good way to \u2013 are you able to kind of quantify that or maybe just a good way to think about the opportunity ADP has going forward?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think the safest thing for us to say right now because, as Don said, we really haven't finalized that yet as we have not finalized our 2023 operating plan. So I think Don was giving you kind of directional color, which is 100% accurate. We've been doing a lot of work, and Maria and the team have been doing a lot of work on what's the appropriate pricing policy, if you will. Don mentioned the fact that on new business, it's relatively easy because that's something that we control timing-wise, whereas price changes to the book of business, we have a cycle that we go through, and we decided not to do anything unnatural or out of cycle. So that that decision is still kind of in front of us. But I think Don used the word competitive, we do not live in a vacuum. And so, we are going to do what's appropriate based on what's happening with inflation, but also with what's happening with competitors. So we're going to be watching very carefully what everyone is doing from the \u2013 obviously from the sidelines since we obviously don't have any direct insight into what our competitors are doing. But you get competitive signaling and you get hearsay here and there. So we're looking at all those things, but it's safe \u2013 I guess the best way to describe it is whatever our price increase had been historically and it was probably consistent for almost 10 years in terms of kind of what we were telling you in terms of what it represented in as a percent of revenue. It's safe to say that that's going to be higher. And you kind of have to draw your own conclusions if inflation was 2% and now it's 4% to 5%, you could infer because our costs not just our wage cost, which Don alluded to, we've already had to kind of build in higher costs for our own associates. We have other costs. We have other services and other things that are being provided to us that are like every other company and we got to cover those costs. I think our philosophy is we would like to be in line with what's happening in the market.\nKartik Mehta: And then just, Don, one last question. Just on the float portfolio, any thoughts about changing how you manage it or going shorter or longer, just because of where rates are and the volatility at least in the near-term?\nDon McGuire: We get this question often. And at the end of the day, we keep coming back to the same thing, and that's the safety diversification and liquidity of what we invest in. And so, it's unlikely we're going to make any major changes to the way we invest funds. I think we want to be \u2013 we want to certainly do well with our portfolio, but we also want to be prudent and so we'll continue to do that. So there's really no impeditive or imperative for us to make any changes to the way we've been managing those funds in the near, mid to long term.\nCarlos Rodriguez: And I think it's also safe to say that our philosophy is that we run an HCM technology services company. And this is a really nice side benefit that for however long we've been in this business, we have this float income, and it goes up and down based on interest rates and the economy and so forth. And I think compared to ten years ago, it's a much smaller portion of our bottom line. And so, that is both good and bad, right. I would have enjoyed my life and my tenure a lot more had interest rates not been as low as they were for as long as they were. But having said all that, it puts us in a much better position where it's much more clear now that ADP's core earnings are not driven by fluctuations in interest rates. And the reason we ladder our portfolio is primarily because as Don said about safety and security and liquidity, but it's also because philosophically we're not trying to gain the market, we're not trying to time the market, we are running an HCM technology services business, and that's our focus.\nKartik Mehta: Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Nice results on margins in the quarter. You guys beat our number pretty handily despite, I think, a headcount increase that \u2013 could you help us think through the puts and takes with that performance in terms of sales productivity or other drivers? And also sort of how you're thinking about those primary levers for margin expansion as we move forward?\nDon McGuire: Yes. So as I said a few minutes ago, we're very happy with the ability to hire quite a number of service implementation people going into this \u2013 going into the third quarter because that's obviously the busiest time of our year. So we made sure that we got as many people in as we could and we did quite well. And I think the retention rates are suggesting that we've continued to do a good job on behalf of our clients because they're sticking around. So very, very positive. Going forward, I think as we \u2013 once again, you're coming back to the plan a little bit that we're still putting together. But certainly, as we continue to grow, we'll continue to make sure that we staffed accordingly. And really not too much color to add there other than we've been successful at the hiring as we said we would be and it's not going to \u2013 it's not going to change dramatically and have any different impact on our overall margin than what we anticipated. And I don't know the sales continue to go very well, doing very well. We've talked the last time about productivity and things reverting back to means. And I don't know, Maria, if you want to make a comment about sales productivity, we've had good results.\nMaria Black: Yes, happy to add there. The investments that we're making into the overall sales ecosystem continue to be very balanced. So it's really all about the seller enablement. So as mentioned many times, we have this world-class sales force that's out there directly distributing our products and we enable them with an entire ecosystem of modern seller tools. That's definitely where we spent the last couple of years investing, especially as clients continue to pivot between wanting in-person and virtual. So seeing great productivity there, also seeing investments in brand and marketing and advertising. That's a big piece of the balanced approach that we take. And again, I don't see huge shifts in terms of the balanced approach that we're taking, but it is really an area that we continue to invest. I should mention to in that laundry list, digital advertising. So that's an area that we continue to see significant performance year-on-year in our down market and our mid-market in terms of the execution there. So all of these things are really about continuing the approach that we've had to enable the strong sales execution that we've seen this year and going forward.\nDon McGuire: One last thing on margins that I would add because I think it's something that we've been for years talking about is just a reminder that the overall ADP margin does get impacted by the mix of PEO and the growth rate of PEO compared to Employer Services. So from a GAAP standpoint, we do include zero margin pass-throughs and we believe that's the right approach and I think the SEC believes that's the right approach. But I think clearly, if you took out zero margin pass-throughs from the PEO, you'd have a very different margin profile of that business and hence you would have a very different margin overall for ADP. I only raised that because it is important to look at those two separately because you do have a mix shift issue that happens that doesn't necessarily tell you what the underlying strength of those businesses are. And that sometimes helps us in terms of our story, sometimes it hurts us, but it's the appropriate thing to guide you to, to look at. Because in this case, for example, the underlying margin is much higher because of the pressure that we're getting from zero margin pass-through as a result of that mix.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. That's very helpful. And could you comment on or update us on your sort of M&A and/or capital allocation strategy? And just in the context of the current macro backdrop, are you seeing the opportunity, M&A opportunities change? Or how are you framing that up internally in terms of your priority \u2013 prioritization?\nDon McGuire: Yes. So I'll just start with opportunities. Certainly, as always, there is no shortage of things floating around and things to assess and review, et cetera. So we continue to do that. But as Carlos has said and we've said over a long period of time, if we're ever going to do anything other than a tuck-in here and there, which we had \u2013 we did have one in Q2. But other than tuck-in here and there, we're very disciplined in making sure that we're just not adding additional products where we already have products and making sure that we can keep our portfolio as clean as possible. So we continue to look at opportunities and evaluate things and we will make the right choices when the time \u2013 should the time come. On the \u2013 just in terms of our overall philosophy, I don't think we've changed our philosophy. We continue to be committed to the share buybacks that we've committed to dividends in the 55% to 60% range, although we were a little bit higher. I think we were 61% last year, but we're committed to that 55% to 60% range. the \u2013 even though the markets are off, just back to opportunities for M& a little bit more, even though the markets are off a little bit, and I think that the valuations that are out there are still quite high, the expectations at a number of people, who are looking to do something with their current operations, their expectations really haven't adjusted to or reflected what we're seeing in the market. So it's not any easier yet, but we will watch, we will evaluate. And if we see something or things that make sense, we'll do. It's appropriate.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it very well. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to dig in a little bit on the bookings commentary. Can you talk a little bit about with RUN? You saw strong growth there. How much of that was new businesses versus competitive takeaways? And how would you characterize the competitive takeaways? Are they from your biggest competitor in Rochester? Or are you seeing more from locals and regionals that haven't been able to keep up with the technology changes? Just any sort of depth there? And then can you also talk a little bit about the retirement service solutions that you have and what you're seeing there? And lastly, can you discuss a little bit what you're seeing with regards to Workforce Now and the mid-market?\nMaria Black: So happy to be the one to start here in terms of the strength in bookings. So specifically to RUN, Mark, I think in terms of the commentary around the competitors in Rochester and others, what I would say there is our continued focus on competitive takeaways has not waned. In terms of the strength of actual RUN sales and bookings performance, it's partially anchored in the amount of new business formations that we've continued to see. And so, there is definitely strength there, but certainly not for a lack of interest in the competitive side of the house. To touch on retirement services for a minute as well since you asked about that, I would say there's definitely tailwinds there in terms of attach specific to our RUN portfolio. And so as you're aware, significant legislative changes that have happened in the retirement environment state by state, and that's yielded a tailwind for us in terms of the offer that we have and certainly that makes an impact in terms of our ability to sell new logos as well as competitive takeaways because the combination of RUN and retirement and that in this type of an environment is an incredibly compelling to compete out there in the market. So I don't know, Carlos, if you have anything else to add to that.\nCarlos Rodriguez: No, I mean, we try to stay away from obviously any kind of \u2013 making comments about specific competitors, but I would say that specifically in SBS, we do watch this kind of balance of trade very carefully. And I think \u2013 I talk about it every quarter in terms of it's important to me, like one of the most important things for us in terms of long-term sustainability, and durability of our business is market share is really being able to grow units. We also love share of wallet and we love to sell additional business, et cetera, but that's important to us. And at least the figures that we're seeing in terms of our large national competitors, our balance of trade remains positive and improved in the third quarter versus the second quarter. So that to me tells me that I think we're still I think in a good place competitively and that we're doing all the right things, but having said that it's a very competitive market. There's no question about that. And everyone, I think has including some of our national competitors that have good products and good go-to-market strategies. And we are in the trenches every day competing in trench warfare with some of those competitors, we feel pretty good based on the data that we keep track of that we are doing well in terms of balance of trade and also in terms of market share.\nDon McGuire: And Mark, you asked about Workforce Now bookings. So we shared color on some of this already, but in addition to the HRO business, which is doing really well and uses Workforce Now. And then the PEO business, which also uses Workforce Now, there's just the mid-market HCM solution, we didn't call it out, but that also did very well double-digit growth.\nCarlos Rodriguez: And I think the other last one you asked about was retirement services. That business, as you probably know has some significant tailwinds because of regulatory changes that are going to get, they're going to become potentially GaelForce wins, in terms of with a new, I think it's called SECURE 2.0 or because I think the first one was the SECURE Act looks like it's going to make its way through Congress with bipartisan support and the first wave and the first version of that has already created some strong demand. In addition to what was already happening at the state level, where several states were requiring small businesses to mandatorily required to provide a retirement plan. So all those things are tailwinds for that business and that would be one of those businesses that I would describe as doing incredibly well, but trying to keep its head above water to meet demand. It's a good problem to have, trust me like I've been around long enough to know these are \u2013 this is a good problem to have. But it's still a problem. And so we're busy adding resources and trying to be appropriately staffed in our RF business, because it's definitely a growth engine.\nMark Marcon: Can you size it Carlos, in terms of \u2013 I mean, we're aware of the becoming GaelForce wins. Just wondering how meaningful it's going to end up being to you on the whole?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I would say just general range. So you have some sense it's smaller than the HRO business, for example. So you shouldn't assume that we have $1 billion business, so you don't start getting too many images of grandeur. But it's a big business, call it maybe somewhere around half-ish of that business. I don't know, Danny, before I get into trouble, hundreds of millions of dollars. But growing, I think also at one of the faster rates, I think in terms of our businesses here and both for bookings and for revenue.\nMark Marcon: Great. And then the follow up is just, Carlos, you mentioned your non-GAAP description in terms of interest income on the float for next year, how much of that, when we take a look at the Analyst Day discussion and the margin discussions. We typically look at the margin expansion ex-float, how much of the float would you let flow through? I know you aren\u2019t giving us the 2023 guidance, but just philosophically, how are you thinking about that?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, first of all, philosophically, we don't hide anything. So as you know, there's a nice little schedule that we include that allows everyone to do the math. And so next quarter, I'm sure you're going to do the math. And you'll ask us how come you are or aren't allowing X percent to flow through because the math is actually fairly straightforward. We give you the balances that are maturing in that year, because since we ladder the only relevant issue is really what's maturing as well as new money invested in that year, which is what benefits from the higher rates since we hold to maturity. And you'll know we'll give you a forecast of what our balance growth is going to be. And we'll also give you a forecast of what yields are going to be in the next year. So you'll have all that math and it'll be very easy to do. And then what you'll have to do is quiz us on what the other side of the ledger in terms of what are the other factors in terms of that led to the final reported or in that case guided net income figures or EBIT figures. And I think one of the things that's changed from Investor Day is that there's no question that, interest rates are way up and client funds interests \u2013 our forecast for client funds interest would be much higher because you can do the math, just like we can, the other \u2013 the variable that we want to take another quarter to make sure that we think through and that we finalize our plans before we communicate is that inflation is also way up in multiple ways, including on wages as Don alluded to, right. So when we had Investor Day, we had not yet taken this action of an off-cycle merit increase or wage increase, we had not yet which we are now fully accrued for some of our incentive bonuses, which are driven primarily by performance, but come in handy when you are competing for talent and trying to hold on to talent. And so those are all things that we have to kind of weigh now. And then the last factor being, I think Don talked about price increases, where does that finally land will also have an impact. So, there's a few more moving parts then I think is typical for us. And I think it's important for us to make sure we add it all up and rack it all up. But one thing I can guarantee you is you will have transparency.\nMark Marcon: Always appreciate that. Thank you, Carlos.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMihir Bhatia: Good morning. This is Mihir on for Jason. Thank you for taking a question. I wanted to ask about the competitive intensity and pricing actions. Maybe just talk a little bit about the pricing and promotional environment that you're seeing currently. Are we back at pre-pandemic levels in the pre-pandemic trends, any changes, worth calling out in the mix or aggressiveness of competitors and particular segments even, I know you compete across a lot of different segments, so anything you can help us there?\nMaria Black: Yes. So Carlos alluded to the competitive intensity. I think you called it trench warfare and that's certainly the case. I think in terms of being back to pre-pandemic levels, with respect to pricing and promos, we're definitely seeing the competitive intensity that would be reflective of prior years, both as it relates to the trench warfare as well as the pricing element of it. So I think it's fair to assume that it's still very competitive. I think that's part of the reason that as we think about our price increases whether it's on the new business side or on the existing client base, we're being incredibly thoughtful market-by-market, call it country-by-country, segment-by-segment, product-by-product to ensure that we continue to remain thoughtful in terms of the overall price value equation that does keep us remaining in a competitive pricing environment. So I would say that the intensity has not waned. It continues and very formidable competitors out there, and we're confident that we continue to win in the market and that we continue to take a balanced approach on the price value equation.\nMihir Bhatia: Great. Thank you. And then just maybe turning to the growth in average worksite employees, can you talk about what is driving the strength you're seeing there? Is it in particular verticals? Is it broad based, any additional color you can provide there? Thank you.\nCarlos Rodriguez: I mean, I think probably the biggest picture, the answer is no, there's no specific verticals or whatnot. We're too big and too diversified to really \u2013 it's not geographic or verticals or all that. It's basically very strong bookings with very good retention and also growth of the client base. This pays per control that we talk about in Employer Services, you have the same phenomenon in the PEO where the clients themselves are recovering, right and hiring at a faster rate than they would have been because they had either shrunk or hadn't hired during the pandemic. And so that is a tailwind also for the PEO, but the biggest factors are sales minus losses. And then what's happening with the base, which is obviously strong.\nMihir Bhatia: Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one last question and it comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to follow up on a question and it has to do with the competitive intensity, but I guess, previously you talked about, you had some expectation for slight retention deterioration, but that isn't playing out. And in fact, it seems like your outlook is improving. You mentioned mid-market and international are main contributors, but are you seeing anything also in terms of business closures in the down market that's performing better, or any other contributors that are helping out there?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think the best way to describe it, that by the way, was all accurate like we're really happy with international, but also in particular, the mid-market, I think we kind of underestimated as usual, there are multiple moving parts. So you had the pandemic at work. And so we were looking at kind of a historical trends and thoughts, there would be some normalization within the mid-market, but we also had forgotten that right before the pandemic, not right before but 12 to 18 months before the pandemic, we completed our migrations onto one single platform, which is our modern Workforce Now platform, huge process improvement initiatives that were led by John Ayala and the team there that really improved the underlying strength of that business, right. So then you get into the pandemic and you get that noise. Now you come out of the pandemic and there's no scientific way to pull all that apart, but it does feel like our mid-market business has a new floor, if you will, or a nut floor is not the right way to describe it, but a new level of retention that's higher than it was before, that's at least right now, the way it looks in our hope going forward, so that's really good news. The other item on the out of business that you're mentioning, which is really more of a down market question, we again our big subscribers to the school of common sense, and it's playing out kind of the way we expected, because if you look at the reported level of bankruptcies from government figures, they're pretty flat, but that really is not the way the small business market works that, everyone declares bankruptcy, like some people get into business and they stop their business and they never declare bankruptcy. So that is a good proxy and it's one indication, but it's not the only one. And so we have seen some normalization in that down market business because of what we call non-controllable losses, right, which would include out of business bankruptcies, all of the above. It's a big enough factor in that segment that it's impossible to believe that it wouldn't normalize, which is why we planned the way we did. The good news is that it hasn't normalized as fast as we thought. And the other part of our business, the controllable losses have performed better than we expected. And so net-net, we are in better shape than we thought, but just because you have the second best retention you've ever had, doesn't mean that it isn't down from the previous year. And so I just wanted to be crystal clear on that because others may have a different perspective on which would defy. I think finance one-one-one theories and so forth because the number of \u2013 the percentage of losses related to the economy and so forth are just significant in the down market. And so when you have this unbelievable tailwind, when you think about the amount of stimulus that was put in with PPP loans and so forth and stimulus checks, remember some of these small businesses are just like consumers, they're one person companies, or five person companies. And when they get a stimulus check, that's like a stimulus check going to their company, that stuff is all coming out of the system and interest rates are going up. It will normalize unfortunately, but you see the outcome net-net for us, which is still incredibly gratifying and way above what we would've expected.\nDon McGuire: Just to clarify that, that second best comment James was with respect the down market only. Overall, it was an all-time high.\nJames Faucette: Yes, thanks for that. And then so does that \u2013 so should we interpret it then to mean like, as far as that we should still expect some deterioration particularly as that down market normalizes, because that hasn't happened maybe as fast as you thought, but the drivers are still there, whereas on the mid-market you're feeling better that your new platform can actually help prevent or improve that retention versus what you thought. So you kind of have one thing that's permanent and one that's still to happen and net-net, there may be still some deterioration, but not as much as you thought, is that a fair assessment?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think that is a fair assessment that you should stand by for further details next quarter for next calendar \u2013 next fiscal year, because I think we gave you enough color. What you just described is exactly what we expect to happen for the fourth quarter and you see the outcome in terms of our overall guidance for retention. But I think what's more important for you guys is I hope is not just next quarter, but the next year. And I think we'll have another several months of information by then. And we have some other businesses, I talked about the HRO business, our SBS business, I mean, there's other business that are frankly outperforming outside of kind of the economic factors and the mid-market business that are outperforming. So it's really not appropriate yet to jump to any conclusions, but I think your general thesis is exactly correct.\nJames Faucette: That's great. Thank you very much, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I\u2019m pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, thanks for all of you for joining us today. I hate to end on a down note here, but I think it's important for us to acknowledge, what's happening in Ukraine and express our sympathies for the folks that are in the midst of that conflict. We obviously like everyone else would like to see the violence end. We have very small exposure from a revenue and business standpoint in Russia and Ukraine, but we do have quite a number of associates and a decent sized business in Eastern Europe. And so we would love to see this violence end and certainly not to spread, we've been doing our part along with some of our colleagues and other companies in the humanitarian efforts to provide relief to the people in Ukraine. But what's really been most gratifying to me is not just what been able to do through our foundation and through ADP, but what our associates have done globally kind of reaching into their own pocketbooks to help their fellow global citizens. We increased our match, our matching contribution amounts for associates who wanted to provide to various relief agencies. And we had the largest \u2013 I think reaction we've ever had to any global crisis. And it's obvious why, because when you see the pictures of what's going on and it's truly horrifying. And I mean, for me personally, to see people leaving everything behind and children and families having to flee is personally very painful. So our hearts go out to those folks and we pray that all of the leaders involved can come to some sort of resolution and end of violence. But with that, I will thank you once again for participating with us today. And we look forward to giving you all the information you're looking for fiscal year 2023 on the next earnings call. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Maria Black",
            "content": "Thank you, Carlos. It's great to be joining everyone for the call. Also some updates on a few key initiatives we have underway. One key product initiative is the rollout of our new unified user experience. And we made some great progress on this front. Earlier this year, we moved the RUN, iHCM and Next-Gen HCM client bases over to the new UX. Feedback has been strong with clients, especially upbeat about how easy we've made key HCM workflows. In January, we shared, we started the pilot of the new UX to Workforce Now and since then, we've expanded from a handful of clients to over 1,000, early feedback has also been overwhelmingly positive. In this quarter, we began the rollout of the new UX to the ADP Mobile app. The ADP Mobile app is an incredibly important part of the ADP suite with over 10 million active users. It is one of the top five most downloaded business apps in the Apple App Store and is available in over 20 languages. And we're excited to take our 4.7 star average user experience and make it even more insightful, intuitive, and proactive for our users. As we complete the new UX rollout over the coming months. Moving on, data continues to be one of our key differentiators in this quarter, we expanded our data offerings even further, as we launched pilot clients on our new global insight dashboard powered by DataCloud. This dashboard provides our GlobalView and Celergo clients with advanced analytics for their employee populations around the globe, leveraging the same award-winning analytics platform we have scaled across our U.S. mid and upmarket client bases. Last quarter, we mentioned you would hear a bit more about our marketing efforts here at ADP. At our Investor Day in November, I spoke about how for decades, ADP has reached prospects through our powerful direct sales force and how in more recent years, we have enhanced this direct channel with modern selling tools, a growing partner network, and with increased digital advertising. This quarter, we continued to advance our great momentum and expanded our overall brand investment with additional initiatives, including our first major athletic sponsorships, a group of eight impressive professional golfers featured across the LPGA, the PGA and the European Tour who together constitute team ADP. The ADP brand is a powerful asset and has come to be associated with professionalism, insightful and trustworthy data. And the premier technology and service we pride ourselves on, and we believe there's opportunity to continue investing in our brand while also pushing the frontier in digital marketing efforts to support our world-class sales force. And as a final call out, this quarter, we were pleased to host one of our marquee client events, ADP Meeting of the Minds in California, which was back in-person for the first time since 2019. This was our 37th Meeting of the Minds conference. And we took the opportunity to engage deeply with our enterprise clients on the changing world of work. What I love most about this event is as much as we enjoy sharing our perspective with our clients and showing them our latest HCM innovations, we also make the most of this opportunity by listening to and learning from them and having the event back in-person really makes a big difference. The third quarter was a terrific quarter overall, which you can see in our results and in the progress we made on key initiatives, we were recently named one of Fortune\u2019s Most Admired Companies for the 16th year in a row. And we are proud of this honor because it highlights our culture of continuous improvement, our consistency and our focus on being a true partner to our clients. A big thank you to our associates who make this all happen. Now over to Don. With respect to the new user experience. So I mentioned a bit about it during my prepared remarks, very excited, obviously about the impact of the user experience across the entire portfolio. In terms of what it\u2019s going to do with respect to attach, I think you mentioned wisely and other attach. It\u2019s hard to tease out specifically the impact of the new user experience at this point in the quarter or even for the year as it relates to any material impacts to bookings or to attach. However, we definitely believe in what we\u2019ve developed and the impact that\u2019s going to make. So just to give a tiny bit more color. The new user experience is really based on a research driven design. That research driven design included our clients, as well as our prospects to create a user experience that\u2019s very action-oriented and it\u2019s navigation. What that means specifically is the ability to move through the process payroll, if you will or to your question, the ability to buy and attach in a very action-oriented navigation, which means you don\u2019t really need to know what\u2019s next in order to move through it. It also leverages artificial intelligence as well as machine learning to create a very personalized experience for the buyer or the user, if you will. So that it remembers how the specific individual likes to navigate through the system and serves it up that way in following subsequent sequences of usage. So the other part that we\u2019re very excited I mentioned rolling out the new user experience across the ADP mobile app. The mobile experience, one of the things that will really become a competitive advantage for us is the fact that the mobile experience will be not just for the end user such as that person that would actually purchase wisely, but also for the practitioner. And so a fully web-enabled user experience using the new user interface will certainly lend itself to a better competitive advantage for us in the future. And so as you can tell by my commentary very excited what this is going to do for us both as it relates to our sellers being able to demo and gain volume there, as well as our buyers and clients being able to engage in something a lot more user friendly, so that we can attach more business. Fair enough. We did see strength in the third quarter. As you mentioned, we saw strength that was in line with the higher end of our full year guidance in the third quarter specifically. So an accelerated result. We expected that and we delivered that. We did see strength in our down market businesses. So specifically the RUN platform sales as well as retirement services. We also saw strength in our international business. And then last but not least, I think Carlos mentioned during his prepared remarks, the strength that we saw in PEO booking with the entire HRO portfolio, which is what\u2019s reported in employer services did have specific strengths. So again, that\u2019s the down market, RUN, retirement, international and the employer services, HRO that\u2019s where we saw the strength in terms of how we feel stepping into the fourth quarter. In terms of end quarter, the strength that we saw was actually delivered toward the end of the quarter, if you will, in March. And that really gave us the confidence to narrow our guidance heading into the fourth quarter and feel optimistic as we step into the fourth quarter with respect to the overall macroenvironment. And so you mentioned the Omicron that we noded to last quarter. We didn\u2019t see that materialize. And as we sit here today, the economic tailwinds that we see in the market, the challenges that businesses are facing with the increased complexity of new legislation and the tight labor market. There are a lot of things that are out that are giving us the confidence that we will continue to execute in the fourth quarter. And as such, we felt it right to narrow the guidance range to the 13% to 16% for the full year outlook. Yes, happy to add there. The investments that we're making into the overall sales ecosystem continue to be very balanced. So it's really all about the seller enablement. So as mentioned many times, we have this world-class sales force that's out there directly distributing our products and we enable them with an entire ecosystem of modern seller tools. That's definitely where we spent the last couple of years investing, especially as clients continue to pivot between wanting in-person and virtual. So seeing great productivity there, also seeing investments in brand and marketing and advertising. That's a big piece of the balanced approach that we take. And again, I don't see huge shifts in terms of the balanced approach that we're taking, but it is really an area that we continue to invest. I should mention to in that laundry list, digital advertising. So that's an area that we continue to see significant performance year-on-year in our down market and our mid-market in terms of the execution there. So all of these things are really about continuing the approach that we've had to enable the strong sales execution that we've seen this year and going forward. So happy to be the one to start here in terms of the strength in bookings. So specifically to RUN, Mark, I think in terms of the commentary around the competitors in Rochester and others, what I would say there is our continued focus on competitive takeaways has not waned. In terms of the strength of actual RUN sales and bookings performance, it's partially anchored in the amount of new business formations that we've continued to see. And so, there is definitely strength there, but certainly not for a lack of interest in the competitive side of the house. To touch on retirement services for a minute as well since you asked about that, I would say there's definitely tailwinds there in terms of attach specific to our RUN portfolio. And so as you're aware, significant legislative changes that have happened in the retirement environment state by state, and that's yielded a tailwind for us in terms of the offer that we have and certainly that makes an impact in terms of our ability to sell new logos as well as competitive takeaways because the combination of RUN and retirement and that in this type of an environment is an incredibly compelling to compete out there in the market. So I don't know, Carlos, if you have anything else to add to that. Yes. So Carlos alluded to the competitive intensity. I think you called it trench warfare and that's certainly the case. I think in terms of being back to pre-pandemic levels, with respect to pricing and promos, we're definitely seeing the competitive intensity that would be reflective of prior years, both as it relates to the trench warfare as well as the pricing element of it. So I think it's fair to assume that it's still very competitive. I think that's part of the reason that as we think about our price increases whether it's on the new business side or on the existing client base, we're being incredibly thoughtful market-by-market, call it country-by-country, segment-by-segment, product-by-product to ensure that we continue to remain thoughtful in terms of the overall price value equation that does keep us remaining in a competitive pricing environment. So I would say that the intensity has not waned. It continues and very formidable competitors out there, and we're confident that we continue to win in the market and that we continue to take a balanced approach on the price value equation."

            "content": "Thank you, Danny, and thank you everyone for joining our call. We delivered exceptionally strong third quarter results, including revenue that accelerated to 10% growth on a reported basis and 11% growth on an organic constant currency basis, coupled with solid adjusted EBIT margin expansion. The strong outcome on both revenue and margin drove 17% growth in adjusted diluted EPS, well ahead of our expectations. Our clients have had new shortage of challenges in navigating the last 12 months, but through it all not only have they persevere but they have invested in their workforce to better support their employees and continue to grow their businesses. We're proud to support them in these efforts through our leading HCM technology and unrivaled expertise. This quarter, I'll provide high-level commentary on key business drivers, and then Maria will take us through some product and other updates. And as usual, Don will discuss the financials and our updated outlook. Let me start with Employer Services new business bookings. We are very pleased to have delivered another strong quarter of double-digit growth. This was a record level for the third quarter. And as we had hoped when we updated you last quarter, the Omicron variant was not a meaningful factor in our bookings performance, as third quarter growth accelerated from our first half levels towards the high end of our guidance range this quarter. Our clients continue to find tremendous value across our suite of offerings with our PEO and HR outsourcing, international and downmarket businesses, again, leading the way. We're pleased to narrow our ES bookings guidance higher, and we look forward to delivering this double-digit growth for the full year, which should position us well for fiscal 2023. Our employer services retention was also very strong this quarter. As you know, our third quarter is especially important for retention since we typically experience elevated switching with the start of the new calendar year. Accordingly, we were very pleased that rather than decreasing the quarter towards pre-pandemic levels like we anticipated, our retention actually increased further into record territory driven by incredible performance from our mid-market and international businesses, among others. As we've discussed for several quarters, the strong employee and client growth we've experienced have increased the demands on our implementation and service organization. We added to our headcount to keep up with this demand ahead of our busy year-end period. And as a result, we were able to maintain strong overall client satisfaction scores despite ongoing pressure from this elevated demand. With retention having outperformed our expectations so far this year, we believe we are now on pace to hold on to most of last year's retention gains and expect to remain at 92% retention for the year, down very slightly versus last year's record retention level. Moving on to Employer Services pace for control, our clients continue to steadily hire as workers enter or reenter the labor force and our pays per control growth of 7% for the quarter came in better than expected. Clearly, there are a number of factors at play when considering employment growth trends, but strong overall economic activity continues to keep demand for labor high, and we've been pleased to see labor force participation gradually recover over the course of the year. And one last highlight before I turn it over to Maria. Our PEO had another strong quarter with 16% average worksite employee growth and 14% revenue growth. As we've seen all year, growth in our PEO bookings was exceptionally strong as small and midsized businesses increasingly find value in turning over a meaningful portion of their HR function to ADP. And that strong bookings performance, coupled with robust employment growth within the PEO base has driven this very healthy double-digit revenue growth. And now let me turn it over to Maria. Sure. I\u2019ll take the first part and I\u2019ll let Maria takes the second part. On the HRO business within ES, which as you know, is kind of our full outsourcing solutions or without the co-employment, the growth there has been quite robust on bookings, which obviously then is driving really robust growth in revenues. The interesting thing about that business, I mean, you have to \u2013 you almost have to call out. It\u2019s nice to be able to do it publicly, just unbelievable execution because in our business, when you get that kind of growth, that quickly, it\u2019s very, very hard to manage. But somehow they\u2019ve managed to stay ahead into terms of headcount hiring for both implementation and service. And the business is just really performing incredibly well. Retention rates are holding up. Not just holding up, I think they are up versus the prior year, which was already a strong year. And I would say contributing to the overall improvement in retention and stickiness. So I would say that that is probably \u2013 I would get in trouble for saying this, because then I offend all the other businesses, but that\u2019s got to be one of the star performers. Now the PEO obviously isn\u2019t doing incredibly well. Also and you can see that as a separate segment, it\u2019s a little harder to see the HRO business. It\u2019s also getting big. I think if I\u2019m not mistaken, it\u2019s \u2013 probably never publicly disclosed it, but it\u2019s getting close to $1 billion in revenue. So that\u2019s a pretty solid business with again, without \u2013 I\u2019m probably not right to give you too much detail, but revenue growth is strong double digits, very strong double digits with a two in front of it, let\u2019s say. And bookings growth is incredibly robust as well, retention is strong. Just really performing very well. Listen, I\u2019m glad for the question. And I\u2019m also glad for the answer, right? Because mean reversion is my favorite term in business because when you get into large businesses and large economies, it\u2019s a powerful force in the universe. And that\u2019s exactly what it is. If you remember, this happened with some of the data that was reported by the Fed and by us in terms of employment. That in the initial stages of the pandemic, the jobs that went away the most quickly in terms of quantity were kind of lower wage jobs that in general don\u2019t have high benefits participation rates. Even though our PEO is generally white collar to gray collar, we experienced the same thing there in the PEO. So ironically at that time, it looked like our benefits per employee \u2013 worksite employee were rising, but it was really because of the averages and because of the mix shift. And now we have this mean reversion where even though the white collar jobs are growing and wages are growing, like everything is going exactly as you would want and expect in the PEO. You have this unusual thing because of the pandemic with a lot more jobs coming back that are people who don\u2019t have benefits. So it makes the benefits revenue grow slower than the worksite employee number. But it has nothing to do with any kind of policy change or change in kind of our philosophy or it\u2019s really just a re-normal or a normalization back in my opinion to where we were before. We\u2019re trying to assess kind of how long that takes and it\u2019s probably another quarter or two. There\u2019s a second factor that I think that\u2019s contributing to this, which is that state unemployment rates are coming in a little bit lower than we had expected because some states because of the strong employment market, even though they initially raised unemployment rates, because they thought that were going to have big problems in terms of people filing for unemployment. Obviously now what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s going in the other direction. And a few large states have actually lowered unemployment rates. That\u2019s not a \u2013 it\u2019s a factor. It\u2019s not a huge factor. I think that the mix shift issue is mathematically and this mean reversion is 95% of the explanation. By the way, we don\u2019t necessarily mind it one way or the other, because as you know, we treat benefits revenue as a pass-through. So there\u2019s really no profit and no margin. So it\u2019s really not relevant for us in terms of how we manage the business. Other than we have to explain it to obviously our sales community. Yes. I think that first of all, no specifics for 2023, we\u2019re going to wait until the next earnings call we have before we give more color on 2023. But as I said earlier, we\u2019re very comfortable with the fundamentals and we think we\u2019re in a good spot. We\u2019ve overcome some of the challenges that we referenced last quarter in terms of making sure we\u2019re appropriately staffed for the bigger business that we now have. We did that well going into the busiest quarter of the year. So that\u2019s all in good shape. Certainly, you guys are probably better at the numbers than me on what\u2019s the potential impact from flow balances, et cetera. Certainly, it\u2019s pretty clear that we will have higher client fund interest next year. However, how much, we\u2019re not quite sure yet, even though we\u2019re seeing rates go up, certainly there\u2019s lots of volatility in the rates. There\u2019s certainly lots of things going on. But I\u2019ll come back to the way I ended my prepared remarks and that was that we very much will be mindful of what we share with everybody at the Investor Day in November. And we will make sure that we have those targets in mind, as we prepare when we get ready to release more information on 2023. Sure. As you know, obviously our commentary is generally focused on the labor markets. Like this morning, I was hearing reports about what\u2019s happening with consumer spending, which is quite robust that obviously ends up having an impact on the labor markets, because people who are in the service sector or people who are serving consumers end up hiring people in order to fulfil that demand. But generally speaking, our comments are really around the labor markets. And as you can see from our pays per control growth, some of which is related to the previous question about comparisons, right? Like the comparisons are easier and they will get harder next year in terms of percentages. But the percentages don\u2019t matter as much as the absolute numbers, right? And the absolute numbers are strong, I think are robust. And I think as we alluded to the labor market is almost fully recovered. We obviously keep an eye also on things like GDP, GDP growth. I mean, absolute GDP dollars have already surpassed pre-pandemic levels. And they\u2019re kind of in line to get back to trend growth or exceed trend growth on a real basis, right? Because you have to factor in obviously the fact that we have some higher inflation now. I mean, our perspective generally is that the economy is very strong, like based on the things that we\u2019re looking at in our business. But we obviously live in the real world that we have to think about the next quarter or two, but also about 12 months from now and 24 months from now. And Finance 101 would tell you that increase in interest rates that are expected from the Fed and that have already been priced in, which are helping our client fund interest on the two year, five year, seven year and 10 years, I think will all slow at some point the economy, which is the intention, I think of the federal reserve to get inflation under control. Having said all that, you have to make your own decisions on whether or not that will be navigated appropriately to a \u201csoft landing\u201d. But we had 10 years from 2011 through or call it 2010 through 2020 before, right before the pandemic of what I would call relatively, historically speaking reasonable growth in GDP call it 2%, 2.5% GDP growth, gradually recovering employment. So, if we go from 3% or 5% GDP growth, the 2.5% or 2%, we like that. And I think we\u2019ve delivered some pretty outstanding results for all stakeholders during that kind of period of time. So we would not like a recession, just like no one else would like a recession. But I think if you believe that the best of is behind us that doesn\u2019t necessarily need that things are not going to be good going forward. Because we \u2013 all the indicators we\u2019re seeing right now are really strong underlying labor markets. And we also have in the U.S. an administration that will be in the seat for another call it three years, despite what happens in the midterms that is, generally more favorable towards employment regulation and \u2013 and that, I think, is a favorable tailwind for our business as well in terms of just on a macro \u2013 on a very macro level. So I think we like the environment. If the best scenario for us, frankly, which would be a homerun is that growth gradually slows not to the point where there's a recession, but where interest rates stay at the rates that they're at, particularly like kind of the three to five and the seven years, and that really is a pretty large tailwind for us from a bottom line standpoint. And the only other thing that I would add that we may not always directly linked to inflation as I am beating the dead horse here, but the client funds interest, obviously, inflation is what's driving these higher interest rates. It also happens to also drive higher balances. A lot of our balances are driven by our tax business, but wages, some of those taxes capped, but for example federal withholding taxes are not necessarily capped. So the more people get paid, the more taxes we collect and have to remit to various agencies and wages are a portion of our float balances. And clearly, there is an impact from there. Overall wage inflation, forget about our own inflation that Don is referring to, but the inflation in our client base in terms of their own \u2013 the wages of their employees is really driving \u2013 is helping our balance growth for sure. But more importantly, it's obviously driving a belief that interest rates need to rise rather rapidly, which is now being already factored in into \u2013 even though the Fed controls obviously fed funds rate you can all see what's happening with the one year, two year, three year, five year and what the expectation is for and that's all related obviously directly to inflationary expectations. I think the safest thing for us to say right now because, as Don said, we really haven't finalized that yet as we have not finalized our 2023 operating plan. So I think Don was giving you kind of directional color, which is 100% accurate. We've been doing a lot of work, and Maria and the team have been doing a lot of work on what's the appropriate pricing policy, if you will. Don mentioned the fact that on new business, it's relatively easy because that's something that we control timing-wise, whereas price changes to the book of business, we have a cycle that we go through, and we decided not to do anything unnatural or out of cycle. So that that decision is still kind of in front of us. But I think Don used the word competitive, we do not live in a vacuum. And so, we are going to do what's appropriate based on what's happening with inflation, but also with what's happening with competitors. So we're going to be watching very carefully what everyone is doing from the \u2013 obviously from the sidelines since we obviously don't have any direct insight into what our competitors are doing. But you get competitive signaling and you get hearsay here and there. So we're looking at all those things, but it's safe \u2013 I guess the best way to describe it is whatever our price increase had been historically and it was probably consistent for almost 10 years in terms of kind of what we were telling you in terms of what it represented in as a percent of revenue. It's safe to say that that's going to be higher. And you kind of have to draw your own conclusions if inflation was 2% and now it's 4% to 5%, you could infer because our costs not just our wage cost, which Don alluded to, we've already had to kind of build in higher costs for our own associates. We have other costs. We have other services and other things that are being provided to us that are like every other company and we got to cover those costs. I think our philosophy is we would like to be in line with what's happening in the market. And I think it's also safe to say that our philosophy is that we run an HCM technology services company. And this is a really nice side benefit that for however long we've been in this business, we have this float income, and it goes up and down based on interest rates and the economy and so forth. And I think compared to ten years ago, it's a much smaller portion of our bottom line. And so, that is both good and bad, right. I would have enjoyed my life and my tenure a lot more had interest rates not been as low as they were for as long as they were. But having said all that, it puts us in a much better position where it's much more clear now that ADP's core earnings are not driven by fluctuations in interest rates. And the reason we ladder our portfolio is primarily because as Don said about safety and security and liquidity, but it's also because philosophically we're not trying to gain the market, we're not trying to time the market, we are running an HCM technology services business, and that's our focus. No, I mean, we try to stay away from obviously any kind of \u2013 making comments about specific competitors, but I would say that specifically in SBS, we do watch this kind of balance of trade very carefully. And I think \u2013 I talk about it every quarter in terms of it's important to me, like one of the most important things for us in terms of long-term sustainability, and durability of our business is market share is really being able to grow units. We also love share of wallet and we love to sell additional business, et cetera, but that's important to us. And at least the figures that we're seeing in terms of our large national competitors, our balance of trade remains positive and improved in the third quarter versus the second quarter. So that to me tells me that I think we're still I think in a good place competitively and that we're doing all the right things, but having said that it's a very competitive market. There's no question about that. And everyone, I think has including some of our national competitors that have good products and good go-to-market strategies. And we are in the trenches every day competing in trench warfare with some of those competitors, we feel pretty good based on the data that we keep track of that we are doing well in terms of balance of trade and also in terms of market share. And I think the other last one you asked about was retirement services. That business, as you probably know has some significant tailwinds because of regulatory changes that are going to get, they're going to become potentially GaelForce wins, in terms of with a new, I think it's called SECURE 2.0 or because I think the first one was the SECURE Act looks like it's going to make its way through Congress with bipartisan support and the first wave and the first version of that has already created some strong demand. In addition to what was already happening at the state level, where several states were requiring small businesses to mandatorily required to provide a retirement plan. So all those things are tailwinds for that business and that would be one of those businesses that I would describe as doing incredibly well, but trying to keep its head above water to meet demand. It's a good problem to have, trust me like I've been around long enough to know these are \u2013 this is a good problem to have. But it's still a problem. And so we're busy adding resources and trying to be appropriately staffed in our RF business, because it's definitely a growth engine. I would say just general range. So you have some sense it's smaller than the HRO business, for example. So you shouldn't assume that we have $1 billion business, so you don't start getting too many images of grandeur. But it's a big business, call it maybe somewhere around half-ish of that business. I don't know, Danny, before I get into trouble, hundreds of millions of dollars. But growing, I think also at one of the faster rates, I think in terms of our businesses here and both for bookings and for revenue. Well, first of all, philosophically, we don't hide anything. So as you know, there's a nice little schedule that we include that allows everyone to do the math. And so next quarter, I'm sure you're going to do the math. And you'll ask us how come you are or aren't allowing X percent to flow through because the math is actually fairly straightforward. We give you the balances that are maturing in that year, because since we ladder the only relevant issue is really what's maturing as well as new money invested in that year, which is what benefits from the higher rates since we hold to maturity. And you'll know we'll give you a forecast of what our balance growth is going to be. And we'll also give you a forecast of what yields are going to be in the next year. So you'll have all that math and it'll be very easy to do. And then what you'll have to do is quiz us on what the other side of the ledger in terms of what are the other factors in terms of that led to the final reported or in that case guided net income figures or EBIT figures. And I think one of the things that's changed from Investor Day is that there's no question that, interest rates are way up and client funds interests \u2013 our forecast for client funds interest would be much higher because you can do the math, just like we can, the other \u2013 the variable that we want to take another quarter to make sure that we think through and that we finalize our plans before we communicate is that inflation is also way up in multiple ways, including on wages as Don alluded to, right. So when we had Investor Day, we had not yet taken this action of an off-cycle merit increase or wage increase, we had not yet which we are now fully accrued for some of our incentive bonuses, which are driven primarily by performance, but come in handy when you are competing for talent and trying to hold on to talent. And so those are all things that we have to kind of weigh now. And then the last factor being, I think Don talked about price increases, where does that finally land will also have an impact. So, there's a few more moving parts then I think is typical for us. And I think it's important for us to make sure we add it all up and rack it all up. But one thing I can guarantee you is you will have transparency. I mean, I think probably the biggest picture, the answer is no, there's no specific verticals or whatnot. We're too big and too diversified to really \u2013 it's not geographic or verticals or all that. It's basically very strong bookings with very good retention and also growth of the client base. This pays per control that we talk about in Employer Services, you have the same phenomenon in the PEO where the clients themselves are recovering, right and hiring at a faster rate than they would have been because they had either shrunk or hadn't hired during the pandemic. And so that is a tailwind also for the PEO, but the biggest factors are sales minus losses. And then what's happening with the base, which is obviously strong. I think the best way to describe it, that by the way, was all accurate like we're really happy with international, but also in particular, the mid-market, I think we kind of underestimated as usual, there are multiple moving parts. So you had the pandemic at work. And so we were looking at kind of a historical trends and thoughts, there would be some normalization within the mid-market, but we also had forgotten that right before the pandemic, not right before but 12 to 18 months before the pandemic, we completed our migrations onto one single platform, which is our modern Workforce Now platform, huge process improvement initiatives that were led by John Ayala and the team there that really improved the underlying strength of that business, right. So then you get into the pandemic and you get that noise. Now you come out of the pandemic and there's no scientific way to pull all that apart, but it does feel like our mid-market business has a new floor, if you will, or a nut floor is not the right way to describe it, but a new level of retention that's higher than it was before, that's at least right now, the way it looks in our hope going forward, so that's really good news. The other item on the out of business that you're mentioning, which is really more of a down market question, we again our big subscribers to the school of common sense, and it's playing out kind of the way we expected, because if you look at the reported level of bankruptcies from government figures, they're pretty flat, but that really is not the way the small business market works that, everyone declares bankruptcy, like some people get into business and they stop their business and they never declare bankruptcy. So that is a good proxy and it's one indication, but it's not the only one. And so we have seen some normalization in that down market business because of what we call non-controllable losses, right, which would include out of business bankruptcies, all of the above. It's a big enough factor in that segment that it's impossible to believe that it wouldn't normalize, which is why we planned the way we did. The good news is that it hasn't normalized as fast as we thought. And the other part of our business, the controllable losses have performed better than we expected. And so net-net, we are in better shape than we thought, but just because you have the second best retention you've ever had, doesn't mean that it isn't down from the previous year. And so I just wanted to be crystal clear on that because others may have a different perspective on which would defy. I think finance one-one-one theories and so forth because the number of \u2013 the percentage of losses related to the economy and so forth are just significant in the down market. And so when you have this unbelievable tailwind, when you think about the amount of stimulus that was put in with PPP loans and so forth and stimulus checks, remember some of these small businesses are just like consumers, they're one person companies, or five person companies. And when they get a stimulus check, that's like a stimulus check going to their company, that stuff is all coming out of the system and interest rates are going up. It will normalize unfortunately, but you see the outcome net-net for us, which is still incredibly gratifying and way above what we would've expected. I think that is a fair assessment that you should stand by for further details next quarter for next calendar \u2013 next fiscal year, because I think we gave you enough color. What you just described is exactly what we expect to happen for the fourth quarter and you see the outcome in terms of our overall guidance for retention. But I think what's more important for you guys is I hope is not just next quarter, but the next year. And I think we'll have another several months of information by then. And we have some other businesses, I talked about the HRO business, our SBS business, I mean, there's other business that are frankly outperforming outside of kind of the economic factors and the mid-market business that are outperforming. So it's really not appropriate yet to jump to any conclusions, but I think your general thesis is exactly correct. Well, thanks for all of you for joining us today. I hate to end on a down note here, but I think it's important for us to acknowledge, what's happening in Ukraine and express our sympathies for the folks that are in the midst of that conflict. We obviously like everyone else would like to see the violence end. We have very small exposure from a revenue and business standpoint in Russia and Ukraine, but we do have quite a number of associates and a decent sized business in Eastern Europe. And so we would love to see this violence end and certainly not to spread, we've been doing our part along with some of our colleagues and other companies in the humanitarian efforts to provide relief to the people in Ukraine. But what's really been most gratifying to me is not just what been able to do through our foundation and through ADP, but what our associates have done globally kind of reaching into their own pocketbooks to help their fellow global citizens. We increased our match, our matching contribution amounts for associates who wanted to provide to various relief agencies. And we had the largest \u2013 I think reaction we've ever had to any global crisis. And it's obvious why, because when you see the pictures of what's going on and it's truly horrifying. And I mean, for me personally, to see people leaving everything behind and children and families having to flee is personally very painful. So our hearts go out to those folks and we pray that all of the leaders involved can come to some sort of resolution and end of violence. But with that, I will thank you once again for participating with us today. And we look forward to giving you all the information you're looking for fiscal year 2023 on the next earnings call. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Don McGuire",
            "content": "Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. For our third quarter, we delivered 10% revenue growth on a reported basis and 11% on an organic constant currency basis. This revenue growth in turn supported adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points, which was much better than the decline we expected. We achieved that margin expansion despite incremental investments in headcount and compensation we discussed last quarter. Through the combination of this strong adjusted EBIT growth, a slightly lower tax rate and a lower share count, we were able to deliver a 17% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Looking more closely at the segment results, our Employer Services revenue increased 8% on a reported basis and 9% on an organic currency basis. ES revenue has been supported all year long by strong retention and pays per control trends. And our double-digit bookings performance has been contributing nicely as well. In Q3, we also started to get a more meaningful contribution from client funds interest through the combination of our 15% client funds balance growth and an average yield that was nearly flat with the prior year. This year-over-year increase in client funds interest contributed about 0.5% to our revenue growth, which is a very nice outcome compared to the last several quarters. ES margin increased 120 basis points, well ahead of our expectations for the quarter and supported primarily by revenue growth. Moving on to the PEO segment. PEO revenue remains very strong and grew 14% in the quarter. Average worksite employee growth is the primary driver to PEO revenue and remained at a very robust 16%, reaching 688,000 average worksite employees for the quarter. We continue to benefit from the strong bookings growth we\u2019ve seen all year long, as well as healthy retention and pays per control growth within the PEO client base. PEO revenue growth is a bit lower than worksite employee growth this quarter, which is fairly atypical, impacting revenue for worksite employee was a mix shift towards WSEs with a slightly lower average wage and lower benefits participation, representing continued normalization back towards a pre-pandemic mix. That said, it\u2019s good to see a recovery in all parts of the workforce in our PEO. PEO margin was flat in the quarter and included higher selling expenses driven by our strong sales momentum. Moving on to our updated outlook for the year. For ES revenues, we are raising our guidance and now expect growth of about 7% up from our previous guidance of about 6%. There are a few drivers behind that increase. We are narrowing our ES bookings guidance higher to a range of 13% to 16% up from 12% to 16% prior. So far this year, we have realized and delivered solid double digit growth. Clearly, there was geopolitical uncertainty in Europe, as well as more general macro uncertainty. But notwithstanding those uncertainties, our outlook contemplates a strong Q4 with growth in the teens and we look forward to delivering a strong finish to the year. We are raising our employer services retention guidance, and now expected to be down only 20 basis points for the year versus our prior expectation of down 40 basis points. Our retention has held up extremely well so far this year, but at a prudence, we are assuming a modest decline in Q4 for the same reasons we\u2019ve outlined all year long. For U.S. pays per control, we\u2019re once again, raising our outlook and now expect 6% to 7% growth versus our prior expectation of 5% to 6% growth driven by the ongoing recovery in the labor force participation combined with steady demand for labor from our clients. We are also raising our client funds interest outlook slightly to a range of $450 million to $455 million up from our prior expectation of $440 million to $450 million. There\u2019s no change to our 18% to 20% balance growth outlook with just a few months remaining in fiscal 2022, the benefit from higher new purchase rates for the recent yield curve shifts is modest. And therefore, we still expect yield to round to 1.4% for the year. Moving on to ES margin. We are raising our outlook to now expect margins to be up 100 to 125 basis points versus up 75 to 100 basis points prior. This increase is mainly driven by the stronger revenue outlook and margin performance in Q3 versus our expectations. Moving on to the PEO. We are narrowing our average worksite employee growth to 14% to 15% versus 13% to 15% prior driven by continued momentum in new business bookings. We are likewise narrowing total PEO revenue to 14% to 15% growth up from 13% to 15% growth prior. And we are raising PEO revenues, excluding zero margin pass-throughs to 15% to 17% growth from 14% to 16% growth prior. For PEO margin, we are raising our guidance to now expect margins to be up 25 to 50 basis points rather than flat to down 50 basis points for the year. That\u2019s driven by an improvement in pass-through expenses, including more favorability from workers compensation compared to our prior outlook. Putting it together for our consolidated outlook, we now expect revenue to grow 9% to 10% up from 8% to 9% prior. For adjusted EBIT margin, we now expect an increase of 75 to 100 basis points, up from 50 to 75 basis points prior. We are making no change to our tax rate assumption. And we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 15% to 17% up from 12% to 14% prior. Before we move on to Q&A, I wanted to quickly touch on fiscal 2023. We\u2019re still going through our planning process. And so we won\u2019t be providing any specifics this time. Clearly, there are going to be some unique puts and takes for fiscal 2023, but overall, we feel very good about the momentum in the business and we will remain focused on our medium-term growth objectives that we laid out at our November Investors Day. We look forward to providing our outlook next quarter. Thank you. And I\u2019ll turn \u2013 now turn it back to the operator for Q&A. And just as a reminder, when we talk about bookings, I think Maria mentioned it, and I\u2019m sure all of you remember that we really talk about ES bookings. So a couple years ago that we changed our approach to disclosures because we thought that disclosures in the PEO were better in a format where we really talked about growth of worksite employees. It\u2019s very easy to kind of do the math in the PEO when you talk in those terms. But to be crystal clear, if PEO bookings were included in overall bookings, they would have been meaningfully higher for ADP. And it\u2019s a non-GAAP term, but it\u2019s safe to say that client funds interest will be up a lot. Yes. So we've done a couple of things over the last quarter, as we said, we were going to on the last call and we did an off-cycle salary increase to make sure that we kept our associates happy and whole. So that was positive. We also had some bonus programs and some sales conditions, accrued programs that were certainly anticipated and booked in the quarter. So we are \u2013 from a cost side, we were able to do those things and still deliver the improved margins. So we think that was very positive for us to do. The other side of this, of course, is price increases, and the two aspects of the price increases. Certainly, we haven't yet \u2013 although planned, we haven't yet initiated large price increases with our installed base. We will make sure that we do those things accordingly, reflecting inflation and most importantly reflecting to make sure that our clients still get great value from us in a competitive environment. And what we did do though and we signaled this in the last call as well, we have increased the pricing on some of our new offers, our new offer sales we \u2013 sales we had in the last quarter. But that's having a very minimal impact on Q3 and certainly won't have an enormous impact on the full year either. So we are making sure that we're focused on pricing both in the base and with new opportunities, new prospects and making sure that we're adjusting our wage levels to keep our employees and deliver the good service that we've delivered that is contributing to the high retention rate we have. We get this question often. And at the end of the day, we keep coming back to the same thing, and that's the safety diversification and liquidity of what we invest in. And so, it's unlikely we're going to make any major changes to the way we invest funds. I think we want to be \u2013 we want to certainly do well with our portfolio, but we also want to be prudent and so we'll continue to do that. So there's really no impeditive or imperative for us to make any changes to the way we've been managing those funds in the near, mid to long term. Yes. So as I said a few minutes ago, we're very happy with the ability to hire quite a number of service implementation people going into this \u2013 going into the third quarter because that's obviously the busiest time of our year. So we made sure that we got as many people in as we could and we did quite well. And I think the retention rates are suggesting that we've continued to do a good job on behalf of our clients because they're sticking around. So very, very positive. Going forward, I think as we \u2013 once again, you're coming back to the plan a little bit that we're still putting together. But certainly, as we continue to grow, we'll continue to make sure that we staffed accordingly. And really not too much color to add there other than we've been successful at the hiring as we said we would be and it's not going to \u2013 it's not going to change dramatically and have any different impact on our overall margin than what we anticipated. And I don't know the sales continue to go very well, doing very well. We've talked the last time about productivity and things reverting back to means. And I don't know, Maria, if you want to make a comment about sales productivity, we've had good results. One last thing on margins that I would add because I think it's something that we've been for years talking about is just a reminder that the overall ADP margin does get impacted by the mix of PEO and the growth rate of PEO compared to Employer Services. So from a GAAP standpoint, we do include zero margin pass-throughs and we believe that's the right approach and I think the SEC believes that's the right approach. But I think clearly, if you took out zero margin pass-throughs from the PEO, you'd have a very different margin profile of that business and hence you would have a very different margin overall for ADP. I only raised that because it is important to look at those two separately because you do have a mix shift issue that happens that doesn't necessarily tell you what the underlying strength of those businesses are. And that sometimes helps us in terms of our story, sometimes it hurts us, but it's the appropriate thing to guide you to, to look at. Because in this case, for example, the underlying margin is much higher because of the pressure that we're getting from zero margin pass-through as a result of that mix. Yes. So I'll just start with opportunities. Certainly, as always, there is no shortage of things floating around and things to assess and review, et cetera. So we continue to do that. But as Carlos has said and we've said over a long period of time, if we're ever going to do anything other than a tuck-in here and there, which we had \u2013 we did have one in Q2. But other than tuck-in here and there, we're very disciplined in making sure that we're just not adding additional products where we already have products and making sure that we can keep our portfolio as clean as possible. So we continue to look at opportunities and evaluate things and we will make the right choices when the time \u2013 should the time come. On the \u2013 just in terms of our overall philosophy, I don't think we've changed our philosophy. We continue to be committed to the share buybacks that we've committed to dividends in the 55% to 60% range, although we were a little bit higher. I think we were 61% last year, but we're committed to that 55% to 60% range. the \u2013 even though the markets are off, just back to opportunities for M& a little bit more, even though the markets are off a little bit, and I think that the valuations that are out there are still quite high, the expectations at a number of people, who are looking to do something with their current operations, their expectations really haven't adjusted to or reflected what we're seeing in the market. So it's not any easier yet, but we will watch, we will evaluate. And if we see something or things that make sense, we'll do. It's appropriate. And Mark, you asked about Workforce Now bookings. So we shared color on some of this already, but in addition to the HRO business, which is doing really well and uses Workforce Now. And then the PEO business, which also uses Workforce Now, there's just the mid-market HCM solution, we didn't call it out, but that also did very well double-digit growth. Just to clarify that, that second best comment James was with respect the down market only. Overall, it was an all-time high."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Michelle and I\u2019ll be your conference Operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call.  I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded and all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, press the pound key. Thank you. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanyal Hussain: Thank you Michelle and welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our CEO, and Don McGuire, our CFO. Also joining us for Q&A is Maria Black, President of ADP.  Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC\u2019s website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call.  During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures which we believe to be useful to investors and that excludes the impacts of certain items. A description of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today\u2019s call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. With that, let me turn it over to Carlos.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you Dany, and thank you everyone for joining our call.  We\u2019re pleased to have delivered strong second quarter results, including 9% revenue growth, 20 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion, and a 9% increase in adjusted diluted EPS, all ahead of our expectations. It remains a very dynamic and challenging business environment for our clients and prospects, but we believe the value of working with a trusted ACM partner with more than seven years of expertise is more compelling than ever, and we see evidence of this reflected in our continued sales momentum as well as our very high levels of client satisfaction and retention, which continue to drive upside to our results. As usual, let me start with some highlights from the quarter. Our employers services new business booking results were strong despite the onset of the omicron variant at the end of the quarter. We experienced a record Q2 booking level and like Q1, we were pleased to be ahead of pre-pandemic sales productivity levels. We experienced robust double-digit growth in nearly every one of our ES businesses, and as we saw earlier in the year, we experienced every stronger performance in our PEO segment, where demand is especially robust. As we outlined at our November investor day, the pandemic and the dynamic macroeconomic environment have made running HR more challenging for our clients. Today our clients navigate a tight labor market across their organizations, higher than usual worker turnover, new legislative requirements, and in many cases staffing challenges specifically within their payroll and HR departments.  The strong broad-based demand across our ES and PEO segments reflect the fact that clients of all sizes are increasingly looking for greater levels of assistance and expertise to help address their needs, in some cases seeking our intuitive yet comprehensive software offerings while in other cases seeking a more fully outsourced solution. We believe we provide extraordinary value through all business environments, and today\u2019s environment supports a continuation of a positive decades-long secular trend in global HCM. Moving onto employer services retention, we are pleased to have experienced continued strength. Although our retention in the quarter did decline very slightly versus last year\u2019s elevated level, it declined by less than we had anticipated and would have represented a record Q2 if you were to exclude last year\u2019s pandemic impacted retention levels. With overall client satisfaction once again reaching a record level this quarter, this strong retention is not surprising to us. Moreover, early January results look strong, giving us greater confidence for the rest of the year, and we are pleased to be raising our retention guidance once again. Our ES pays per control metric came in slightly better than expected at 6% growth in the quarter. We are very pleased to see the U.S. unemployment rate back below 4%, which reflects the U.S. economy\u2019s ongoing improvement and resulting strong demand for workers. Meanwhile, labor force participation is gradually recovering and as it does, we should continue to benefit from higher than usual pays per control growth. Over the first half of the fiscal year, we\u2019ve tracked ahead of our expectations and are now raising our pays per control outlook for the full year.  In the second quarter, our PEO had stellar performance once again and was well ahead of our expectations with 15% revenue growth and 16% average worksite employee growth, representing acceleration from last quarter despite a slightly harder growth comparison. Across the board strength in our PEO continues to be driven by several factors, including better than expected retention and bookings contributing to client growth, better than expected hiring within the PEO client base, further adding to worksite employee growth, and better than expected wage levels further adding to revenue growth. While some of these tailwinds will normalize over time, we remain very confident in the outlook of our PEO business over the coming years.  During our November investor day, we also outlined key aspects of our growth strategy by product and by business unit, and we are confident about sustaining healthy growth in our fast-growing businesses and optimistic about accelerating our growth in our businesses that continue to transition to our most modern offerings. One aspect of our growth strategy that we discussed is an overall greater focus on marketing, which we believe will allow us to better activate our existing scale distribution. We believe at ADP, we can deliver a lot of incremental value from tactical investments, and we look forward to sharing more in the very near future. One key product initiative we talked about during investor day that cuts across our businesses is the development of a new unified user experience, and in the second quarter we were pleased to have made further progress on this effort. As a reminder, we shared last quarter that we moved our Run client base over to the new ADP UX, and now only a quarter in, early indicators suggest that clients are in fact finding it more intuitive, resulting in fewer client service contacts.  In Europe, we have been gradually transitioning our client base over to our award-winning IHCM platform, and in Q2 we seamlessly moved those clients over to the new ADP UX. We\u2019re now very excited that just this month, we began our pilot of the new ADP user experience for Workforce Now, which when coupled with our next gen payroll engine makes for an even more differentiated offering for what is already a market-leading HCM solution in this target market. In terms of a few other highlights, I\u2019m pleased to share that we reached a new milestone by running 1 million pay slips for a single client on a single day for the first time. At the other end of the spectrum, our Roll mobile app, which serves the micro segment, continues to outperform our initial expectations. In another milestone in calendar 2021, the ADP mobile app had over 1 billion log-ins, highlighting the growing amount of direct engagement we have with employees and managers around the world. To that point, this month our return to workplace mobile solution, part of the ADP mobile app, was awarded the Business Intelligence Group\u2019s 2022 Big Innovation Award. As a final highlight, just this week we launched our bill pay feature in the Wisely app. Bill pay is free to Wisely users and fully integrated into the app, and has been a top requested feature from our user base. We believe this addition will further drive engagement and retention, and we look forward to continuing to expand the Wisely ecosystem. Overall, Q2 represented a solid outcome on both the financial front as well as with respect to key strategic initiatives. I\u2019d like to thank our associates who continue to deliver these exceptional products and outstanding service to our clients, and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Don.\nDon McGuire: Thank you Carlos, and good morning everyone.  In the second quarter, we delivered 9% revenue growth on both a reported and organic constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBIT margin was up 20 basis points, better than planned, and supported by our better than expected revenue growth, offset partially by increased PEO pass-throughs and headcount growth in our implementation and service organizations. I\u2019ll share more on this last point when I discuss our outlook. Our tax rate was up slightly in the quarter versus last year, driven by the lapping of a one-time international tax benefit we experienced last year. When including the benefit from share repurchases, we had a 9% increase in our adjusted diluted earnings per share.  Moving onto the segments, our employer services revenue increased 6% on a reported basis and 7% on an organic constant currency basis. In addition to the strong bookings, retention trends, and pays per control performance Carlos outlined, our client funds interest grew for the first time since the pandemic started as lower average yield was offset by a tremendous 28% balance growth. This growth included some benefit from the lapping of last year\u2019s deferred employer social security taxes and incremental benefit from the repayment of a portion of those employers\u2019 social security taxes, which together contributed several points of growth in addition to the already robust growth from higher client count, employment growth, and higher wages. Our ES margin increased 40 basis points, ahead of our expectations for the quarter and supported by better than expected revenue performance.  Moving on, our PEO continued to deliver exceptional performance with 15% revenue growth in the quarter. Average worksite employees accelerated to 16% year-over-year growth and reached 660,000 for the quarter. Key contributors were strong bookings and retention, as well as very healthy pays per control growth within the PEO client base. Revenues excluding zero-margin pass-throughs grew 18%, which was driven by worksite employee growth as well as higher average wages and higher SUI revenues per worksite employee. PEO margin was down 10 basis points in the quarter. Included in that figure was pressure from workers\u2019 comp and SUI expenses due primarily to worker mix and wages.  Moving on to our updated outlook for the year, for ES revenues we are narrowing our guidance and now expect growth of about 6%, the upper end of our previous guidance range of 5% to 6%. The primary drivers for our higher outlook are the stronger Q2 performance, our higher client funds interest outlook for the year, and higher pays per control growth, partially offset by an expectation from incremental FX headwind in the back half of this year on the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar.  For our client funds interest revenue, we\u2019re raising our outlook by $20 million to a range of $440 million to $450 million. Like last quarter, we\u2019re raising our balance growth assumption meaningfully to now expect growth of 18% to 20%, whereas our client funds yield expectation is unchanged despite the improvement in interest rates. This is primarily because our stronger than previously expected balance performance creates a temporary lag with greater short term investments before we purchase higher yielding fixed rate securities. For U.S. pays per control, we\u2019re raising our outlook by 1% to now expect 5% to 6% growth. We continue to expect that a gradual ongoing recovery in labor force participation will support job growth, and the first half of the year was a bit ahead of expectations.  In addition to client funds and pays per control, we are raising our retention guidance slightly and now expect it to be down 40 basis points for the year. Although we still anticipate some normalization in client switching activity, trends so far this year have been very positive, and January is looking like a continuation of that same strength. One thing we\u2019re not changing at this time is our ES booking guidance. As Carlos outlined, our Q2 performance was strong, but bookings is one place where the evolving pandemic conditions and the omicron variant has potential to create noise, as we saw at the outset of the pandemic. Although we haven\u2019t seen a material impact at this time, we still think it\u2019s prudent to maintain a wide range of outcomes in our guidance. For our ES margin, we are making no change to our outlook of up 75 to 100 basis points. Although we are raising our revenue guidance and although some of that is coming from high margin revenues, like client funds interest and pays per control, at the same time we are now more fully caught up on implementation and service headcount after running a bit behind earlier this year and late last year. This investment in implementation and service teams is critical both because the current year-end period is important to our clients and their employees, and also as we look to get ahead of the needs of our growing client base. With the continued outperformance in retention, we\u2019re now planning to grow our implementation and service teams slightly more than we had previously planned as we exit this fiscal year.  In addition to this growth in personnel, we also took one-time compensation actions across our organization in recognition of broader inflation trends in the market. The incremental expenses associated with those actions are now included in our outlook. Although this tight labor market has created its own set of challenges for most companies, we are very pleased to have been able to grow our organization as much as we did these past few months, and the wage increases we layered in give us confidence regarding our staffing levels at a busy time of year. We are also pleased to have been able to support those changes without detriment to our existing guidance ranges. Moving onto the PEO, following the strong first half trends in both client growth and worksite employee growth, we are now expecting average worksite employees to grow 13% to 15%, and we are likewise raising our guidance for PEO revenues and revenues excluding zero-margin pass-throughs by two percentage points each. Our outlook will continue to be sensitive to employment trends within our PEO client base, as well as bookings and retention performance, so although we are currently contemplating growth to be a bit lower in the back half of the year, we could continue to see upside if the current robust trends persist. For PEO margin, we are making no change to our guidance of flat to down 50 basis points for the year. Although we are raising our revenue guidance, we are at the same time expecting higher SUI and workers\u2019 comp expenses to create offsetting margin pressure. Putting it all together for our consolidated outlook, we now expect revenue to grow 8% to 9%. For adjusted EBIT margin, we continue to expect an increase of 50 to 75 basis points. As we shared earlier this year, we expect our margin improvement to be concentrated in the fourth quarter and expect our margin to be down in Q3, particularly following the recent personnel growth and wage increases. We\u2019re making no change to our tax rate assumption. With these changes, we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 12% to 14%.  Thank you, and I\u2019ll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Bryan Keane with DB. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi guys, congrats on the results.  Just wanted to ask on the impact of omicron, especially in December and January. Is there any noticeable impact in sales or retention, or anything that you\u2019d call out particularly from the rise that we\u2019ve seen from the virus and omicron?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think you heard from our prepared comments that the answer was no, but when you think about the way the quarter works, the omicron really started to pick up in, I would say, middle to last December in terms of my recollection. It\u2019s really incredible how fast things have changed with this, because now we\u2019re back on the down slope in the northeast, it appears at least, in the U.S., so it\u2019s pretty fast moving. But I would say that our answer is no, we didn\u2019t see anything in the quarter that we just reported. Obviously we\u2019re now in the next quarter and it\u2019s kind of difficult to start talking about the next quarter, given we\u2019re only, I think, three weeks into it, but you\u2019ve seen probably multiple reports--I saw one this morning in the Journal about, I think it was the IMF or someone kind of lowering global growth and so forth, and some of it is obviously a result of omicron, there\u2019s probably other factors as well.  We do believe that we\u2019re not immune from these kinds of things that ripple through the economy, including omicron, but the truth is we haven\u2019t really seen a big impact yet. But if GDP growth--I think the GDP growth for the full calendar year, most people have kind of kept it in the same range, so I\u2019m guessing that people have lowered their first quarter - talking about calendar quarters now - GDP growth forecasts slightly and probably increased, because I think it\u2019s just a matter of pushing activity forward, because it does look like in a few weeks, things will start to, quote-unquote, normalize in at least a portion of the country, and then I think shortly thereafter economic activity should be robust again, as was, I think, predicted by a bunch of economists. So anyway, that\u2019s a long way of saying not really, not yet, but we\u2019re always careful to not assume that we are somehow insulated completely from what happens in the overall economy. If people are traveling a little bit less, for example our own associate population, we proactively asked--we were already back in the process of getting people back into our offices, and we went back in the other direction for about a month or two. That just lowers economic activity - people aren\u2019t driving as much, they\u2019re not going to lunch in a local area, etc., and those things have a ripple effect through the economy, but no signs of any major decrease in demand or economic activity from our numbers yet.\nBryan Keane: Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Just as a follow-up, wanted to ask about the strength in the balance growth - I think it was up 22% last quarter, up 28% this quarter. I don\u2019t know if you guys look at how much inflation could be driving that number as well, and any other call-outs--I know you raised the guide there, but just surprised at the strength there.\nDon McGuire: Yes, we have had some growth. Certainly wages were a little bit of that, but also as we said in the prepared remarks, the big driver was the lapping from last year with the deferral, so certainly the deferrals represented a few points in the growth of those balances in the quarter, although even the deferrals were only for a few number of days towards the end of the month of December.  Certainly we look at those, but as we said, we do expect the balance growth to continue and we expect it to be firm based on the pays per control and the increase in number of people working for our clients. I think that\u2019s the biggest driver.\nCarlos Rodriguez: And just in terms of a refresher, by deferrals, I think Don said in his remarks, there\u2019s a social security tax deferral. Not everyone lives day to day like us, but it was a significant stimulus--part of the stimulus package, if you will, and those social security deferrals need to be repaid half--we just went through that, which is what helped us in terms of tailwind on balances, and the other half is next December 31. That\u2019s something maybe to pencil in which would provide some support to our balances next year as well.\nBryan Keane: Okay, thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you, good morning. Could you unpack demand trends, looking at Run, Workforce Now, and Vantage HCM in the quarter and what\u2019s embedded in your 12% to 16% ES bookings growth outlook?  As a follow-up, if you could comment on your recent announcement that you\u2019re expanding Workforce Now with international functionality, what sort of traction do you expect to see there? Thanks.\nMaria Black: Yes, good morning, this is Maria. Thanks for the question, David, happy to comment on both. With respect to the overall performance in the quarter, as was stated in the prepared remarks, we had strong double-digit growth that did really go across our scaled offerings, specifically in the down market. We saw the strength in our Run platform, we saw the strength in our retirement solutions, definitely experienced strength in the Workforce Now platform. I\u2019ll cover off on your second question as well as we get to the press release that we just issued. Additionally in the second quarter, we also saw strength in GlobalView, so very happy with our international contribution to the quarter, so that was really the strength across the double-digit growth that we saw in employer services. As it relates to the Workforce Now press release that I think we issued in the last couple days regarding the offer that now is on a global basis, the ability for our U.S.-based and Canadian-based companies to process payroll on the Workforce Now platform across multiple countries, in partnership with our Celergo offering. Very excited to have this offering, as you could imagine. Over the course of the last decade but certainly in the last couple years, the ability for mid-market customers to really be able to support international employees on their end is a growing demand, and we\u2019re pretty excited to be able to satisfy that demand with this new offer.\nDavid Togut: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks so much. Carlos, I think you talked about improvement in retention against a still challenging environment overall. Can you maybe reconcile those comments a little bit because, all things equal, I would think tougher environment, maybe you have a little bit more pressure from a client perspective. Can you unpack that a little bit?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, I think what we\u2019ve been saying for probably a few quarters now, it\u2019s really not--maybe the tougher environment isn\u2019t the right term. It\u2019s tougher comparisons, because our thesis was that we\u2019d gotten some tailwind from the pandemic--there were a lot of tailwinds in a lot of areas, but one of them was in retention. There\u2019s less clients switching, and on top of that, there was also lower bankruptcy rates in down market, where it\u2019s a significant portion of the turnover of our clients is, quote-unquote, out of business, so all the government stimulus and all the low switching, I think really elevated our retention. At the same time, our NPS scores and client satisfaction and all the feedback we\u2019re getting from clients was very, very strong, so frankly it\u2019s difficult to separate the two, so we planned for some moderation in our retention as a result of those tailwinds because those tailwinds are going to go away. I think they\u2019re economically driven, and we\u2019ve seen a little bit of that in our down market. I think we\u2019ve also kind of alluded to that, that despite our continuing strong retention, it\u2019s kind of generally playing out the way we expected, which is our down market SBS is a little--is down a little bit over the previous year, but other parts obviously are holding up well, if not improving, and the net of that is better than we expected and better than we had planned. The question is, are we going to be able to hold onto all of it? Our plan of course is to hold onto all of it, and that is why you saw in Don\u2019s comments that we\u2019re making sure we have the right levels of service, the right levels of implementation, because if we can achieve the forecast we have for retention for the year, which will be ahead of what our plan and our expectations were, that has a meaningful impact on our long term growth and value creation for the company.\nKevin McVeigh: That\u2019s very helpful. Then I don\u2019t know if this would be Carlos or Don, but could you remind us the rate sensitivity, 25 basis points, what that means? Then I guess I was surprised to see the boost in the extended investment strategy, just given I thought there was a little bit more of a lag effect on that, so maybe just--because obviously it\u2019s been so long, we\u2019ve been in front of a rate cycle, but just the dynamics of client funds relative to extended investment.\nDon McGuire: Yes, why don\u2019t I start with the second question first on the rate environment and what that means for us. Generally speaking, as you know, when the fund balances increase rapidly, we have to invest in short term items or short term instruments until we have the opportunity to invest in longer term instruments, and as a result, we don\u2019t see as much pick-up as we would like to see. But I can certainly give you some sensitivity with respect to if we had a 25 basis point improvement in the rates in our short term investments only, that would translate into about $9 million of EBIT on a 12-month basis, so not hugely significant. On the other hand, if we saw that both in the short and the intermediate term, that 25 basis points over a 12-month period would translate into about $23 million of impact before taxes, so certainly that becomes meaningful. As we look to invest those funds longer term and as rates continue to go in what we\u2019d say--I guess what we\u2019d say is a better direction, I think we have some opportunity in the future; but at this point in time, we think that we\u2019re not going to see a huge amount of improvement in the client fund interest over the balance of the second half. What we have talked about is in the forecast today.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Kevin, could you clarify the question on the extended portion, where specifically you\u2019re focused there?\nKevin McVeigh: I guess just the dynamics of the client funds interest revenue versus the extended investment strategy, what the timing difference is on those two in terms of when you\u2019d see it, because obviously you saw a little bit of benefit from extended investment in term of the outlook, not as much on the client fund side, but is there a timing element to the extended versus the client funds.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, if you\u2019re talking about balance growth, the extended strategy balance growth is actually tied more to the volatility of cash flows on a year-to-year basis, so it has to do with our forecast of what our low balance is going to be in the year versus our average balance, which is a little bit different from the client funds forecast.  Long term, yes, the extended balance would grow kind of in line with the client funds balance growth, but on a short term, year-to-year basis, there\u2019s a whole more noise. That is actually driving the difference more so than the lag effect. The lag effect that Don was referring to has more to do with the growth in the client funds balances. When the growth is particularly high, it\u2019s often hard for us to reinvest quickly given the number of opportunities there are in the market and so forth for the type of credit quality that we\u2019re seeking, but we within a couple quarters can catch up, so it\u2019s just a question of how quickly we can deploy those additional funds. I think the short answer is the net impact from our strategy, because there\u2019s also a re-classing issue in terms of how we do it, in terms of accounting and so forth, so I think the right way to look at it is really what\u2019s happening with yields, what\u2019s happening with--overall, what\u2019s happening with balance growth, and then what\u2019s the net impact of our strategy, of our client fund strategy. I think on that front, the short answer is it\u2019s looking pretty good. Just as an example, our Q1 re-investments were at about a 1% yield, so new purchases, and in Q2 they were 1.5%, so it\u2019s been--you see the same thing we\u2019ve seen. The moves in the two-years and the five-years are even more significant than the 10-years and so forth, so for us it\u2019s the--you know, when we talk long, our version of long is three, five, seven, not beyond that, just because of the way we invest our portfolio, and on that front, you could not have a better environment in terms of wage inflation, balance growth and increases in interest rates. I would say we\u2019re not ready to say anything yet about \u201923 and \u201924, but all this--there\u2019s a lot of talk about mechanics in the short term or whatnot, because I know a lot of people are focused on the short term, but we\u2019re more long term oriented and we could be in here for a multi-year tailwind finally from client funds interest in a meaningful way.\nKevin McVeigh: You\u2019re going to have a high class margin problem, Carlos.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, listen - I\u2019ve been waiting 10 years. I had hair when I started as CEO, and I remember telling the treasurer at the time, rates have to go up next year, and then next year I said rates have to go up next year, and here we are. But this time, dammit, I\u2019m right!\nKevin McVeigh: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-tsin Huang: Thanks so much guys, good morning. Really good results, better base control, looking at better retention, in-line bookings, raising balance growth, and all that good stuff. I think of all of these as positive forces for margin expansion, right, so you\u2019re keeping the margin the same, so is that just a function of the costs you discussed, or is that some conservatism as well? Just trying to better understand that.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well if the question is about conservatism, I\u2019ll let Don handle it.\nTien-tsin Huang: Thank you. Thank you Carlos.\nDon McGuire: Yes, so I think the answer is that we have got a pretty reasonable forecast in front of us, so I think we\u2019re not being terribly conservative. But I think what you should consider, though, is that we raised our revenue by $150 million from the prior--from the prior forecast, and we\u2019ve also raised our expenses by $115 million. If you start to break down those expenses, that $115 million of expense increase, you come pretty quickly to PEO pass-throughs - we had $48 million of that, so $48 million of that expense increase is really having a bit of a drag on our margins. Otherwise, I think our margins clearly would be better, but that\u2019s really what\u2019s preventing us, and that\u2019s the reason we haven\u2019t been able to do more on the margins. But I do think that all in, we\u2019ve done a really good job of baking things into our guidance and firming up the expectations we set.\nTien-tsin Huang: No, for sure. It\u2019s very good.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Just one other thing, I think we should also add to your point in terms of tone, we want to make sure we\u2019re clear here that we\u2019re not insulated from the world. There is no question that there is pressure on costs, particularly around wages, and we are a technology services company so we have costs around R&D and so forth. We also have costs around the service side of our business, and you\u2019ve heard in the prepared comments that Don mentioned that we\u2019ve taken some actions that are what I\u2019d call mid-cycle, so not the typical annual wage increases, because we felt we needed to do something to make sure that we held onto our people and that we were attracting the right kinds of people, so we are doing some things. Now, the good news on the other side of that coin, which I\u2019m assuming will come up later as a question but may as well address it now, like some other industries but not every other industry, we do have a fair amount of, and the industry has shown, demonstrated historically and, I think, there are some recent signs from competitors that pricing is more elastic than in many industries. This is not a commodity business, and there\u2019s a fair amount of room. The problem is you have to exercise that room very carefully because you want to remain competitive, and on and on and on. You\u2019ve heard that story from us for many years too, that we really want to win in the market, we want higher retention rates, so we can\u2019t just go around willy-nilly passing through price increases, but the fact is we can and we will if it\u2019s driven by market forces and cost increases that are experienced across the board. We\u2019re confident that our competitors will do the same thing, and some of them already are. \nTien-tsin Huang: You answered my follow-up on pricing. Thank you Carlos. Thank you Don. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to maybe circle back to the PEO business and the strength there, it continues to perform really well. I was curious, can you remind us, when we think about the source of new bookings for PEO, how much of it is new to ADP for the first time versus conversions of potential existing customers in the SMB side of the base that you\u2019re up-selling over to PEO? How should we think about the source of new bookings?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think it\u2019s been pretty consistent for a long time at around 50%, right?\nMaria Black: That\u2019s right.\nCarlos Rodriguez: It\u2019s about half, that we kind of mine our own. It\u2019s a combination of mining our own clients, but we also mine our own sales force. Our sales force is able to bring in obviously new clients straight onto the PEO, but we also have a very large installed base that, as you alluded to, we mine. I think it\u2019s 50/50, if I\u2019m not mistaken. It hasn\u2019t really changed that much over the years.\nSamad Samana: Great, that\u2019s helpful. Then as I think about the consolidation of the base onto one UI, there\u2019s clear user benefits to that, but how should we think about maybe--is there a tailwind to that on the gross margin side as more and more of the base is on a single UI from, I guess, a service or a maintenance standpoint in terms of spend going forward, and how should we think about that unfolding on the gross margin line?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I think that\u2019s a fair point - there\u2019s a lot of things that we do that are intended to really, quote-unquote, standardize and to be able to get leverage, and this is clearly one of those where--you know, ADP historically was a little bit more fragmented in terms of our R&D, and we\u2019ve been, starting with my predecessor, I think trying to become more unified, etc., and the user experience is one of those places where there was an obvious opportunity that I think will make us better competitively and allow us to invest our money more efficiently, and there clearly is some back end benefit to that from a margin standpoint. But I would say I\u2019d be--I don\u2019t think it would be true to say that that was the primary driver. There\u2019s got to be some residual help from a margin standpoint and from an efficiency standpoint, but this is really about winning, about having the best products and having the best face to the market in terms of our--the best skin, if you will, on each of our products. It makes a difference, as you know.  We get it, we\u2019re a technology company now, and it matters a lot the experience that our--and it\u2019s not just our clients. It used to be 20, 30 years ago, it was only the clients. Now the employees of our clients are obviously touching and interacting with our products, especially with the mobile app, and this user experience stuff matters a lot in terms of engagement.\nSamad Samana: Great, helpful. Congratulations on the solid results. \nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning, thank you. First, I want to follow up on retention. Can you dig in a little bit more about the underlying drivers, so out of business closures versus competitive switching behaviors? When you think about the 40 basis point year-over-year decline you forecasted, how much is due to a pick-up in that closure rate versus competitive losses?\nCarlos Rodriguez: Almost all of it is in the down market and related to normalization of economic factors, like closure rates. I don\u2019t know that closure rate is the right word, but that\u2019s one of the--that\u2019s in that category, what we call--we track uncontrollable losses and controllable losses. Controllable losses would be around service and product, etc.; uncontrollable is the obvious, like bankruptcies, out of business, etc.  What happened during the pandemic, it wasn\u2019t just that bankruptcies went down. All the categories of uncontrollable losses went down, and there has been some normalization of that, not all the way back to pre-pandemic, but I would say that there\u2019s really nothing that you could read into the numbers to tell you anything other than we have fantastic service, solid NPS scores, but there is some normalization in categories, specifically more down market. Everywhere else, I think our retention rates are good to improving and solid, and in many cases better than prior years.  We have less tolerance in those other businesses because they\u2019re not as economically sensitive, so we have less tolerance for the excuse that there\u2019s going to be normalization there, because we now have a taste of what\u2019s possible in retention in the mid-market and in international and in--although international has been strong all along and in the up-market, and we just want to maintain those retention levels. But it would be foolish in the down market to assume that there won\u2019t be some economic factors and normalization - that\u2019s what you see reflected in our forecast.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, makes sense. Then just on the PEO strength, so the sequential increase in worksite employees was really notable here. Can you just dig in a little bit more? I heard better units, so better retention, better bookings, but does seem like there\u2019s been a release or a tipping point here around clients converting to this model. Can you just talk about that? \nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, I think that--we\u2019re thrilled, just to be clear, but let me just give you a few, back to these comparisons in the pandemic and noise. Part of our headwind in the PEO sales, which by the way we\u2019re positive and we\u2019re good, but not as good as ES last year. I think we shared a little bit of color there that the average client size sold had come down a little bit, wages weren\u2019t growing that much, so all of those things have an impact more on the PEO than they do in ES, particularly in some of the ES units.  Those things have all turned in the other direction now, so the average size client is bigger in terms of clients sold, and that is meaningful, and then you have wage growth which flows through the PEO. It doesn\u2019t flow through ES because the billing is not as a percent of wages, whereas in the PEO it is, and so we do have a number of tailwinds that are also helping. But the most important thing, which is maybe what you\u2019re alluding to, is the average worksite employee growth, which kind of cuts through the inflation and the wage growth and all that, and that\u2019s also robust but that\u2019s getting assistance, like I just mentioned, from average size client being a little bit bigger in terms of new business bookings. Again, that\u2019s great news, but it\u2019s a little bit of a normalization because it\u2019s actually back now, so it went down from where it was pre-pandemic, and now it\u2019s back up about to where it was pre-pandemic, and hopefully, you know, you get 1% to 2% growth going forward, but right now it\u2019s more than just 1% to 2% growth. \nBryan Bergin: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi there, thanks for taking my question today. I wanted to ask you about your HCM products and the cross-sell opportunity into your base of payroll customers, sort of an update in terms of where you are there and whether you could potentially accelerate that process.\nMaria Black: Yes, so happy to comment on our HCM products and how our sellers go to market to drive the combination of new business bookings between new logos as well as add-on business, our HCM products from an attached perspective. As you can imagine, a lot of the investments that we\u2019ve spoken about for several years in existing products, a lot of the investments that we\u2019re making into our existing platforms - we just talked about the new UF and the impact that\u2019s making in our down market and will continue to make, coupled with the investments that we\u2019re making into our next gen products, are all investments that are anchored in a belief that we can continue to expand the offerings to our existing clients as well as new clients. Excited about the execution on each one of these initiatives and the impact that it will make to our bookings and the mix of bookings between new logos and HCM products attached.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Our attach rates in general are pretty good, particularly in some categories like--we said this before, like our workforce management, we used to call it time and labor, those products tend to have high attach rates, and others have high attach rates, others have low attach rates. I think part of our opportunity for whatever the years to come is to not only sell new logos, which we\u2019re now obsessed about because we want to grow market share, but share of wallet is a huge opportunity for us. The fact is, we have very low-ish penetration still in many of our categories and many of our products. \nRamsey El-Assal: Interesting, okay. Thank you for that. A follow-up for me is on M&A and balance sheet deployment here. Obviously a lot of the valuation multiples in the sector have pulled in quite a bit. I don\u2019t know if the environment has created a situation where maybe you had a shopping list, a dream shopping list that maybe now you can go after that you couldn\u2019t before. But maybe an update on whether--you know, on your capital allocation and specifically as it relates to M&A plans would be helpful.\nDon McGuire: Yes, I think that there\u2019s always things flowing across everybody\u2019s desk and evaluations being done of opportunities, etc. While it\u2019s true that the last few weeks haven\u2019t been kind to some companies, I don\u2019t we\u2019ve really changed our objectives, and our objective is to make sure that anything that we seriously consider and we pursue has to fit the portfolio, so whether it\u2019s--it just has to be either a geography extension of what we currently have or it has to be something that\u2019s filling a product niche, and so we\u2019re going to continue to work by those guidelines, if you will. If things become more affordable and something falls into those categories, certainly we\u2019ll take the opportunity to look more seriously or to look a bit harder than we might have, say, three or four months ago. I don\u2019t know, Carlos, if you want to expand on that?\nCarlos Rodriguez: No, all I was thinking was that in some cases, if people pay us, we\u2019ll buy their companies. \nRamsey El-Assal: All right, fantastic. I appreciate it. Thanks so much.\nCarlos Rodriguez: And then we can clean them up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Good morning everybody, and congratulations on the quarter. I was wondering, could you give us a couple of updates with regards to some of the products? In terms of next generation pay, to what extent has that been further rolled out? What\u2019s the update there?\nCarlos Rodriguez: I would say we had a really good, I think, first--I would call it year end, because when you get to the midmarket, which is next gen pay, as you know right now is really being sold in a portion of what we call the core part of the midmarket, so call it 50 to 150, and I think we\u2019re at--we\u2019re selling somewhere between 20%, 25% of our clients, of our new businesses coming in on the new platform, and we expect to be GA, I think it\u2019s end of calendar--\nMaria Black: This calendar year, that\u2019s right.\nCarlos Rodriguez: End of calendar year, so that\u2019s kind of what we talked about at investor day. I would say that, call it December-January sales season, because a lot of those clients, they want to start clean on January 1, so it\u2019s a fairly important point of the year in terms of judging where you are in terms of sales results and so forth, and we had a fairly good, I think, number of starts. We were happy, I would say, with the early January, late December, what I would starts results - in other words, those are clients that we sold previously, that we got started and we have up and running.  We try and avoid getting into specifics of how many clients, because then every quarter you guys are going to ask us, but I\u2019d say that that\u2019s going really well and we\u2019re on track for this GA by the end of the calendar quarter, and then we had a good start season for end of December, beginning of January.\nMark Marcon: That\u2019s great. Then it sounds like--you know, one of the early comments that you gave, Carlos, was highlighting just the breadth, talking about how Roll is doing on the low end and then also mentioning that at one client, you had a million transactions in a single day, which is obviously impressive. Can you just give us a sense for in terms of Roll, how much is that--now that you\u2019ve had some experience with it, how much more excited are you about that possibility and penetrating that micro part of the market? Then on the flipside, with the capabilities of being able to service companies globally and at huge scale, how does that expand the top end of the market?\nCarlos Rodriguez: As you know, we\u2019re a little bit different than most in the sense that we\u2019re 100% all-in on HCM, and we cut across multiple segments and also geography, so that makes us a little bit unique, so you have to get excited within segment because--like, Roll is really exciting and we\u2019re excited about that opportunity, but that is in that micro segment because if you take the other extreme example of that other client, like when we process a million--that client obviously has a million employees, and we processed their payroll and we processed a million paychecks on one day. That\u2019s a lot of small Roll clients to make up for that. They\u2019re excited about that, but Roll is excited about its role in the growth of ADP and in the marketplace in terms of our ability to compete and to create opportunities for us. It\u2019s a little hard to compare. I guess it\u2019s like when you have multiple children, you have to love them all and they\u2019re all good looking and smart and so forth, and I think that\u2019s the way I feel about Roll in the down market versus the up market versus GlobalView. They really are all, I think, performing quite well now, and I think we\u2019re excited about the opportunity in each of those market segments.  I\u2019m trying not to give you a non-answer answer, but I think--I\u2019m trying my hardest to give you something concrete, but it\u2019s exciting because these are all--I mean, the growth rate, Dany won\u2019t allow me to say it because as we were preparing for the call, if we were a start-up, we would be quoting growth rates for Roll that would make your eyes roll, but Dany won\u2019t let me say it because it\u2019s really, frankly, insignificant to a $15 billion company today, but it won\u2019t be insignificant in five or 10 years.\nMark Marcon: I guess that\u2019s what I was getting at, was on the--for example, in terms of Roll, when you first introduced it, you talked about it in a more modest manner, but it sounds like it\u2019s getting really good traction, so I was just wondering if there was some way to capture how you\u2019re thinking about how big that could eventually be. \nCarlos Rodriguez: It\u2019s definitely getting good traction. We\u2019re definitely excited about it, but again you shouldn\u2019t over--I\u2019m not trying to over-play it because we have a very large organization, and you guys need to think about how all the pieces fit together, so that it fits into our forecast. Just from a dollar impact, I hate to go back to that, that product and that segment competes against certain competitors. We feel pretty good about what we\u2019re going to be able to do there in terms of market share and growth, etc., but you should not be thinking about this as something that\u2019s going to move ADP\u2019s growth rate by one to two percentage points on the top line in the next year or two. That\u2019s just not the way the math works. I wish it did. All of these things have to work together - next gen payroll, next gen HCM, Roll, GlobalView, Celergo. There are a lot of things - PEO - that have to come together for us to get to the numbers, and we like that. We\u2019re, I think, a portfolio that, as you\u2019ve seen, we manage pretty effectively, and the combination of all of those businesses having good success, some more than others at times, I think leads to the results that we are reporting and forecasting.\nMark Marcon: Appreciate that, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with MoffetNathanson. Your line is open.\nEugene Sumuni: Thank you, good morning. Congrats on another strong quarter, guys. Wanted to ask about Wisely and your general personal finance product strategy. You highlighted the bill pay offering in your prepared remarks. Can you just remind us what are the next big milestones for this overall strategy, and I know it\u2019s a small part of your portfolio, but will you at some point maybe start providing some metrics that can help us track the growth of this area like some businesses like that provide, such as number of cardholders, frequency of transactions, the amount spent, and so on? Thank you.\nMaria Black: Yes, so happy to comment on the overall Wisely product strategy and where we\u2019re heading with the opportunity - it\u2019s incredibly exciting for us, and then we can talk through what those metrics could be to give some solid basis of growth over time.  As it relates to the overall MyWisely app and the strategy we have within the Wisely portfolio, it is really a strategy that is anchored in financial management. That financial management in the app happens through education, budgeting, savings tools, rewards. What you heard today, which you just mentioned as well, which is the launch of our bill pay feature, we believe is significant. It\u2019s exactly what we all probably use with respect to any type of an online bill pay, where you can scan the check and actually facilitate end-to-end bill processing through a mobile device, so that is all part of the MyWisely app and the overall financial management strategy - think financial wellness, etc. that we\u2019ve employed.  In addition to that, the other thing that\u2019s forthcoming is the launch of our early wage access, our EWA as we refer to it, which is really that ability for our clients\u2019 employees or employees to gain access to wages that they\u2019ve earned as they earn them, so this is also a big piece to the overall equation with respect to the overall Wisely. Things that we\u2019re monitoring actively right now, back to the question around how many cardholders, etc., certainly we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019re looking at other types of what type of cardholders are using what feature functionality. There is some data that you could look at as it relates to how many reviews we have on the app, the quality of the app certainly supersedes some of the competition in the space. We\u2019re pretty proud of the impact that our financial wellness tool, MyWisely app is creating in the market. I\u2019ll let Dany or Carlos comment on cardholder tracking and when and if we\u2019ll disclose that.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, I think we\u2019ll--I mean, that\u2019s a takeaway for us. We\u2019ll see if there\u2019s something else that we--I mean, we\u2019re always open to suggestions and trying to be open-minded about disclosure, but again, this is not the same as the conversation about Roll, but as excited as we are about Wisely, we\u2019re equally excited about things like Roll, and Wisely is much bigger than Roll. But again, relative--I hate to be a broken record, relative to the size of ADP, it wouldn\u2019t be at the top of the list of the things that are going to drive the overall results, because again, a portfolio of so many different things that have to go right and that we have to get right in order to get growth on $15 billion. I think that business is probably--I\u2019m trying to do the math in my head, it\u2019s like 2%, 3% or smaller in terms of total--actually smaller than that, even, in terms of revenue. By the way, we want that, and it is growing faster than the line average. All the things you\u2019re asking about are relevant, and those things would all help the overall growth rate of ADP, but it would be misleading--because I think others might have done that, where they make a bigger deal out of it than it really is, and maybe relative to their companies it is a big deal.  Relative to us, we have lots of other things that we have to do and that have to go right, and us trying to pretend that--you know, if we tell you this is how much we get per card and then we start giving you math that if 100% of our clients got on the card, this is how much money we would have - I mean, we don\u2019t need to do that, because that\u2019s just distracting and silly, because first of all, it\u2019s not going to happen, we\u2019re not going to get 100 overnight, and it could take some time anyway. But we will take that away and think about what, if anything, we can do to give you a little more substance around progress around Wisely, because it\u2019s exciting and we\u2019re happy about it, but it\u2019s not--there are other parts of our disclosure that would give you more indications like the things we\u2019ve been talking about - pays per control, new business bookings, all those things overall are bigger drivers of our results.\nEugene Sumuni: Got it, thank you very much, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Thank you very much, and good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but I wanted to talk just a little bit about, or ask about strategy. In the past, you\u2019ve mentioned customer service capabilities being a differentiator related to SaaS players. How should we think about the persistence of differentiated service levels as your own AI capability grows in importance and we look at the future of self service initiatives may cause your own services and service levels to look more like traditional SaaS players? I guess I\u2019m just wondering how we should be thinking about that strategically and what the implications are in the business. I recognize it probably fits well within a few of your most recent comments, like it takes a while to move the needle, but would love to get a sense of where you think you\u2019re going in those areas.\nCarlos Rodriguez: It\u2019s a great question because we--that\u2019s a topic that comes up not just among the management team, but also from the board, because we clearly see the opportunity there. Again, we have a couple of advantages coming out of the gate, like we obviously have a lot of data, so we have a lot of information that can be used to provide, I think, more automated, if you will, whether it\u2019s AI, machine learning, whatever term you want to use for it. You have to have information to be able to then monetize that or turn it into a value-add for the clients, which then can be monetized.  We spent a fair amount of time on that. We\u2019ve actually recently appointed someone to be our chief data officer, who is kind of overseeing and owning all of our data and then how we can marshal those resources to create the kinds of advantages that you\u2019re talking about, which are really advantages for our clients so that we can be able to hold onto them longer, sell them more things, etc. Everything from the simplest things, like chat bots to real true AI, I think are things that we have already deployed and I think are in the process of growing and scaling, if you will, to take advantage of, and I think some of those you\u2019ve seen around press releases, and we talked about some of them on investor day, but clearly there\u2019s a lot more opportunity in front of us that we\u2019ve already done in that area. I would say that that\u2019s a great question and a substantial opportunity for us, that to the previous point about disclosure, we have to find a better way of giving more guidance or more disclosure around how that\u2019s going and how it\u2019s being leveraged, because it\u2019s going to be meaningful, I think, over the next five to 10 years for ADP.\nJames Faucette: That\u2019s great, appreciate it Carlos.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. That question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks guys. I just wanted to start with the EPS guidance for fiscal \u201922 - I guess we\u2019re going up 1% at the midpoint, so call it $0.06. Just breaking that down, it looks like the raise in the float income expectations is about $0.04 of that, and presumably the rest  revenue outlook. I just wanted to see if that math is correct.\nCarlos Rodriguez: That sounds pretty good. I think that the theme--whether that\u2019s exactly right or not, the theme you should hear is--I mean, it\u2019s maybe a bad thing to end the call with, but you should understand that the second--we are investing, and this is not the first time you\u2019ve heard this from ADP. The opportunity in front of us is big, like our bookings are growing, the economy is growing robustly despite the noise in terms of the stock market and so forth. This is a really good environment for us, and so we are preparing ourselves, and you should expect that that is going to lead to long term improvement in, hopefully, our growth rates and in our margins and so forth.  Just don\u2019t get distracted by the short term noise, because I think if the implication is it doesn\u2019t seem like we raised the rest of whatever profit by much, the answer is you\u2019re probably right, but it\u2019s all the things we\u2019ve been talking about during the call, which is we\u2019re making sure that we keep up with the market in terms of wage growth, but we have price levers that we haven\u2019t necessarily hit yet because we\u2019re not a panicky company. We\u2019re not going to tomorrow do an unplanned price increase to our base, but we have times that are natural and normal where we will do that, but we\u2019re not going to wait to take action on wages and hiring and so forth until we get there, because that doesn\u2019t make sense. We\u2019re not some schleppy little company that needs to panic, so we\u2019re going to do the right things and if there\u2019s a timing, missed timing by a quarter or two, so be it.  We think it\u2019s still pretty damn good. When you think about the inflationary pressures we have and the fact that we\u2019re still able to deliver the results that we are delivering and able to grow the way we\u2019re delivering, we\u2019re pretty damn proud of it. But admittedly, we\u2019re feeling more pressure on the expenses now than we definitely felt, call it 18 months ago, right? It\u2019s the opposite, and this is what happens in, quote-unquote comparisons, and when, you quote-unquote lap things and all that stuff that you guys like to look at. The pandemic hit and our expenses went down because we were very careful and very frugal and very stingy in terms of hiring and so forth, and our revenues never came down as much as everyone thought and as we thought, and we now have to go back up and make sure that we\u2019re staffed, and at the same time wages started to increase and we have to now factor that into the picture. But we\u2019re feeling pretty damn good about our execution and how we\u2019re doing, but that is the way the numbers add up, is the way you described it.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay, those are all good points. Just last one from me, I wanted to see if you could elaborate a little bit on the competitive landscape, just what you\u2019re seeing down market, midmarket, enterprise-wide. Interested in just any changes in the mix or the aggressiveness of any competitors across the spectrum. Thank you.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Again, because we compete in so many different segments, there\u2019s not--I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a broad sweep--I mean, some of our competitors only compete with us in one segment, so it\u2019s hard to make a sweeping statement other than I think it\u2019s business as usual. That may not be very exciting, but I don\u2019t see--I don\u2019t know, Maria, if you see any--there\u2019s been no--I mean, I think when we look at our balance of trade, we\u2019re pretty happy about a couple of people that we\u2019ve been more focused on recently than maybe before, which we\u2019re now doing better than before on. But as usual, there\u2019s others that are now gaining ground on us, but I\u2019d say that the general environment is stable and--what is it, the rising tide lifts all boats? It feels like the industry overall has a lot of, I don\u2019t know, growth opportunity and we\u2019re all getting our fair share and trying to steal each other\u2019s share, but it\u2019s a good environment. I don\u2019t know if you have any--?\nMaria Black: I concur. I would echo the sentiment on the overall HCM space and the environment, and I don\u2019t think anything has materially changed. But we certainly intend to continue to win our fair share and more.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks guys.\nOperator: This concludes our question and answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you. Just back to the general economic conditions and what\u2019s happening in the market and so forth, which is not something that we focus on, on a day-to-day basis, but the some of the things--we did have a little bit of a discussion and some questions on capital allocation, structure and so forth, that I would just--I can\u2019t help but I\u2019m obsessed with the dividend, and I love how no one asked about the dividend. Nobody cares about the dividend, but we may be entering an environment where it might matter again, so maybe someday I\u2019ll get a question about the dividend, because I think we\u2019re in our 47th year of consecutive increases in a dividend, and I think if you go back 10 years and you look at what our cost basis of the stock was and what the dividend yield, given today\u2019s dividend, is on that cost basis five, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, this company is a money machine, and clearly capital gains are important too but the focus changes, obviously, as the market environment changes. Listen, I\u2019m not wishing a downdraft in the market - it hurts us as much as it hurts anyone else, but I like where ADP is positioned competitively and I like where we\u2019re positioned in terms of our balance sheet, our dividend, and the way we allocate capital.  But the most important thing I\u2019m proud of is our associates, because every quarter now as we get further away from--despite omicron and so forth, clearly we\u2019re in a much better place than we were before. We would not be where we are today without our associates, and I mentioned how we were understaffed for sure in the early times of the pandemic, because we felt like we had to be careful on the expense side, and as we were being careful, the workloads were increasing because of all the government regulation issues that were intended to help - and they did, all of the stimulus, and this was across the whole world. That created a ton of work for our people, of which we had fewer people, and I\u2019m incredibly grateful and will forever be indebted for people stepping up and doing whatever it took to get our clients and get us through that difficult period. I\u2019m so glad that we\u2019re able to deliver on all of our commitments, because we were, I think, one important factor besides the Amazon trucks still running and other parts of the economy still functioning. I think we played a role in helping the world economy, I think, get through the pandemic, and our associates deserve all the credit for the role they played. With that, I appreciate you listening to us, and we look forward to catching up with you again in the next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference.

            "name": "Maria Black",
            "content": "Yes, good morning, this is Maria. Thanks for the question, David, happy to comment on both. With respect to the overall performance in the quarter, as was stated in the prepared remarks, we had strong double-digit growth that did really go across our scaled offerings, specifically in the down market. We saw the strength in our Run platform, we saw the strength in our retirement solutions, definitely experienced strength in the Workforce Now platform. I\u2019ll cover off on your second question as well as we get to the press release that we just issued. Additionally in the second quarter, we also saw strength in GlobalView, so very happy with our international contribution to the quarter, so that was really the strength across the double-digit growth that we saw in employer services. As it relates to the Workforce Now press release that I think we issued in the last couple days regarding the offer that now is on a global basis, the ability for our U.S.-based and Canadian-based companies to process payroll on the Workforce Now platform across multiple countries, in partnership with our Celergo offering. Very excited to have this offering, as you could imagine. Over the course of the last decade but certainly in the last couple years, the ability for mid-market customers to really be able to support international employees on their end is a growing demand, and we\u2019re pretty excited to be able to satisfy that demand with this new offer. That\u2019s right. Yes, so happy to comment on our HCM products and how our sellers go to market to drive the combination of new business bookings between new logos as well as add-on business, our HCM products from an attached perspective. As you can imagine, a lot of the investments that we\u2019ve spoken about for several years in existing products, a lot of the investments that we\u2019re making into our existing platforms - we just talked about the new UF and the impact that\u2019s making in our down market and will continue to make, coupled with the investments that we\u2019re making into our next gen products, are all investments that are anchored in a belief that we can continue to expand the offerings to our existing clients as well as new clients. Excited about the execution on each one of these initiatives and the impact that it will make to our bookings and the mix of bookings between new logos and HCM products attached. This calendar year, that\u2019s right. Yes, so happy to comment on the overall Wisely product strategy and where we\u2019re heading with the opportunity - it\u2019s incredibly exciting for us, and then we can talk through what those metrics could be to give some solid basis of growth over time.  As it relates to the overall MyWisely app and the strategy we have within the Wisely portfolio, it is really a strategy that is anchored in financial management. That financial management in the app happens through education, budgeting, savings tools, rewards. What you heard today, which you just mentioned as well, which is the launch of our bill pay feature, we believe is significant. It\u2019s exactly what we all probably use with respect to any type of an online bill pay, where you can scan the check and actually facilitate end-to-end bill processing through a mobile device, so that is all part of the MyWisely app and the overall financial management strategy - think financial wellness, etc. that we\u2019ve employed.  In addition to that, the other thing that\u2019s forthcoming is the launch of our early wage access, our EWA as we refer to it, which is really that ability for our clients\u2019 employees or employees to gain access to wages that they\u2019ve earned as they earn them, so this is also a big piece to the overall equation with respect to the overall Wisely. Things that we\u2019re monitoring actively right now, back to the question around how many cardholders, etc., certainly we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019re looking at other types of what type of cardholders are using what feature functionality. There is some data that you could look at as it relates to how many reviews we have on the app, the quality of the app certainly supersedes some of the competition in the space. We\u2019re pretty proud of the impact that our financial wellness tool, MyWisely app is creating in the market. I\u2019ll let Dany or Carlos comment on cardholder tracking and when and if we\u2019ll disclose that. I concur. I would echo the sentiment on the overall HCM space and the environment, and I don\u2019t think anything has materially changed. But we certainly intend to continue to win our fair share and more."

            "name": "Carlos Rodriguez",
            "content": "Thank you Dany, and thank you everyone for joining our call.  We\u2019re pleased to have delivered strong second quarter results, including 9% revenue growth, 20 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion, and a 9% increase in adjusted diluted EPS, all ahead of our expectations. It remains a very dynamic and challenging business environment for our clients and prospects, but we believe the value of working with a trusted ACM partner with more than seven years of expertise is more compelling than ever, and we see evidence of this reflected in our continued sales momentum as well as our very high levels of client satisfaction and retention, which continue to drive upside to our results. As usual, let me start with some highlights from the quarter. Our employers services new business booking results were strong despite the onset of the omicron variant at the end of the quarter. We experienced a record Q2 booking level and like Q1, we were pleased to be ahead of pre-pandemic sales productivity levels. We experienced robust double-digit growth in nearly every one of our ES businesses, and as we saw earlier in the year, we experienced every stronger performance in our PEO segment, where demand is especially robust. As we outlined at our November investor day, the pandemic and the dynamic macroeconomic environment have made running HR more challenging for our clients. Today our clients navigate a tight labor market across their organizations, higher than usual worker turnover, new legislative requirements, and in many cases staffing challenges specifically within their payroll and HR departments.  The strong broad-based demand across our ES and PEO segments reflect the fact that clients of all sizes are increasingly looking for greater levels of assistance and expertise to help address their needs, in some cases seeking our intuitive yet comprehensive software offerings while in other cases seeking a more fully outsourced solution. We believe we provide extraordinary value through all business environments, and today\u2019s environment supports a continuation of a positive decades-long secular trend in global HCM. Moving onto employer services retention, we are pleased to have experienced continued strength. Although our retention in the quarter did decline very slightly versus last year\u2019s elevated level, it declined by less than we had anticipated and would have represented a record Q2 if you were to exclude last year\u2019s pandemic impacted retention levels. With overall client satisfaction once again reaching a record level this quarter, this strong retention is not surprising to us. Moreover, early January results look strong, giving us greater confidence for the rest of the year, and we are pleased to be raising our retention guidance once again. Our ES pays per control metric came in slightly better than expected at 6% growth in the quarter. We are very pleased to see the U.S. unemployment rate back below 4%, which reflects the U.S. economy\u2019s ongoing improvement and resulting strong demand for workers. Meanwhile, labor force participation is gradually recovering and as it does, we should continue to benefit from higher than usual pays per control growth. Over the first half of the fiscal year, we\u2019ve tracked ahead of our expectations and are now raising our pays per control outlook for the full year.  In the second quarter, our PEO had stellar performance once again and was well ahead of our expectations with 15% revenue growth and 16% average worksite employee growth, representing acceleration from last quarter despite a slightly harder growth comparison. Across the board strength in our PEO continues to be driven by several factors, including better than expected retention and bookings contributing to client growth, better than expected hiring within the PEO client base, further adding to worksite employee growth, and better than expected wage levels further adding to revenue growth. While some of these tailwinds will normalize over time, we remain very confident in the outlook of our PEO business over the coming years.  During our November investor day, we also outlined key aspects of our growth strategy by product and by business unit, and we are confident about sustaining healthy growth in our fast-growing businesses and optimistic about accelerating our growth in our businesses that continue to transition to our most modern offerings. One aspect of our growth strategy that we discussed is an overall greater focus on marketing, which we believe will allow us to better activate our existing scale distribution. We believe at ADP, we can deliver a lot of incremental value from tactical investments, and we look forward to sharing more in the very near future. One key product initiative we talked about during investor day that cuts across our businesses is the development of a new unified user experience, and in the second quarter we were pleased to have made further progress on this effort. As a reminder, we shared last quarter that we moved our Run client base over to the new ADP UX, and now only a quarter in, early indicators suggest that clients are in fact finding it more intuitive, resulting in fewer client service contacts.  In Europe, we have been gradually transitioning our client base over to our award-winning IHCM platform, and in Q2 we seamlessly moved those clients over to the new ADP UX. We\u2019re now very excited that just this month, we began our pilot of the new ADP user experience for Workforce Now, which when coupled with our next gen payroll engine makes for an even more differentiated offering for what is already a market-leading HCM solution in this target market. In terms of a few other highlights, I\u2019m pleased to share that we reached a new milestone by running 1 million pay slips for a single client on a single day for the first time. At the other end of the spectrum, our Roll mobile app, which serves the micro segment, continues to outperform our initial expectations. In another milestone in calendar 2021, the ADP mobile app had over 1 billion log-ins, highlighting the growing amount of direct engagement we have with employees and managers around the world. To that point, this month our return to workplace mobile solution, part of the ADP mobile app, was awarded the Business Intelligence Group\u2019s 2022 Big Innovation Award. As a final highlight, just this week we launched our bill pay feature in the Wisely app. Bill pay is free to Wisely users and fully integrated into the app, and has been a top requested feature from our user base. We believe this addition will further drive engagement and retention, and we look forward to continuing to expand the Wisely ecosystem. Overall, Q2 represented a solid outcome on both the financial front as well as with respect to key strategic initiatives. I\u2019d like to thank our associates who continue to deliver these exceptional products and outstanding service to our clients, and I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Don. I think you heard from our prepared comments that the answer was no, but when you think about the way the quarter works, the omicron really started to pick up in, I would say, middle to last December in terms of my recollection. It\u2019s really incredible how fast things have changed with this, because now we\u2019re back on the down slope in the northeast, it appears at least, in the U.S., so it\u2019s pretty fast moving. But I would say that our answer is no, we didn\u2019t see anything in the quarter that we just reported. Obviously we\u2019re now in the next quarter and it\u2019s kind of difficult to start talking about the next quarter, given we\u2019re only, I think, three weeks into it, but you\u2019ve seen probably multiple reports--I saw one this morning in the Journal about, I think it was the IMF or someone kind of lowering global growth and so forth, and some of it is obviously a result of omicron, there\u2019s probably other factors as well.  We do believe that we\u2019re not immune from these kinds of things that ripple through the economy, including omicron, but the truth is we haven\u2019t really seen a big impact yet. But if GDP growth--I think the GDP growth for the full calendar year, most people have kind of kept it in the same range, so I\u2019m guessing that people have lowered their first quarter - talking about calendar quarters now - GDP growth forecasts slightly and probably increased, because I think it\u2019s just a matter of pushing activity forward, because it does look like in a few weeks, things will start to, quote-unquote, normalize in at least a portion of the country, and then I think shortly thereafter economic activity should be robust again, as was, I think, predicted by a bunch of economists. So anyway, that\u2019s a long way of saying not really, not yet, but we\u2019re always careful to not assume that we are somehow insulated completely from what happens in the overall economy. If people are traveling a little bit less, for example our own associate population, we proactively asked--we were already back in the process of getting people back into our offices, and we went back in the other direction for about a month or two. That just lowers economic activity - people aren\u2019t driving as much, they\u2019re not going to lunch in a local area, etc., and those things have a ripple effect through the economy, but no signs of any major decrease in demand or economic activity from our numbers yet. And just in terms of a refresher, by deferrals, I think Don said in his remarks, there\u2019s a social security tax deferral. Not everyone lives day to day like us, but it was a significant stimulus--part of the stimulus package, if you will, and those social security deferrals need to be repaid half--we just went through that, which is what helped us in terms of tailwind on balances, and the other half is next December 31. That\u2019s something maybe to pencil in which would provide some support to our balances next year as well. Yes, I think what we\u2019ve been saying for probably a few quarters now, it\u2019s really not--maybe the tougher environment isn\u2019t the right term. It\u2019s tougher comparisons, because our thesis was that we\u2019d gotten some tailwind from the pandemic--there were a lot of tailwinds in a lot of areas, but one of them was in retention. There\u2019s less clients switching, and on top of that, there was also lower bankruptcy rates in down market, where it\u2019s a significant portion of the turnover of our clients is, quote-unquote, out of business, so all the government stimulus and all the low switching, I think really elevated our retention. At the same time, our NPS scores and client satisfaction and all the feedback we\u2019re getting from clients was very, very strong, so frankly it\u2019s difficult to separate the two, so we planned for some moderation in our retention as a result of those tailwinds because those tailwinds are going to go away. I think they\u2019re economically driven, and we\u2019ve seen a little bit of that in our down market. I think we\u2019ve also kind of alluded to that, that despite our continuing strong retention, it\u2019s kind of generally playing out the way we expected, which is our down market SBS is a little--is down a little bit over the previous year, but other parts obviously are holding up well, if not improving, and the net of that is better than we expected and better than we had planned. The question is, are we going to be able to hold onto all of it? Our plan of course is to hold onto all of it, and that is why you saw in Don\u2019s comments that we\u2019re making sure we have the right levels of service, the right levels of implementation, because if we can achieve the forecast we have for retention for the year, which will be ahead of what our plan and our expectations were, that has a meaningful impact on our long term growth and value creation for the company. Kevin, could you clarify the question on the extended portion, where specifically you\u2019re focused there? Well, if you\u2019re talking about balance growth, the extended strategy balance growth is actually tied more to the volatility of cash flows on a year-to-year basis, so it has to do with our forecast of what our low balance is going to be in the year versus our average balance, which is a little bit different from the client funds forecast.  Long term, yes, the extended balance would grow kind of in line with the client funds balance growth, but on a short term, year-to-year basis, there\u2019s a whole more noise. That is actually driving the difference more so than the lag effect. The lag effect that Don was referring to has more to do with the growth in the client funds balances. When the growth is particularly high, it\u2019s often hard for us to reinvest quickly given the number of opportunities there are in the market and so forth for the type of credit quality that we\u2019re seeking, but we within a couple quarters can catch up, so it\u2019s just a question of how quickly we can deploy those additional funds. I think the short answer is the net impact from our strategy, because there\u2019s also a re-classing issue in terms of how we do it, in terms of accounting and so forth, so I think the right way to look at it is really what\u2019s happening with yields, what\u2019s happening with--overall, what\u2019s happening with balance growth, and then what\u2019s the net impact of our strategy, of our client fund strategy. I think on that front, the short answer is it\u2019s looking pretty good. Just as an example, our Q1 re-investments were at about a 1% yield, so new purchases, and in Q2 they were 1.5%, so it\u2019s been--you see the same thing we\u2019ve seen. The moves in the two-years and the five-years are even more significant than the 10-years and so forth, so for us it\u2019s the--you know, when we talk long, our version of long is three, five, seven, not beyond that, just because of the way we invest our portfolio, and on that front, you could not have a better environment in terms of wage inflation, balance growth and increases in interest rates. I would say we\u2019re not ready to say anything yet about \u201923 and \u201924, but all this--there\u2019s a lot of talk about mechanics in the short term or whatnot, because I know a lot of people are focused on the short term, but we\u2019re more long term oriented and we could be in here for a multi-year tailwind finally from client funds interest in a meaningful way. Yes, listen - I\u2019ve been waiting 10 years. I had hair when I started as CEO, and I remember telling the treasurer at the time, rates have to go up next year, and then next year I said rates have to go up next year, and here we are. But this time, dammit, I\u2019m right! Well if the question is about conservatism, I\u2019ll let Don handle it. Just one other thing, I think we should also add to your point in terms of tone, we want to make sure we\u2019re clear here that we\u2019re not insulated from the world. There is no question that there is pressure on costs, particularly around wages, and we are a technology services company so we have costs around R&D and so forth. We also have costs around the service side of our business, and you\u2019ve heard in the prepared comments that Don mentioned that we\u2019ve taken some actions that are what I\u2019d call mid-cycle, so not the typical annual wage increases, because we felt we needed to do something to make sure that we held onto our people and that we were attracting the right kinds of people, so we are doing some things. Now, the good news on the other side of that coin, which I\u2019m assuming will come up later as a question but may as well address it now, like some other industries but not every other industry, we do have a fair amount of, and the industry has shown, demonstrated historically and, I think, there are some recent signs from competitors that pricing is more elastic than in many industries. This is not a commodity business, and there\u2019s a fair amount of room. The problem is you have to exercise that room very carefully because you want to remain competitive, and on and on and on. You\u2019ve heard that story from us for many years too, that we really want to win in the market, we want higher retention rates, so we can\u2019t just go around willy-nilly passing through price increases, but the fact is we can and we will if it\u2019s driven by market forces and cost increases that are experienced across the board. We\u2019re confident that our competitors will do the same thing, and some of them already are. I think it\u2019s been pretty consistent for a long time at around 50%, right? It\u2019s about half, that we kind of mine our own. It\u2019s a combination of mining our own clients, but we also mine our own sales force. Our sales force is able to bring in obviously new clients straight onto the PEO, but we also have a very large installed base that, as you alluded to, we mine. I think it\u2019s 50/50, if I\u2019m not mistaken. It hasn\u2019t really changed that much over the years. I think that\u2019s a fair point - there\u2019s a lot of things that we do that are intended to really, quote-unquote, standardize and to be able to get leverage, and this is clearly one of those where--you know, ADP historically was a little bit more fragmented in terms of our R&D, and we\u2019ve been, starting with my predecessor, I think trying to become more unified, etc., and the user experience is one of those places where there was an obvious opportunity that I think will make us better competitively and allow us to invest our money more efficiently, and there clearly is some back end benefit to that from a margin standpoint. But I would say I\u2019d be--I don\u2019t think it would be true to say that that was the primary driver. There\u2019s got to be some residual help from a margin standpoint and from an efficiency standpoint, but this is really about winning, about having the best products and having the best face to the market in terms of our--the best skin, if you will, on each of our products. It makes a difference, as you know.  We get it, we\u2019re a technology company now, and it matters a lot the experience that our--and it\u2019s not just our clients. It used to be 20, 30 years ago, it was only the clients. Now the employees of our clients are obviously touching and interacting with our products, especially with the mobile app, and this user experience stuff matters a lot in terms of engagement. Thank you. Almost all of it is in the down market and related to normalization of economic factors, like closure rates. I don\u2019t know that closure rate is the right word, but that\u2019s one of the--that\u2019s in that category, what we call--we track uncontrollable losses and controllable losses. Controllable losses would be around service and product, etc.; uncontrollable is the obvious, like bankruptcies, out of business, etc.  What happened during the pandemic, it wasn\u2019t just that bankruptcies went down. All the categories of uncontrollable losses went down, and there has been some normalization of that, not all the way back to pre-pandemic, but I would say that there\u2019s really nothing that you could read into the numbers to tell you anything other than we have fantastic service, solid NPS scores, but there is some normalization in categories, specifically more down market. Everywhere else, I think our retention rates are good to improving and solid, and in many cases better than prior years.  We have less tolerance in those other businesses because they\u2019re not as economically sensitive, so we have less tolerance for the excuse that there\u2019s going to be normalization there, because we now have a taste of what\u2019s possible in retention in the mid-market and in international and in--although international has been strong all along and in the up-market, and we just want to maintain those retention levels. But it would be foolish in the down market to assume that there won\u2019t be some economic factors and normalization - that\u2019s what you see reflected in our forecast. Yes, I think that--we\u2019re thrilled, just to be clear, but let me just give you a few, back to these comparisons in the pandemic and noise. Part of our headwind in the PEO sales, which by the way we\u2019re positive and we\u2019re good, but not as good as ES last year. I think we shared a little bit of color there that the average client size sold had come down a little bit, wages weren\u2019t growing that much, so all of those things have an impact more on the PEO than they do in ES, particularly in some of the ES units.  Those things have all turned in the other direction now, so the average size client is bigger in terms of clients sold, and that is meaningful, and then you have wage growth which flows through the PEO. It doesn\u2019t flow through ES because the billing is not as a percent of wages, whereas in the PEO it is, and so we do have a number of tailwinds that are also helping. But the most important thing, which is maybe what you\u2019re alluding to, is the average worksite employee growth, which kind of cuts through the inflation and the wage growth and all that, and that\u2019s also robust but that\u2019s getting assistance, like I just mentioned, from average size client being a little bit bigger in terms of new business bookings. Again, that\u2019s great news, but it\u2019s a little bit of a normalization because it\u2019s actually back now, so it went down from where it was pre-pandemic, and now it\u2019s back up about to where it was pre-pandemic, and hopefully, you know, you get 1% to 2% growth going forward, but right now it\u2019s more than just 1% to 2% growth. Our attach rates in general are pretty good, particularly in some categories like--we said this before, like our workforce management, we used to call it time and labor, those products tend to have high attach rates, and others have high attach rates, others have low attach rates. I think part of our opportunity for whatever the years to come is to not only sell new logos, which we\u2019re now obsessed about because we want to grow market share, but share of wallet is a huge opportunity for us. The fact is, we have very low-ish penetration still in many of our categories and many of our products. No, all I was thinking was that in some cases, if people pay us, we\u2019ll buy their companies. And then we can clean them up. I would say we had a really good, I think, first--I would call it year end, because when you get to the midmarket, which is next gen pay, as you know right now is really being sold in a portion of what we call the core part of the midmarket, so call it 50 to 150, and I think we\u2019re at--we\u2019re selling somewhere between 20%, 25% of our clients, of our new businesses coming in on the new platform, and we expect to be GA, I think it\u2019s end of calendar-- End of calendar year, so that\u2019s kind of what we talked about at investor day. I would say that, call it December-January sales season, because a lot of those clients, they want to start clean on January 1, so it\u2019s a fairly important point of the year in terms of judging where you are in terms of sales results and so forth, and we had a fairly good, I think, number of starts. We were happy, I would say, with the early January, late December, what I would starts results - in other words, those are clients that we sold previously, that we got started and we have up and running.  We try and avoid getting into specifics of how many clients, because then every quarter you guys are going to ask us, but I\u2019d say that that\u2019s going really well and we\u2019re on track for this GA by the end of the calendar quarter, and then we had a good start season for end of December, beginning of January. As you know, we\u2019re a little bit different than most in the sense that we\u2019re 100% all-in on HCM, and we cut across multiple segments and also geography, so that makes us a little bit unique, so you have to get excited within segment because--like, Roll is really exciting and we\u2019re excited about that opportunity, but that is in that micro segment because if you take the other extreme example of that other client, like when we process a million--that client obviously has a million employees, and we processed their payroll and we processed a million paychecks on one day. That\u2019s a lot of small Roll clients to make up for that. They\u2019re excited about that, but Roll is excited about its role in the growth of ADP and in the marketplace in terms of our ability to compete and to create opportunities for us. It\u2019s a little hard to compare. I guess it\u2019s like when you have multiple children, you have to love them all and they\u2019re all good looking and smart and so forth, and I think that\u2019s the way I feel about Roll in the down market versus the up market versus GlobalView. They really are all, I think, performing quite well now, and I think we\u2019re excited about the opportunity in each of those market segments.  I\u2019m trying not to give you a non-answer answer, but I think--I\u2019m trying my hardest to give you something concrete, but it\u2019s exciting because these are all--I mean, the growth rate, Dany won\u2019t allow me to say it because as we were preparing for the call, if we were a start-up, we would be quoting growth rates for Roll that would make your eyes roll, but Dany won\u2019t let me say it because it\u2019s really, frankly, insignificant to a $15 billion company today, but it won\u2019t be insignificant in five or 10 years. It\u2019s definitely getting good traction. We\u2019re definitely excited about it, but again you shouldn\u2019t over--I\u2019m not trying to over-play it because we have a very large organization, and you guys need to think about how all the pieces fit together, so that it fits into our forecast. Just from a dollar impact, I hate to go back to that, that product and that segment competes against certain competitors. We feel pretty good about what we\u2019re going to be able to do there in terms of market share and growth, etc., but you should not be thinking about this as something that\u2019s going to move ADP\u2019s growth rate by one to two percentage points on the top line in the next year or two. That\u2019s just not the way the math works. I wish it did. All of these things have to work together - next gen payroll, next gen HCM, Roll, GlobalView, Celergo. There are a lot of things - PEO - that have to come together for us to get to the numbers, and we like that. We\u2019re, I think, a portfolio that, as you\u2019ve seen, we manage pretty effectively, and the combination of all of those businesses having good success, some more than others at times, I think leads to the results that we are reporting and forecasting. Yes, I think we\u2019ll--I mean, that\u2019s a takeaway for us. We\u2019ll see if there\u2019s something else that we--I mean, we\u2019re always open to suggestions and trying to be open-minded about disclosure, but again, this is not the same as the conversation about Roll, but as excited as we are about Wisely, we\u2019re equally excited about things like Roll, and Wisely is much bigger than Roll. But again, relative--I hate to be a broken record, relative to the size of ADP, it wouldn\u2019t be at the top of the list of the things that are going to drive the overall results, because again, a portfolio of so many different things that have to go right and that we have to get right in order to get growth on $15 billion. I think that business is probably--I\u2019m trying to do the math in my head, it\u2019s like 2%, 3% or smaller in terms of total--actually smaller than that, even, in terms of revenue. By the way, we want that, and it is growing faster than the line average. All the things you\u2019re asking about are relevant, and those things would all help the overall growth rate of ADP, but it would be misleading--because I think others might have done that, where they make a bigger deal out of it than it really is, and maybe relative to their companies it is a big deal.  Relative to us, we have lots of other things that we have to do and that have to go right, and us trying to pretend that--you know, if we tell you this is how much we get per card and then we start giving you math that if 100% of our clients got on the card, this is how much money we would have - I mean, we don\u2019t need to do that, because that\u2019s just distracting and silly, because first of all, it\u2019s not going to happen, we\u2019re not going to get 100 overnight, and it could take some time anyway. But we will take that away and think about what, if anything, we can do to give you a little more substance around progress around Wisely, because it\u2019s exciting and we\u2019re happy about it, but it\u2019s not--there are other parts of our disclosure that would give you more indications like the things we\u2019ve been talking about - pays per control, new business bookings, all those things overall are bigger drivers of our results. It\u2019s a great question because we--that\u2019s a topic that comes up not just among the management team, but also from the board, because we clearly see the opportunity there. Again, we have a couple of advantages coming out of the gate, like we obviously have a lot of data, so we have a lot of information that can be used to provide, I think, more automated, if you will, whether it\u2019s AI, machine learning, whatever term you want to use for it. You have to have information to be able to then monetize that or turn it into a value-add for the clients, which then can be monetized.  We spent a fair amount of time on that. We\u2019ve actually recently appointed someone to be our chief data officer, who is kind of overseeing and owning all of our data and then how we can marshal those resources to create the kinds of advantages that you\u2019re talking about, which are really advantages for our clients so that we can be able to hold onto them longer, sell them more things, etc. Everything from the simplest things, like chat bots to real true AI, I think are things that we have already deployed and I think are in the process of growing and scaling, if you will, to take advantage of, and I think some of those you\u2019ve seen around press releases, and we talked about some of them on investor day, but clearly there\u2019s a lot more opportunity in front of us that we\u2019ve already done in that area. I would say that that\u2019s a great question and a substantial opportunity for us, that to the previous point about disclosure, we have to find a better way of giving more guidance or more disclosure around how that\u2019s going and how it\u2019s being leveraged, because it\u2019s going to be meaningful, I think, over the next five to 10 years for ADP. That sounds pretty good. I think that the theme--whether that\u2019s exactly right or not, the theme you should hear is--I mean, it\u2019s maybe a bad thing to end the call with, but you should understand that the second--we are investing, and this is not the first time you\u2019ve heard this from ADP. The opportunity in front of us is big, like our bookings are growing, the economy is growing robustly despite the noise in terms of the stock market and so forth. This is a really good environment for us, and so we are preparing ourselves, and you should expect that that is going to lead to long term improvement in, hopefully, our growth rates and in our margins and so forth.  Just don\u2019t get distracted by the short term noise, because I think if the implication is it doesn\u2019t seem like we raised the rest of whatever profit by much, the answer is you\u2019re probably right, but it\u2019s all the things we\u2019ve been talking about during the call, which is we\u2019re making sure that we keep up with the market in terms of wage growth, but we have price levers that we haven\u2019t necessarily hit yet because we\u2019re not a panicky company. We\u2019re not going to tomorrow do an unplanned price increase to our base, but we have times that are natural and normal where we will do that, but we\u2019re not going to wait to take action on wages and hiring and so forth until we get there, because that doesn\u2019t make sense. We\u2019re not some schleppy little company that needs to panic, so we\u2019re going to do the right things and if there\u2019s a timing, missed timing by a quarter or two, so be it.  We think it\u2019s still pretty damn good. When you think about the inflationary pressures we have and the fact that we\u2019re still able to deliver the results that we are delivering and able to grow the way we\u2019re delivering, we\u2019re pretty damn proud of it. But admittedly, we\u2019re feeling more pressure on the expenses now than we definitely felt, call it 18 months ago, right? It\u2019s the opposite, and this is what happens in, quote-unquote comparisons, and when, you quote-unquote lap things and all that stuff that you guys like to look at. The pandemic hit and our expenses went down because we were very careful and very frugal and very stingy in terms of hiring and so forth, and our revenues never came down as much as everyone thought and as we thought, and we now have to go back up and make sure that we\u2019re staffed, and at the same time wages started to increase and we have to now factor that into the picture. But we\u2019re feeling pretty damn good about our execution and how we\u2019re doing, but that is the way the numbers add up, is the way you described it. Again, because we compete in so many different segments, there\u2019s not--I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a broad sweep--I mean, some of our competitors only compete with us in one segment, so it\u2019s hard to make a sweeping statement other than I think it\u2019s business as usual. That may not be very exciting, but I don\u2019t see--I don\u2019t know, Maria, if you see any--there\u2019s been no--I mean, I think when we look at our balance of trade, we\u2019re pretty happy about a couple of people that we\u2019ve been more focused on recently than maybe before, which we\u2019re now doing better than before on. But as usual, there\u2019s others that are now gaining ground on us, but I\u2019d say that the general environment is stable and--what is it, the rising tide lifts all boats? It feels like the industry overall has a lot of, I don\u2019t know, growth opportunity and we\u2019re all getting our fair share and trying to steal each other\u2019s share, but it\u2019s a good environment. I don\u2019t know if you have any--? Thank you. Just back to the general economic conditions and what\u2019s happening in the market and so forth, which is not something that we focus on, on a day-to-day basis, but the some of the things--we did have a little bit of a discussion and some questions on capital allocation, structure and so forth, that I would just--I can\u2019t help but I\u2019m obsessed with the dividend, and I love how no one asked about the dividend. Nobody cares about the dividend, but we may be entering an environment where it might matter again, so maybe someday I\u2019ll get a question about the dividend, because I think we\u2019re in our 47th year of consecutive increases in a dividend, and I think if you go back 10 years and you look at what our cost basis of the stock was and what the dividend yield, given today\u2019s dividend, is on that cost basis five, 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, this company is a money machine, and clearly capital gains are important too but the focus changes, obviously, as the market environment changes. Listen, I\u2019m not wishing a downdraft in the market - it hurts us as much as it hurts anyone else, but I like where ADP is positioned competitively and I like where we\u2019re positioned in terms of our balance sheet, our dividend, and the way we allocate capital.  But the most important thing I\u2019m proud of is our associates, because every quarter now as we get further away from--despite omicron and so forth, clearly we\u2019re in a much better place than we were before. We would not be where we are today without our associates, and I mentioned how we were understaffed for sure in the early times of the pandemic, because we felt like we had to be careful on the expense side, and as we were being careful, the workloads were increasing because of all the government regulation issues that were intended to help - and they did, all of the stimulus, and this was across the whole world. That created a ton of work for our people, of which we had fewer people, and I\u2019m incredibly grateful and will forever be indebted for people stepping up and doing whatever it took to get our clients and get us through that difficult period. I\u2019m so glad that we\u2019re able to deliver on all of our commitments, because we were, I think, one important factor besides the Amazon trucks still running and other parts of the economy still functioning. I think we played a role in helping the world economy, I think, get through the pandemic, and our associates deserve all the credit for the role they played. With that, I appreciate you listening to us, and we look forward to catching up with you again in the next quarter. Thank you."

            "name": "Don McGuire",
            "content": "Thank you Carlos, and good morning everyone.  In the second quarter, we delivered 9% revenue growth on both a reported and organic constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBIT margin was up 20 basis points, better than planned, and supported by our better than expected revenue growth, offset partially by increased PEO pass-throughs and headcount growth in our implementation and service organizations. I\u2019ll share more on this last point when I discuss our outlook. Our tax rate was up slightly in the quarter versus last year, driven by the lapping of a one-time international tax benefit we experienced last year. When including the benefit from share repurchases, we had a 9% increase in our adjusted diluted earnings per share.  Moving onto the segments, our employer services revenue increased 6% on a reported basis and 7% on an organic constant currency basis. In addition to the strong bookings, retention trends, and pays per control performance Carlos outlined, our client funds interest grew for the first time since the pandemic started as lower average yield was offset by a tremendous 28% balance growth. This growth included some benefit from the lapping of last year\u2019s deferred employer social security taxes and incremental benefit from the repayment of a portion of those employers\u2019 social security taxes, which together contributed several points of growth in addition to the already robust growth from higher client count, employment growth, and higher wages. Our ES margin increased 40 basis points, ahead of our expectations for the quarter and supported by better than expected revenue performance.  Moving on, our PEO continued to deliver exceptional performance with 15% revenue growth in the quarter. Average worksite employees accelerated to 16% year-over-year growth and reached 660,000 for the quarter. Key contributors were strong bookings and retention, as well as very healthy pays per control growth within the PEO client base. Revenues excluding zero-margin pass-throughs grew 18%, which was driven by worksite employee growth as well as higher average wages and higher SUI revenues per worksite employee. PEO margin was down 10 basis points in the quarter. Included in that figure was pressure from workers\u2019 comp and SUI expenses due primarily to worker mix and wages.  Moving on to our updated outlook for the year, for ES revenues we are narrowing our guidance and now expect growth of about 6%, the upper end of our previous guidance range of 5% to 6%. The primary drivers for our higher outlook are the stronger Q2 performance, our higher client funds interest outlook for the year, and higher pays per control growth, partially offset by an expectation from incremental FX headwind in the back half of this year on the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar.  For our client funds interest revenue, we\u2019re raising our outlook by $20 million to a range of $440 million to $450 million. Like last quarter, we\u2019re raising our balance growth assumption meaningfully to now expect growth of 18% to 20%, whereas our client funds yield expectation is unchanged despite the improvement in interest rates. This is primarily because our stronger than previously expected balance performance creates a temporary lag with greater short term investments before we purchase higher yielding fixed rate securities. For U.S. pays per control, we\u2019re raising our outlook by 1% to now expect 5% to 6% growth. We continue to expect that a gradual ongoing recovery in labor force participation will support job growth, and the first half of the year was a bit ahead of expectations.  In addition to client funds and pays per control, we are raising our retention guidance slightly and now expect it to be down 40 basis points for the year. Although we still anticipate some normalization in client switching activity, trends so far this year have been very positive, and January is looking like a continuation of that same strength. One thing we\u2019re not changing at this time is our ES booking guidance. As Carlos outlined, our Q2 performance was strong, but bookings is one place where the evolving pandemic conditions and the omicron variant has potential to create noise, as we saw at the outset of the pandemic. Although we haven\u2019t seen a material impact at this time, we still think it\u2019s prudent to maintain a wide range of outcomes in our guidance. For our ES margin, we are making no change to our outlook of up 75 to 100 basis points. Although we are raising our revenue guidance and although some of that is coming from high margin revenues, like client funds interest and pays per control, at the same time we are now more fully caught up on implementation and service headcount after running a bit behind earlier this year and late last year. This investment in implementation and service teams is critical both because the current year-end period is important to our clients and their employees, and also as we look to get ahead of the needs of our growing client base. With the continued outperformance in retention, we\u2019re now planning to grow our implementation and service teams slightly more than we had previously planned as we exit this fiscal year.  In addition to this growth in personnel, we also took one-time compensation actions across our organization in recognition of broader inflation trends in the market. The incremental expenses associated with those actions are now included in our outlook. Although this tight labor market has created its own set of challenges for most companies, we are very pleased to have been able to grow our organization as much as we did these past few months, and the wage increases we layered in give us confidence regarding our staffing levels at a busy time of year. We are also pleased to have been able to support those changes without detriment to our existing guidance ranges. Moving onto the PEO, following the strong first half trends in both client growth and worksite employee growth, we are now expecting average worksite employees to grow 13% to 15%, and we are likewise raising our guidance for PEO revenues and revenues excluding zero-margin pass-throughs by two percentage points each. Our outlook will continue to be sensitive to employment trends within our PEO client base, as well as bookings and retention performance, so although we are currently contemplating growth to be a bit lower in the back half of the year, we could continue to see upside if the current robust trends persist. For PEO margin, we are making no change to our guidance of flat to down 50 basis points for the year. Although we are raising our revenue guidance, we are at the same time expecting higher SUI and workers\u2019 comp expenses to create offsetting margin pressure. Putting it all together for our consolidated outlook, we now expect revenue to grow 8% to 9%. For adjusted EBIT margin, we continue to expect an increase of 50 to 75 basis points. As we shared earlier this year, we expect our margin improvement to be concentrated in the fourth quarter and expect our margin to be down in Q3, particularly following the recent personnel growth and wage increases. We\u2019re making no change to our tax rate assumption. With these changes, we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 12% to 14%.  Thank you, and I\u2019ll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A. Yes, we have had some growth. Certainly wages were a little bit of that, but also as we said in the prepared remarks, the big driver was the lapping from last year with the deferral, so certainly the deferrals represented a few points in the growth of those balances in the quarter, although even the deferrals were only for a few number of days towards the end of the month of December.  Certainly we look at those, but as we said, we do expect the balance growth to continue and we expect it to be firm based on the pays per control and the increase in number of people working for our clients. I think that\u2019s the biggest driver. Yes, why don\u2019t I start with the second question first on the rate environment and what that means for us. Generally speaking, as you know, when the fund balances increase rapidly, we have to invest in short term items or short term instruments until we have the opportunity to invest in longer term instruments, and as a result, we don\u2019t see as much pick-up as we would like to see. But I can certainly give you some sensitivity with respect to if we had a 25 basis point improvement in the rates in our short term investments only, that would translate into about $9 million of EBIT on a 12-month basis, so not hugely significant. On the other hand, if we saw that both in the short and the intermediate term, that 25 basis points over a 12-month period would translate into about $23 million of impact before taxes, so certainly that becomes meaningful. As we look to invest those funds longer term and as rates continue to go in what we\u2019d say--I guess what we\u2019d say is a better direction, I think we have some opportunity in the future; but at this point in time, we think that we\u2019re not going to see a huge amount of improvement in the client fund interest over the balance of the second half. What we have talked about is in the forecast today. Yes, so I think the answer is that we have got a pretty reasonable forecast in front of us, so I think we\u2019re not being terribly conservative. But I think what you should consider, though, is that we raised our revenue by $150 million from the prior--from the prior forecast, and we\u2019ve also raised our expenses by $115 million. If you start to break down those expenses, that $115 million of expense increase, you come pretty quickly to PEO pass-throughs - we had $48 million of that, so $48 million of that expense increase is really having a bit of a drag on our margins. Otherwise, I think our margins clearly would be better, but that\u2019s really what\u2019s preventing us, and that\u2019s the reason we haven\u2019t been able to do more on the margins. But I do think that all in, we\u2019ve done a really good job of baking things into our guidance and firming up the expectations we set. Yes, I think that there\u2019s always things flowing across everybody\u2019s desk and evaluations being done of opportunities, etc. While it\u2019s true that the last few weeks haven\u2019t been kind to some companies, I don\u2019t we\u2019ve really changed our objectives, and our objective is to make sure that anything that we seriously consider and we pursue has to fit the portfolio, so whether it\u2019s--it just has to be either a geography extension of what we currently have or it has to be something that\u2019s filling a product niche, and so we\u2019re going to continue to work by those guidelines, if you will. If things become more affordable and something falls into those categories, certainly we\u2019ll take the opportunity to look more seriously or to look a bit harder than we might have, say, three or four months ago. I don\u2019t know, Carlos, if you want to expand on that?"

After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  I'll now turn the conference over to Mr. Daniel Hussain, Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanyal Hussain: Thank you Michelle. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to ADP's first quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings calls. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our President and CEO and Don Maguire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe is useful to investors.  And that includes the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements, that refer to future events and involve some risks. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results, to differ materially from our current expectations. And with that, let me turn it over to Carlos. Thank you, Danny. And thank you, everyone for joining our call. I'd like to start by welcoming Don Mcguire, our new CFO. Don has been with ADP since 1998, when he joined the ADP Canada Team as a VP of Finance. He's held a series of roles with increasing responsibility, most recently serving as President of our international business, where he's done a phenomenal job of driving growth and profitability in a very complex environment. I know he's looking forward to meeting all of you.\nCarlos Rodriguez : Now, moving on to the quarter. We're pleased to have delivered a very strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth and 140 basis points of margin expansion, resulting in 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. While we did expect our Q1 revenue growth to be above our prior full-year guidance range, this result was still above our initial forecast and underscores the strong position, we are in as we emerge from the pandemic. I'll let Don go through the details after I cover some highlights. Our ES new business bookings results for very strong, representing another record Q1 bookings amount. And we're ahead of our expectations, but our performance driven by continued strength in our HR portfolio, in our international business. With this impressive bookings performance across the enterprise, we're pleased to raise our ES bookings guidance for the year after just one quarter, as we're now feeling even more confident about our sales momentum. Even stronger was our CEO bookings performance, which was also well ahead of our expectations.  And a key reason that we are raising our guidance for average worksite employee growth for the year, as Don will outline for you. As you will recall, we have been sharing our sales productivity trends over the course of the pandemic and I'm pleased to report that in Q1 we were well above pre -pandemic levels. We reached this result several months sooner than we expected, and we expect us to continue as we look ahead. Our ES retention remained incredibly strong as well. As we shared last quarter, we believed it was reasonable to assume a slight step back and retention from the record 92.2% level we experienced last year.  But in Q1, we did not see meaningful deterioration. Instead, we actually saw further improvement in our overall ES retention to a new record Q1 level, despite amongst decline in our small business division, where out of business losses started to trend back to more normal levels compared to the below normal levels last year. We're continuing to assume a slight decline in our retention outlook for the year. But clearly, we are pleased with our performance so far in the upward revision in our retention outlook reflect the strong Q1 performance. Our ESP pays per control was solid with 7% growth in the quarter, about in line with our expectations. We feel that a number of questions these pass over months about what we think might drive workers back until the labor force.  While we don't have an answer to that question, what we can tell you is that we continue to see positive trends. Our clients are eager to hire and we are seeing workers returned to the labor force, even if it's gradual. As a result, we expect to benefit from above-normal and above-normal level of pays per control growth over the course of the year. In addition to the very strong ES performance, our PEO delivered another stellar quarter with 15% revenue growth and 15% average worksite - employee growth.  Even better than the high expectations we had coming into the quarter. There were multiple drivers to the outlook performance in the PEO, including the strong level of hiring within the client base, resilient retention, and the improved bookings performance I mentioned earlier. We're very pleased with the momentum we see building in the PEO. And we're raising our full-year guidance accordingly. In addition to the financial highlights, there are a few product highlights I wanted to share with you. First, I'm excited to share that we completed the initial roll out of our new user experience for RUN.  As we shared with you last quarter, this represents the most comprehensive refresh we've done since the launch of RUN. And we're very proud that in a matter of a quarter, we were able to seamlessly move hundreds of thousands of clients to a new and better user experience. Early signs indicate the client satisfaction scores to trend even higher than the record levels we already have in our small business division. So it's a really great outcome and represents a very strong execution by the team. I'd like to also share that at the Annual HR Tech Conference a few weeks ago, our innovative diversity, equity and inclusion tool on a DataCloud platform was named a top HR product.  This recognition adds to ADP's longstanding history of award wins at the conference, marking an unprecedented seven consecutive year ADP has been honored for its innovative HCM Technology. You can probably talk from the number of times we've highlighted DataCloud that our velocity of innovation has increased significantly there. With this  solution as an example, we've seen over 50% of active users of the solution take action and realized positive impact on their  measures.  I'm proud that we provide solutions that drive real positive change for our clients. The 7 year track record demonstrates that innovation is part of ADP's DNA. And then we have a strong growing agile R&D team committed to delivering solutions in the market that continue to push the boundary of what HCM solutions can do for employers and employees. As I said before, we're very pleased with a fantastic start to the year. We look forward to sharing even more of the ADP story with you at the upcoming Investor Day in November. And now I will turn the call over to Dan for more detail on the quarter and the outlook.\nDon Mcguire : Thank you, Carlos and everyone on the call good morning. And nice to meet you. Our first quarter represented a strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth on both a reported and organic constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was up a 140 basis points much better than expected, and was supported by higher revenue and overall cost containment. Our tax rate was up slightly in the quarter versus last year. But we also benefited from the elevated pace of share repurchases following our debt issuance in May, combined, those factors contributed to a 17% increase in our adjusted diluted earnings per share.  Moving onto the segments, our Employer Services revenue increased 8% on a reported and organic constant currency basis. Our strong Q1, ES bookings guidance performance, and record retention contributed to this performance. Though, as a reminder, we did continue to lap some of the lower revenues we had last year in some of our volume-related businesses, including recruiting and background screening. Our clients finding interest represented only a slight headwind in the quarter, as our 40 point, basis point decline in average yield was offset by fantastic balanced growth of 22%, driven by client growth and planner growth, higher wages and the lapping of the payroll tax deferral last year.  ES margin increased 150 basis points on strong revenue performance and overall cost containment. As Carlos mentioned, our PEO had another terrific quarter. Average worksite employees increased 15% year-over-year to $629,000 in revenues, excluding zero margin pass - throughs from 20%, supported once again, by favorable mix trends within the PEO employee base, as well as improving SUI rates. Total PEO revenue grew 15%, which included a modest drag from lower zero margin pass-through growth and worksite employee growth as expected. PEO margin was up 70 basis points in the quarter driven by operating leverage. Overall, our Q1 results reflect a very strong start to the year and delivered ahead of our expectations on practically all fronts. Let me now turn to our updated outlook for Fiscal 2022 for ES revenues, we now expect growth for 5% to 6% which we're raising 50 basis points at the midpoint. This is driven by several underlying factors.  We're raising our expected range of ES new bookings growth to 12 to 16%. As we mentioned, we had a better-than-expected performance in Q1 and reached pre -pandemic productivity earlier than we had fore - casted. We haven't made significant changes to our rest of year outlook at this point, but if momentum remains as strong as we've seen it then we may see opportunity to deliver additional upside. We're also raising our ES retention and we're now assuming a decline of 50 basis points off of FY21 all-time highs versus our prior outlook of a decline of 75 basis points. As with bookings, this is primarily a function of the strong Q1 performance. Our continued assumption is that as clients continue to re-engage in the marketplace, we may experience a slight decline over the course of the year. We expect to have significantly more clarity once we get through the calendar year-end period. Where we typically see most of the switching activity. For U.S. pays per control. we're making no change to our outlook of 4% to 5% growth. We continue to expect a gradual recovery in the overall labor market, and the 7% growth in Q1 was about in line with our expectations.  And then for our client funds interest revenue, we're raising our outlook by about $15 million to a range of $420 to $430 million, as we're raising our balanced growth assumptions by about 4%, to growth of 12 to 14%. Our outlook for client funds yield meanwhile is unchanged despite the improvement in the yield environment. Primarily, as our stronger balanced performance actually created a temporary mix shift to overnight investments until new securities are gradually purchased. But that said the favorable shift in the yield curve is clearly helpful to us and we'll certainly benefit our multiyear client funds outlook, all else equal.  For ES margin, we now expect an increase of about 75 to 100 basis points, up from our prior range of 50 to 75 basis points. While we did outperform meaningfully on margin in Q1, we're also seeing some additional expenses over the rest of the year, including higher headcount in our outsourcing businesses. Meanwhile, we continue to expect transformation initiative benefits, including our digital transformation to offset a year-over-year increase in facilities, T&E expenses, and other return to office expenses.  Moving onto the PEO, we now expect PEO revenues to grow 11 to 13%. Average worksite employees to grow 11 to 13% and revenues excluding 0 margin pass - throughs to grow 12 to 14%. This 2% point raise across-the-board is a function of both our strong Q1 bookings and overall performance, as well as an expectation from stronger hiring within our PEO base to contribute over the remainder of the year. RPO was very well-positioned to capitalize on growing levels of client demand coming out of the pandemic. And if we continue to drive outside booking performance over the rest of that of the year, that could represent further upside to our outlook. Following our strong start to the year, we now expect a range of flat to down 50 basis points for the year, for an improvement from our prior expectation of down 25 to 75 basis points on our margin. As a reminder, we are growing over a very strong margin results in fiscal 2021 and are also expecting elevated selling expenses this year from strong bookings performance, Turning them all together for our consolidated outlook, we now expect revenue to grow 7% to 8%. Following the strong 10% Q1 performance, we now expect the remaining quarters to grow closer to 7%, which is higher than our prior forecast.  For adjusted EBITDA margin, we now expect an increase of 50 to 75 basis points. As we shared last quarter, we expect our margin improvement to be back-half-weighted. Most specifically, in the Fourth Quarter. Our current expectation is for a slight margin decline in Q2 and Q3. We're making no change to our tax rate assumption. And with these changes, we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 11% to 13%, as I think you've heard us say a couple of times now we are very pleased with our Q1 results and we're happy to be raising our guidance this early in the year.  This is still a dynamic environment, and there are a wide range of potential outcomes. And we believe our guidance is appropriately balanced given these conditions. However, should our associates continue to drive better-than-expected sales results, client satisfaction, efficiency, and service and implementation. We would see opportunity to deliver additional upside to our outlook. Before to move in Q&A I wanted to share 2 things. First, I look forward to meeting everyone perhaps virtually for now. But eventually in-person as we get back out on the road to meet our shareholders and the investment community. And second is that we are very much looking forward to our upcoming Investor Day in a couple of weeks on November 15th. Having run one of our largest businesses for years, I can tell you there is always much happening here at ADP on the ground. And although it all tends to roll up to a very stable financial picture, I can tell you there's a lot of excitement among our associates for the things they're working on. We hope to share some of that excitement with you in November. And with that, I will now turn it back over to the Operator for Q&A.\nOperator:  We'll take our first question from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions, congrats on the really strong start to the new fiscal year. So Carlos, maybe I want unpack the drivers to the strength on the new bookings side, I know productivity is clearly one, but how should we think about -- how should we think about the product side and within the product portfolio where that strength was in terms of driving new bookings?\nCarlos Rodriguez : So we -- even though what we really talked about is ES bookings, just want to start by saying that the PEO Bookings were incredibly strong. I don't know how else to put it. So I call it orders of magnitude in terms of growth rate higher than even the ES bookings growth for the quarter. That was really good to see.  So that's kind of a sign to your question about products that I think the market is really searching for solutions coming out of this pandemic, that helped them with obviously people issues and sort of, but there's also a talent for -- so people are looking to obviously attract and retain people in this environment where every Company, including ADP, is going through some of these challenged in terms of retracting our own internal talent.  And then you have another dynamic which is, if there are shortages of labor in various categories there we're hearing that there's also shortages of talent in kind of HCM category in general that should create a little bit of an advantage for the clinical outsourcers, right? So as you know, our model is, we provide great technology and software, but we also do the back-office work and we take accountability for outcomes. And I think when people are struggling to hire people to do the work in their HR department, or their payroll department, or their benefits department, we're here to help.  And so I think those outsourcing solutions are getting a lot of tailwind. We also saw because of the easy comps and I think you've heard it in Dan 's comments. Some of the things like our recruitment process outsourcing business and our screening and selection business, which we're really at very low booking levels last year at the same time, have rebounded off for obvious reasons, incredibly well.  But having said that, it was really across the board. We had very strong growth in workforce. Now, we had very strong growth in the up-market. We had strong growth even in a down-market. Although last at the same time, I think we mentioned that we had when we call client-base acquisition which is not technically M&A deal, but we were able to buy and large book of business that we converted, that really some of that flowed through our bookings. So I'd made that comparison a little harder on the SBS side, but if you back that out, it was equally strong on the SBS side as well. I would say that could give you a little bit of color, but it really was across the board.  It just shows how connected we are to the economy and GDP when it comes to bookings, which is something that we've had the theory here for some -- for some years now, and we just have a very strong recovery in a very strong economy. And it's a great environment for our sales force.\nSamad Samana: That's very helpful. And then, Don Maguire, maybe one for you on the retention side. So obviously it's -- it's really impactful into to raise the outlook one quarter and I think signals the strength that you're seeing. But just help unpack the slight uptick in the SMB side moving a little bit more towards normal in terms of business failure. Should we think that the offset there is even better-than-expected retention in the mid-market, or on the enterprise side? Can you maybe help us think about it across the customer size spectrum? How to balance those different moving parts?\nDon Mcguire : Yes. Sure. I think it's fair to say and we commented on it that the retention is at an all-time record for our Q1. So that's fantastic and better than we had expected. The expectation as we went into the year was to see particularly in the smaller business statement, to see that slipped back a little. And indeed it has, but it hasn't slipped back nearly to the extent that we had anticipated.  So we're even better there against what we had previously thought. Of course, then that means that we did have and continue to have good retention levels in the mid-market and the upmarket. So we expect that to -- we expect that to continue. However, as you know the cyclicality of our business and the seasonality of our business. We will need to get through the calendar year end, which is when we see most of the switching activity because of the drivers in new starts the year etc. So we are positive and we did take our retention estimate up for the year and we'll see if it holds and perhaps it's better than we expected.\nSamad Samana: Great, thanks. And I look forward to seeing at the stand person and a few weeks.\nDon Mcguire : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. This is actually may hear about on for Jason. Don, firstly, congratulations on the role. Maybe you can talk a little bit about your priorities in the CFO role and how they could maybe look a little different than on the . And just relatedly, should we expect an update, the multiyear targets at next year's Analyst Day. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nDon Mcguire : Yes. So I guess what I would say is I've been with ADP for a long time now. And I guess what I observed in the roughly 23 years I've been with this Company is that ADP has always had a very strong financial organization with a strong finance leader. And I want to make sure that we continue that. I am sure we will. I think that the priorities that we have are well set out in our Strat plan previous Investor Days, etc. So we'll probably provide along with an update on those things that when we get together on November the 15th. But let's wait until then and I don't think you're going to see any dramatic changes. We pretty much have a well-discussed, and well-disclosed trajectory, and plan, and we will update you on that on November the 15th.\nJason Kupferberg: Understood. Thank you. And then just if I could ask about just sales for spend, just clearly seeing some very strong momentum in the market. So I was wondering if you have any plans for sales force growth in Fiscal 2022? And which part of the market those ads would be concentrated in. Also anything notable to call out in terms of just the mix of new logos versus cross-sells in your bookings for the quarter or in the forecast. Thank you.\nCarlos Rodriguez : I think in this kind of environment, given the very first comments we made about the economy, and you have both the economy of the tailwind and you have now in the U.S. I think an administration that is kind of more inclined to regulation into, particularly employer regulation. And so you have, I think a very strong backdrop for what I would say is the foreseeable future. In that environment, historically, what ADP would do is we would add as much sales capacity as possible.  That doesn't mean that we indiscriminately hire because we have people to hire and onboard and train and so forth. And we have to make those people effective. But I would say that we have a strong appetite for growing our sales force, but also for growing our investment in marketing. Whether it's digital marketing or more traditional advertising. And that's exactly what we plan to do. Having said that, I would tell you that we've had challenges like everyone else, in terms of hiring, it's a very difficult labor market.  So I hope that we can fulfill those expectations, those dreams, if you will, of growing our sales force as fast as possible. But that's the only thing that I could see getting in the way. We obviously have the capital, we have the I think the desire and we have, I think the experience to be able to execute once we hire those people to get the sales, get the clients implemented, and then hopefully derive the benefits of that revenue for, in many cases 15-20 years, depending on which business unit you're in. And so I guess I would say strong appetite for both headcount growth, but also other investments in sales. Whether it's marketing, digital marketing, sales tools, all across-the-board.\nJason Kupferberg: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-jian Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien Jian Huang: Thanks so much. Good results here. Just on the PEO side, I'm curious how much of the general improvement there is secular versus cyclical? And I know Carlos, you talked about putting more sales energy there as well. Just curious, what's changed?\nCarlos Rodriguez : So the risk of -- because we had a strong feeling that the PEO business was going to be strong coming out of the pandemic. Because it's been strong coming out of prior economical recession. and those are the different recession. So I have to be careful about any specific predictions. But we had some challenges, I think coming out of the pandemic with the price that we're selling in the PEO were slightly smaller and just ballpark it around 10% smaller. So let's say that the average, I'm just going to make up the numbers. Let's say the average new clients over in the PEO with 3 worksite employees and all of a sudden, prior to the pandemic and that's been can quote, growing slightly over the years.  All of a sudden it came down to like 27, so 10% decline. So even if you sell 10% more units, if the units are at 10% smaller, you basically end up in the same place. So that's a little bit of what we were expecting. We believe that a 100% related to the economy, and to what was happening with the pandemic. Now what we've seen in the recovery is both the unit growth is still strong as it was prior year, and now our unit size has recovered. And so the combination of those 2 things has created really, really strong growth in the first quarter in the PEO.  The only caveat that I would add also is that we did have a transition into a new year, as you know, our fiscal year ended on June 30th. And in some cases, our businesses tend to perform really extremely well in the first quarter when they come out of a year where -- I wouldn't call it under-performance because it was still a good year last year, given the circumstances. But clearly the PEO, we were very, I think, clear that the PEO had been trailing, in terms of recovery when it comes to bookings, what we were seeing in EF. Now, as we expected, the horse race now -- the horse in the lead has changed. So now the PEO is the one leading the race.\nTien Jian Huang: Thank you, Carlos.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thank you and congrats on the results and Don Welcome. Hey, I wondered -- could you give us a sense, Carlos, from a sales perspective, despite the tight environment you're still delivering, is there any way to think about the go-to-market strategy this cycle as opposed to last that and how maybe technology and maybe more of a mix down-market helps drive that process. I guess what I'm saying is there more leverage in the sales force today than you've ever had, is there any way to maybe put some parameters around that?\nCarlos Rodriguez : I think there is definitely more leverage in the sales force than we've ever had because -- I mean, I think maybe what you're alluding to our sales force like a lot of other of our competitors had to go to a 100% virtual for a number of months, and I'm sure every competitor handled differently in terms of how long they were virtual, versus when they went back in the field. But that process which we had been learning about for 20-25 years, like we have almost a third of our sales force already selling what we call insights sales. And so they were able to sell virtually. They had been in a building, but it didn't really matter whether they want the building or in their homes. They were still able to sell very effectively. That was an easy transition for that portion of our sales force, and then we really with the appropriate tools and some training and some learning from our inside sales force we really moved our entire sales force to sell virtually. So I think now we're really in a period where we're going to sell based on, however the client wants to be sold. And so if the client wants a combination of an initial video call on Zoom or WebEx, we'll do that.  If the client once an in-person visits we'll do that if they want to close the deal with an in-person, but start with a video, we can do that. So I think there's no question that if Salesforce leverage has increased for us, but admittedly, probably for our competitors as well. Our reach has definitely been extended. There's no question about that in terms of tools, but also philosophically. I think we are now, I think able to sell in a, I mean to use a cliche and omnichannel way.  We're also investing heavily in digital marketing. So you mentioned the down-market, I would just add that because of some of the comparisons to the down-market had that was not withdraw the sales results this quarter. It was actually all the other businesses. So but we do see the underlying strength in small business. But because of the difficult comparison, it's not reflected in the percentages. So not trying to minimize the strength in the momentum in the down-market, I'm trying to emphasize the strength everywhere else in the portfolio. And the rest of the portfolio also can benefit from digital tools, digital marketing, but it's not quite as leveraged as it is in the down market. So I think it's a combination of a lot of different things, but the overall, I think comment would be there's no question that there is increased leverage in the Salesforce and you're seeing it in terms of the productivity numbers. I mean it, we are frankly very positively surprised by the rebound in what we call average sales force productivity. So the actual sales rep level, how much are they selling today versus what were they selling in Fiscal year '19. And that is back to, and above that level, which is very pleasing to us.\nKevin McVeigh: That's helpful. And then just one real quick one on retention. What was the boost kind of all the Q1 over-performance because I know the Q2 December's big quarter in terms of retention, things like that or is it just more optimism over the balance of the year or a little of both? Is there any way to frame how much of that boost was maybe Q1 over-performance as opposed to how you're feeling over the balance of the year?\nDon Mcguire : Maybe I will take that. I think our retention, certainly we're very happy with the Q1 record we have, but I think it's also heavily linked to the success we've had over the last few years with our improvements in NPS. And as our NPS continues to go on the right direction and improved, we're seeing general increases in retention to go along with that, I think that's what we would expect and that's what we want to see happen.  So I think there is some relationship there. The -- with no doubt that the retention is very good and we're benefiting still I think from a little bit of some of the concerns coming out of the pandemic that clients may have about switching it during a time of still virtual for many. So we're benefiting from that as well and we acknowledge that. But as I said, we're very happy with the retention and the progress we're making with our products and our service that go along to driving those retention numbers. We will see a little bit of a step back perhaps in the down-market. But as we said so far, it's soft living up better than we expected.\nDanyal Hussain: And just to clarify, because we did share in our prepared remarks that the raise which primarily a function of the Q1 results, obviously we have the stability in October as well.\nKevin McVeigh: That makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El Assal : Hi, Gentlemen. Thanks for taking my call this morning. I wanted to ask about margins and forgive me if you addressed this in some detail, I missed a bit of the call earlier, but it came in really strongest quarter well above our model, can you speak to the drivers of the beat and also to their sustainability as we move forward.\nCarlos Rodriguez : Sure, let me start by saying that the margin in the first quarter was a record for us. And it was above last year as we just reported But if you go back to last year -- last year was above the prior year. It's quite impressive that we had margin improvement last year, given that we were one quarter into a pandemic. But it's even more impressive is that impressive that we had margin improvement again, having said that, up the victory lap.  Then the other part of the comment is we had way higher revenue than we had anticipated, which is incredibly gratifying We're very happy about that, and it was really in both ES and PEO. And it was an a bunch of different places. Slightly better pace per control, retention was better. You heard all the comments. We have just a lot of things working in our favor here. The expenses have not caught up to the revenues and so right now, we are trying to add capacity, both for implementation and service, particularly ahead of our year-end period.  And so like other companies, the most important thing for us is to be able to execute on our commitments to our clients, and to be able to start a business that we've sold. And so I would say that that's a dynamic that factored into the margin performance, but I don't want to take anything away from the organization or anything away from the operating leverage because it's pretty impressive what the organization was able to accomplish. But had we known where we were going to be in terms of top line and volumes, we would have more headcount today than we have. And there is some catching up to do.  Now to put a fine point on that, don't think of, we have to add hundreds of millions dollars with expense, we're just a little bit behind, and that's why you see in case someone's asked it yet may as well address it head on for the rest of the year. When you look at the EPS and the guidance, we really not raising by much more than what we had in terms of our performance in Q1. And that's because we are going to continue to invest in both sales and distribution, but also in service and implementation.  And that delay in hiring or deferred hiring helped us in terms of the margin in the first quarter, I strongly believe we still would've had a very strong margin performance in the first quarter, even had we hit our headcount numbers for service implementation and volume-related businesses. And I thought I should kind of put that out there because it seems like an obvious question as well.\nRamsey El Assal : That's great and I appreciate your candor there. Quick follow-up from me. I was wondering about the human resources and human capital management products. Can you talk about how the cross-selling process into your basic kit of kind of payroll customers is organized? I'm just trying to figure out sort of how you go about that cross-sell process. And I guess how much of a runway do you see for attach rates to those products?\nCarlos Rodriguez : There really isn't a simple answer to that, to the first part. We'll come back to the -- I think the second question about the attach rates. Let me answer that one first. The attach rates are -- there's a couple of products where we have what I would call good attach rates, acceptable, which is saying as CEO speak for, they could always be higher. Like our benefit admin tools, our time and attendance systems. But most of our products and our worker's compensation tool in a down-market also has a high attach rate. But almost everything else that is quote, unquote, beyond payroll. So HCM in addition to kind of our core payroll solutions, we're way under penetrated in terms of attach rates.  So there is a lot of potential, I think for that to improve as well. So on the first part of your question in terms of how we cross-sell, as I started saying, there isn't a simple answer because there isn't a simple answer. In some of our businesses, we have very distinct organizations like in the down-market, we have a large down-market sales force that works with accountants and other kind of third-party channels and also sell directly. And then we have a sales force that sells our retirement solutions are 401K products.  And our insurance services solution, those are distinct sales forces that basically share leaves with each other, and they have incentives to do so. That down-market business also feeds business to our PEO through also incentives. But there is a separate and distinct sales force in the PEO as well. When you get into the up-market and into the mid-market, you start to get some portion of our sales force which is able to sell multiple products or whatever call bundles.  But even then, you still have specialized sales forces in certain circumstances, depending on, I think the specialization or the complexity of the product. But in all cases, we have primary sales. What I would call primary sales people. So the quarterback, if you will, on an account. Now I'm talking about upmarket and mid-market and those quarterbacks are really in charge of making sure that when it's appropriate, and when a client has a need that we bring in our specialized sales people that have specific knowledge about some of our other HCM solutions.  So I wish I could give you a simple answer, but that's actually part of the secret sauce, right? In terms of our ability to grow and outperform some of our competitors is to be able to do that well. And I'd like to say that I invented this, but this is something that goes all the way back to the Frank Wattenberg days and to my predecessors . And this is a well - oiled machine in terms of our sales and distribution. And specifically, you've just described about the cross-sell. And again, to put a fine point on it roughly 50 percent of our bookings come from cross-sell and roughly 50 percent of our bookings come from new logos each year.\nRamsey El Assal : Very helpful. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKartik Mehta: Carlos, I just wanted to get your thoughts. I know you talk to obviously a lot about new sales and I'm wondering, outside of this wage inflation that you're seeing. Is the cost to acquire clients going down, especially on the SMB side now that there is a new way to sell to them? Or do you think the cost to acquire clients as we move through this pandemic will go back to what it was?\nCarlos Rodriguez : I wish I had a crystal ball in terms of answering where it's going to go. But I think just from a mathematical or technical standpoint, the cost of sale is definitely pulling down because of this productivity increase. So this is the same leverage that you're seeing in so many industries and so many businesses, including ours, on the revenue happens on the bookings as well. When you get higher volumes it basically indicates higher -- unless you add a lot of expense, by definition you get higher productivity.  So you see us being reported in the press all the time about, how worker productivity is up. Well, hardly reason why worker productivity is up is because revenues of recovered, volumes have recovered, and it sustained people. Or you're adding a few more people now. Maybe people aren't focusing on, is that worker productivity went down, right as the pandemic kind of set in and people's revenues went down. So I hate to make it so simplistic, mathematically. But some of that is what's happening now.  So you do have to be careful about jumping to any medium to long-term conclusions because right now our cost of sale compared to last year and the year before is definitely coming down as a result of a very large increase in bookings with how a similar increase in expenses. We still though are not back to where our cost of sale was pre -pandemic. And we hope to get there. But that will require even a little bit more productivity during this year.  But that would be our expectation is that whether it's the GDP or interest rates or employment, that, there's regression to the mean here as they very large economy. ADP's large Company, but the economy is massive, and it tends to regress to the mean on a lot of things, and we also tend to regress to the mean s. So I think some of these things will work themselves out. And you have to just get past the base effects, and the comparisons, and so forth to really understand where you are, and we won't know that until we're on the other side unfortunately, I hate to say it.\nKartik Mehta: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Thank you very much and thanks for all the  this morning. I guess maybe I just want to ask the obvious headline question and just wondering how the reported current tightness in the labor market, as factored into your guidance? And how are you anticipating on that changes through the coming fiscal year? And I guess maybe a product and service-related question tied to that. Are you seeing incremental sales opportunities with some of the tech that you can provide to your clients for hiring, etc. and is that having any impact on how you're thinking about your outlook and forecasts? Thanks.\nCarlos Rodriguez : Thanks for the question. The second part of your question, I think kind of answers the first part. The answer is yes. Like, I think part -- again, hard to separate how much is just pure GDP growth, new business formation etc. But the last part of your question, there's no question that part of our growth is driven by what you are alluding to, which is everyone now is looking for help in terms of hiring, attracting people, and frankly, also trying to hold onto them. This is a great environment for us. The combination of strong GDP, an administration that is more inclined towards regulation, and then a tight labor market for people who do the things that we do. By that I mean, payroll staff and HR staff at prospects and our clients.  That's all a very good backdrop for us. I'm assuming that -- this is not going to resolve itself overnight in terms of the tightness in the labor market. We should anticipate some tailwinds here and some help for some period of time, until that changes. And I hate to use the R word, but some day, at some point in the future, doesn't see m anywhere near future given what's going on with government stimulus and government policy. But someday that might change. But we don't see that on the horizon right now. On the very first part of your question though in terms of the tight labor markets, I would say the overwhelming impact of tight labor markets is positive on AEP. I mentioned one of the challenges we have, which is tight labor market affects our own internal associates in terms of we have to hire service people and implementation people, so it's harder for us like it is harder for anyone else. But that pale in comparison to the upside, like a tight labor market drive new bookings as we just talked about in the last part of your question. But it also could create inflationary pressures, which drives our balanced growth. It should drive interest rates higher, which is one of the most underappreciated stories, I think of ADP is the potential upside in our flow business.  And the reason it's underestimated because it's done nothing for 10 years because they've been here for 10 years and has been nothing for pain and headwind. And just what I thought we were coming out of it, we go into a pandemic, and we get more pain, and race go even lower than they were before. But I'm pretty sure that it those changes any lower now. Although, I think we may have to file an AK after saying that. I'm making a statement on interest rates. But, whatever. Hover around here, go down a little bit there, but it feels pretty certain that the long-term, medium and long-term trend now for interest rates will be at least for gradual increases.  And I'm not suggesting that there's still underlying demographics that may keep us from getting back to the same kind of 10-year rate that we had 15 years ago or ten years ago. But I think everyone knows when you look at real interest rates that there is upside on interest rate. So the tight labor market helps in a number of ways. It creates activity for our sales force. Every time there's activity and there's conversations, we're going to win our fair share. So that's a great backdrop.  It creates opportunities for our balances. I think it creates opportunities for the PEO because some of our billings are actually driven by as a percentage of wages. And whenever you have wage inflation, if you are building on percent of wages, to some extent that will help, that's not So, like an infinite thing because we won't just allow our revenue to go up indefinitely. We'd have to adjust those rates but in the medium-term, we will see, I think, some tailwind from -- in the PEO from higher wages and wage growth, which is inevitable outcome of a tight labor market.\nJames Faucette: That's great color. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I had to follow-up first on retention. Curious, within the record, 1Q retention performance, can you dig in a little bit more as far as the drivers there between the still lower out of business closures versus essentially better competitive win rates, And anything broadly, you can comment on around -- around clients switching behavior or client re engagement to assess HCM solutions?\nCarlos Rodriguez : On the first -- on the first part, I'm not sure how much more color we can give you. We have a fair amount of detail in terms of losses and retention around, we call non-controlled the losses which are broadly speaking out of business, bankruptcies, etc. And those have started to trend back up again. They're not back to normal levels, but they started to trend back. I think that's not surprising because there's still a lot of liquidity, and a lot of stimulus if you will, even if it's not new stimulus. So when you have consumer spending doing what it's doing, and you have activity doing what it's doing. It tends to be supportive of small business rather than the normal turnover that you have that's natural in the small business sector.  I guess with hindsight, like if 3 or 6 months ago, when we were putting together our plan, we'd had a crystal ball, we would've probably -- and we had experienced with the pandemic, we probably would have planned the downturn in retention to be slower. So we've been positively surprised by how long it's taking for those losses to regress back to normal. Having said that, we don't know that they're going to regress 100 % backs  because there's other parts of our retention that are controllable. We call controllable. In our controllable losses, we see those going down as well.  And I think Don made a common thing that should not be lost on you, which is that our client satisfaction scores as measured by NPS, are the highest they've ever been. And I give credit to the organization for during the pandemic, being able to get through what was an incredibly difficult time for them personally, in terms of they were trying to help our clients. But we also had a huge increase in volume because of all the government stimulus programs in the PPP loans, etc. And this happened all over the world, it wasn't just in the U.S.. And fortunately, we maintained relative stability in our headcount.  We didn't do mass layoffs and let a bunch of people go. So the combination of maintaining investment and also being able to, to have people -- I don't know how to described it. Make a efforts to help our clients, we were able to maintain those NPS where that actually haven't go up. And there's staying at very strong levels, and we believe that there is a correlation between strong NPS and retention. So we may be able to see new record highs for retention on a permanent basis, but it's way too early to make that prediction.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. And then just follow-up on, on next-gen HCM platform. Can you provide an update on new sales there? Maybe the pipeline and sold clients versus lifelines, any metrics or updates you're willing to share?\nCarlos Rodriguez : Sure. I think we talked about over the last couple of quarters as we kind of entered in the pandemic, we obviously had a couple of particularly large clients that we're in industries that were particularly hard hit. So we've got put on a little bit off course, if you will, in terms of our implementations and our starts. We also, I think, started to focus on implementation tools. I think we had -- I don't know how many set -- how many we said we had sold. And as we started implementing in starting these clients. We recognize that we still have some work to do in terms of implementation tools and making sure that if and when we want to use third-party integrators to help us with that, that we need to build out those tools.  There has been quite a lot of focus on that effort. And we feel good about it. We actually -- I think we also talked about investments in the last quarter that we made to bring in some third-parties to help us with the evaluation. And in some cases, the build of that to make sure that as we now enter a hopefully a period of time where we can really accelerate the implementations and the growth and the starts of those clients.  But it's fair to say, and I think we said in the last couple of quarters that our focused turn ed more to, making sure that we have a strong foundation and that we had the right implementation tools to be able to get the business started that we intend to have in the next year or 2, which is hopefully quite -- quite a lot of business. And you'll hear more details about this when we get to our Investor Day on November 15th.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with Moffett Nathanson. Your line is open.\nEugene Simuni: Hi, thank you very much for taking my questions. I have badge the couple in the PEO, so I'm asking upfront. One is that, if you look broadly at your HRO offerings, so PEO and non-PEO, can you compare and contrast for us a little bit to the PEO Solutions and non-PEO hopefully outsourced solutions, how are you seeing them growing relative to each other the demand? And are you seeing any switch in between clients who might be using that HRO Solutions without benefits switching into the PEO? So that will be the first one and the second, I was just curious. How are you positioning the be-all franchise to really win market share in a post-pandemic environment, given the secular growth seems to be very favorable. But how do you actually make sure that ADP wins share?\nCarlos Rodriguez : So on the first -- on the first question, I think I said in my early comments that all of the HRO Solutions, the Corporal Outsourcing Solutions, are very, very strong across-the-board, right? Up-market because we have HRO Solutions in the up-market, we have in the mid-market, and we have them in the down-market. And in in the down market -- and in the mid-market, we have PEO, but we also have what you're alluding to, which is a non-core employment. What I would call -- we call it comprehensive services, as the name implies, it provides a kind of broader assortment of services in addition to our traditional software in our traditional tax and other services.  There is to my knowledge a lot of switching from clients that are, what I would call typical clients of ADP that have payroll benefits and I'd then maybe TLM, etc., whether it's in a down-market in the mid-market into these HRO Solutions, there is not a lot to my knowledge of switching across because it typically. Again, if we're doing our job from a sales standpoint, you are really trying to find the right fit for the client. In some cases, the client wants you to do their benefits admin, and provide their benefits, provide the workers comp, and their 401-K.  In other cases, the client wants you to only do the administrative back-office of the payroll department in the HR department which would be the non - PEO solutions. So I think if we do our job well, which I think we do in the sales process, and in the upgrade process, those clients tend to stay on those -- on whatever solution they have chosen. But to be clear, both of them are growing at this point at rates that are multiples of our growth in employer services. And so it's quite impressive in terms of the tailwind and the growth rates that we have in all of the HRO businesses.  On the last part of your question, which I think was about positioning PEO in terms of market share and so forth. We have 600 and I think it's 630,000 roughly, we reported worksite employees, average worksite employees this last quarter. That's tripled, what it was 10 years ago in the first quarter of fiscal year 11. And so and that's a higher market share than it was 10 years ago. So I don't know how else to answer that question other than to say that we have a proven track record of execution to continue to drive growth in the PEO that's faster than the markets. So I don't think there's any question about our positioning or our ability to drive market share as evidenced by our ability to execute.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Good morning, Carlos and Don, look forward to working with you. On next-gen payroll can you give us an update in terms of the roll out there, please?\nCarlos Rodriguez : So next-gen PEO, equally excited as we are about next-gen HCM in terms of what this holds for the future for ADP. The challenge for us in terms of as we communicate and on November 15th, we'll try to figure out a way to address this issue. Like, we have 15 billion in revenue. So as well as next-gen HCM are going and next-gen payroll is going, it just doesn't -- this is a future impact for ADP., so it's not in the next quarter. And I know you're not asking a question that's really about next quarter mark, but I think it was a good opportunity to kind of throw that out there.  That -- what's driving the performance of ADP this quarter, this year, and for the next 2 to 3 years is not going to be that from a financial standpoint. But in terms of positioning the Company for the future, in terms of growth and creating competitive differentiation and the ability to drive new bookings, they're absolutely critical. So I would say that on those measurements we're still happy and excited by the progress we're seeing with both next-gen HCM, as well as next-gen payroll, we have not gone to general availability, so we're selling a lot of next-gen payroll, but we're only selling in what we call the core of major accounts right now of the mid-market, which is kind of 50 to 150 and this is no different in terms of the playbook that we use with our transition from our old platform to run in a down-market.  And some of our more legacy platform in mid-market to then our next-gen Workforce Now version which we're on now. So we're doing the same thing with next-gen payroll and the same thing with next-gen HCM, which is we're doing very carefully that we have a very large installed base. And we are not -- We're going to eventually move some of those clients, and begin to move some of those clients. But we're happy with the business and the cash flow that we have, and the clients satisfaction scores that are record levels on our existing platform.  So we do not have any -- this is not panicking. There's no sense of crisis, and there's no -- we have urgency, but no crisis, because I want to make sure people hear that. Like, I don't want you to think that we all have a sense of urgency because the faster we get these two solutions to scale, the faster we beat the competition.\nMark Marcon: I appreciate that, and thanks for the color there. On the PEO growth, can you talk a little bit about two different dimensions? 1 would be, the growth that you're seeing kind of in the established states relative to some of the less mature states and to what extent are you seeing less mature states really catch on? Particularly given the -- the legislative and regulatory backdrop. And then secondly, how should we think about just health insurance costs now that elective surgeries are starting to come back, elective procedures are starting to come back. What impact would that end up having just on the overall pricing? I know that you're not necessarily impacted directly from a margin perspective, but just thinking about the demand environment.\nCarlos Rodriguez : It's a great question. I think the second part of question, so hopefully you'll forget about first part because we don't have -- we try to prepare for everything and that one, we'll have to follow-up with you on in terms of what regions or what states, we're strongest in terms of our sales. I'm going to suspect that they were all strong because honestly, like the PEO results were off the charts, there can't be any state that wasn't in strong double-digit growth. But we'll follow up on that question. On the healthcare rate question, you're right that we're not directly impacted, but you're also right to imply that we're indirectly impacted because it does matter, right? It matters to our clients what they're paying for healthcare.  And I hate to be so simplistic, but I think what the actual regression to the mean and large economies -- the healthcare world and insurance companies are also similar in terms of they regress, right? So losses have an uncanny way of regressing to the mean. That's why I always caution people when all of a sudden someone thinks that they have this big decline in either workers comp costs or healthcare costs. It usually doesn't work that way. There's usually something that explains it and it usually regresses back to the mean.  I think, if I can try to answer -- what I think is the implication of your question, there was a temporary decline in things like elective surgery, and frankly, healthcare in general. People even start to stop going to their primary care physicians and so forth, that decreased healthcare costs temporarily. And I hate to use that word transitory, that is now the favorite word it seems talk about inflation, but it's very clear that that was transitory and that healthcare costs will come back.  And so I think to the extent you had below normal renewals, which would be our situation because we don't take risk on healthcare, so we wouldn't see it in our margins and in our cost structure. But to the extent that we had below normal renewals, we would expect those renewals to go back to normal because we would expect as healthcare costs go back to normal slowly, that those costs would have to be pass-through.  When you look at the healthcare insurance companies, as much criticism as they get, they are largely pass-through entities. They're paying hospitals, and providers, and other healthcare costs, prescription drugs, etc. And it's really not a business where you can say, we can't pass this 10 percent increase in healthcare costs because their margins are even 10 percent. And so that business is very straightforward, which is they try to earn a markup or margin for doing what they do in terms of managing networks etc. But in the end, they have to pass those costs through. We have to also, because we're a passive entity as well. And I think those who take risk on healthcare will probably see those costs go up over some period of time.\nMark Marcon: Appreciate the comments. Look forward to seeing you on the 15th.\nCarlos Rodriguez : Same here.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.\nCarlos Rodriguez : There's not much more I can say as we really had terrific results. I want to thank Don for joining and I think you're all going to be very happy to meet him and get the benefit of his experience in ADP more broadly, besides just in the finance organization. Because he has kind of real-world business experience within ADP as well. The -- I just want to end the way I usually end which is thanking our organization and particularly our front line associates because I'm not sure what's going on in other companies. but we would not be able to get our goals accomplished without people going above and beyond.  I think we mentioned the tight labor market and that we're a little bit behind in terms of our hiring, that means our people are working extra hard. An economist said, that an increase in productivity, I'd say that's just people working hard. And we really appreciate it, our clients appreciate it. I think our shareholders appreciate it, and I don't think a lot listen to this call, but you should be aware of that, whether it's here in other companies, there's a lot of people out there that are pushing really hard to deliver.  And many of us, whether we're as consumers or buyers of products and businesses and so we're frustrated by what's happening in terms of supply chain and some of these other things. But all I see is a bunch of people working really, really hard to try to fulfill the needs of our clients. And I think that's happening across the whole economy. And I think we'd show a little bit of patience with each other.  Because this will all normalize as these variant now recedes, I mean, you're seeing already and some of the mobility data, things will slowly get back to normal. People will come back into the labor force. And this great economy that we have will function, the way it's supposed to function. But in the meantime, I want to thank our associates for what they've done so far, whether it's this last quarter and what they're going to have to do to get through this year-end, which is going to be very challenging given the volumes we have and the capacity we have. So for that, I thank them, but I also thank all of you for listening and for being supporters of ADP. Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Carlos Rodriguez",
            "content": "Now, moving on to the quarter. We're pleased to have delivered a very strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth and 140 basis points of margin expansion, resulting in 17% increase in adjusted diluted EPS. While we did expect our Q1 revenue growth to be above our prior full-year guidance range, this result was still above our initial forecast and underscores the strong position, we are in as we emerge from the pandemic. I'll let Don go through the details after I cover some highlights. Our ES new business bookings results for very strong, representing another record Q1 bookings amount. And we're ahead of our expectations, but our performance driven by continued strength in our HR portfolio, in our international business. With this impressive bookings performance across the enterprise, we're pleased to raise our ES bookings guidance for the year after just one quarter, as we're now feeling even more confident about our sales momentum. Even stronger was our CEO bookings performance, which was also well ahead of our expectations.  And a key reason that we are raising our guidance for average worksite employee growth for the year, as Don will outline for you. As you will recall, we have been sharing our sales productivity trends over the course of the pandemic and I'm pleased to report that in Q1 we were well above pre -pandemic levels. We reached this result several months sooner than we expected, and we expect us to continue as we look ahead. Our ES retention remained incredibly strong as well. As we shared last quarter, we believed it was reasonable to assume a slight step back and retention from the record 92.2% level we experienced last year.  But in Q1, we did not see meaningful deterioration. Instead, we actually saw further improvement in our overall ES retention to a new record Q1 level, despite amongst decline in our small business division, where out of business losses started to trend back to more normal levels compared to the below normal levels last year. We're continuing to assume a slight decline in our retention outlook for the year. But clearly, we are pleased with our performance so far in the upward revision in our retention outlook reflect the strong Q1 performance. Our ESP pays per control was solid with 7% growth in the quarter, about in line with our expectations. We feel that a number of questions these pass over months about what we think might drive workers back until the labor force.  While we don't have an answer to that question, what we can tell you is that we continue to see positive trends. Our clients are eager to hire and we are seeing workers returned to the labor force, even if it's gradual. As a result, we expect to benefit from above-normal and above-normal level of pays per control growth over the course of the year. In addition to the very strong ES performance, our PEO delivered another stellar quarter with 15% revenue growth and 15% average worksite - employee growth.  Even better than the high expectations we had coming into the quarter. There were multiple drivers to the outlook performance in the PEO, including the strong level of hiring within the client base, resilient retention, and the improved bookings performance I mentioned earlier. We're very pleased with the momentum we see building in the PEO. And we're raising our full-year guidance accordingly. In addition to the financial highlights, there are a few product highlights I wanted to share with you. First, I'm excited to share that we completed the initial roll out of our new user experience for RUN.  As we shared with you last quarter, this represents the most comprehensive refresh we've done since the launch of RUN. And we're very proud that in a matter of a quarter, we were able to seamlessly move hundreds of thousands of clients to a new and better user experience. Early signs indicate the client satisfaction scores to trend even higher than the record levels we already have in our small business division. So it's a really great outcome and represents a very strong execution by the team. I'd like to also share that at the Annual HR Tech Conference a few weeks ago, our innovative diversity, equity and inclusion tool on a DataCloud platform was named a top HR product.  This recognition adds to ADP's longstanding history of award wins at the conference, marking an unprecedented seven consecutive year ADP has been honored for its innovative HCM Technology. You can probably talk from the number of times we've highlighted DataCloud that our velocity of innovation has increased significantly there. With this  solution as an example, we've seen over 50% of active users of the solution take action and realized positive impact on their  measures.  I'm proud that we provide solutions that drive real positive change for our clients. The 7 year track record demonstrates that innovation is part of ADP's DNA. And then we have a strong growing agile R&D team committed to delivering solutions in the market that continue to push the boundary of what HCM solutions can do for employers and employees. As I said before, we're very pleased with a fantastic start to the year. We look forward to sharing even more of the ADP story with you at the upcoming Investor Day in November. And now I will turn the call over to Dan for more detail on the quarter and the outlook. So we -- even though what we really talked about is ES bookings, just want to start by saying that the PEO Bookings were incredibly strong. I don't know how else to put it. So I call it orders of magnitude in terms of growth rate higher than even the ES bookings growth for the quarter. That was really good to see.  So that's kind of a sign to your question about products that I think the market is really searching for solutions coming out of this pandemic, that helped them with obviously people issues and sort of, but there's also a talent for -- so people are looking to obviously attract and retain people in this environment where every Company, including ADP, is going through some of these challenged in terms of retracting our own internal talent.  And then you have another dynamic which is, if there are shortages of labor in various categories there we're hearing that there's also shortages of talent in kind of HCM category in general that should create a little bit of an advantage for the clinical outsourcers, right? So as you know, our model is, we provide great technology and software, but we also do the back-office work and we take accountability for outcomes. And I think when people are struggling to hire people to do the work in their HR department, or their payroll department, or their benefits department, we're here to help.  And so I think those outsourcing solutions are getting a lot of tailwind. We also saw because of the easy comps and I think you've heard it in Dan 's comments. Some of the things like our recruitment process outsourcing business and our screening and selection business, which we're really at very low booking levels last year at the same time, have rebounded off for obvious reasons, incredibly well.  But having said that, it was really across the board. We had very strong growth in workforce. Now, we had very strong growth in the up-market. We had strong growth even in a down-market. Although last at the same time, I think we mentioned that we had when we call client-base acquisition which is not technically M&A deal, but we were able to buy and large book of business that we converted, that really some of that flowed through our bookings. So I'd made that comparison a little harder on the SBS side, but if you back that out, it was equally strong on the SBS side as well. I would say that could give you a little bit of color, but it really was across the board.  It just shows how connected we are to the economy and GDP when it comes to bookings, which is something that we've had the theory here for some -- for some years now, and we just have a very strong recovery in a very strong economy. And it's a great environment for our sales force. I think in this kind of environment, given the very first comments we made about the economy, and you have both the economy of the tailwind and you have now in the U.S. I think an administration that is kind of more inclined to regulation into, particularly employer regulation. And so you have, I think a very strong backdrop for what I would say is the foreseeable future. In that environment, historically, what ADP would do is we would add as much sales capacity as possible.  That doesn't mean that we indiscriminately hire because we have people to hire and onboard and train and so forth. And we have to make those people effective. But I would say that we have a strong appetite for growing our sales force, but also for growing our investment in marketing. Whether it's digital marketing or more traditional advertising. And that's exactly what we plan to do. Having said that, I would tell you that we've had challenges like everyone else, in terms of hiring, it's a very difficult labor market.  So I hope that we can fulfill those expectations, those dreams, if you will, of growing our sales force as fast as possible. But that's the only thing that I could see getting in the way. We obviously have the capital, we have the I think the desire and we have, I think the experience to be able to execute once we hire those people to get the sales, get the clients implemented, and then hopefully derive the benefits of that revenue for, in many cases 15-20 years, depending on which business unit you're in. And so I guess I would say strong appetite for both headcount growth, but also other investments in sales. Whether it's marketing, digital marketing, sales tools, all across-the-board. So the risk of -- because we had a strong feeling that the PEO business was going to be strong coming out of the pandemic. Because it's been strong coming out of prior economical recession. and those are the different recession. So I have to be careful about any specific predictions. But we had some challenges, I think coming out of the pandemic with the price that we're selling in the PEO were slightly smaller and just ballpark it around 10% smaller. So let's say that the average, I'm just going to make up the numbers. Let's say the average new clients over in the PEO with 3 worksite employees and all of a sudden, prior to the pandemic and that's been can quote, growing slightly over the years.  All of a sudden it came down to like 27, so 10% decline. So even if you sell 10% more units, if the units are at 10% smaller, you basically end up in the same place. So that's a little bit of what we were expecting. We believe that a 100% related to the economy, and to what was happening with the pandemic. Now what we've seen in the recovery is both the unit growth is still strong as it was prior year, and now our unit size has recovered. And so the combination of those 2 things has created really, really strong growth in the first quarter in the PEO.  The only caveat that I would add also is that we did have a transition into a new year, as you know, our fiscal year ended on June 30th. And in some cases, our businesses tend to perform really extremely well in the first quarter when they come out of a year where -- I wouldn't call it under-performance because it was still a good year last year, given the circumstances. But clearly the PEO, we were very, I think, clear that the PEO had been trailing, in terms of recovery when it comes to bookings, what we were seeing in EF. Now, as we expected, the horse race now -- the horse in the lead has changed. So now the PEO is the one leading the race. I think there is definitely more leverage in the sales force than we've ever had because -- I mean, I think maybe what you're alluding to our sales force like a lot of other of our competitors had to go to a 100% virtual for a number of months, and I'm sure every competitor handled differently in terms of how long they were virtual, versus when they went back in the field. But that process which we had been learning about for 20-25 years, like we have almost a third of our sales force already selling what we call insights sales. And so they were able to sell virtually. They had been in a building, but it didn't really matter whether they want the building or in their homes. They were still able to sell very effectively. That was an easy transition for that portion of our sales force, and then we really with the appropriate tools and some training and some learning from our inside sales force we really moved our entire sales force to sell virtually. So I think now we're really in a period where we're going to sell based on, however the client wants to be sold. And so if the client wants a combination of an initial video call on Zoom or WebEx, we'll do that.  If the client once an in-person visits we'll do that if they want to close the deal with an in-person, but start with a video, we can do that. So I think there's no question that if Salesforce leverage has increased for us, but admittedly, probably for our competitors as well. Our reach has definitely been extended. There's no question about that in terms of tools, but also philosophically. I think we are now, I think able to sell in a, I mean to use a cliche and omnichannel way.  We're also investing heavily in digital marketing. So you mentioned the down-market, I would just add that because of some of the comparisons to the down-market had that was not withdraw the sales results this quarter. It was actually all the other businesses. So but we do see the underlying strength in small business. But because of the difficult comparison, it's not reflected in the percentages. So not trying to minimize the strength in the momentum in the down-market, I'm trying to emphasize the strength everywhere else in the portfolio. And the rest of the portfolio also can benefit from digital tools, digital marketing, but it's not quite as leveraged as it is in the down market. So I think it's a combination of a lot of different things, but the overall, I think comment would be there's no question that there is increased leverage in the Salesforce and you're seeing it in terms of the productivity numbers. I mean it, we are frankly very positively surprised by the rebound in what we call average sales force productivity. So the actual sales rep level, how much are they selling today versus what were they selling in Fiscal year '19. And that is back to, and above that level, which is very pleasing to us. Sure, let me start by saying that the margin in the first quarter was a record for us. And it was above last year as we just reported But if you go back to last year -- last year was above the prior year. It's quite impressive that we had margin improvement last year, given that we were one quarter into a pandemic. But it's even more impressive is that impressive that we had margin improvement again, having said that, up the victory lap.  Then the other part of the comment is we had way higher revenue than we had anticipated, which is incredibly gratifying We're very happy about that, and it was really in both ES and PEO. And it was an a bunch of different places. Slightly better pace per control, retention was better. You heard all the comments. We have just a lot of things working in our favor here. The expenses have not caught up to the revenues and so right now, we are trying to add capacity, both for implementation and service, particularly ahead of our year-end period.  And so like other companies, the most important thing for us is to be able to execute on our commitments to our clients, and to be able to start a business that we've sold. And so I would say that that's a dynamic that factored into the margin performance, but I don't want to take anything away from the organization or anything away from the operating leverage because it's pretty impressive what the organization was able to accomplish. But had we known where we were going to be in terms of top line and volumes, we would have more headcount today than we have. And there is some catching up to do.  Now to put a fine point on that, don't think of, we have to add hundreds of millions dollars with expense, we're just a little bit behind, and that's why you see in case someone's asked it yet may as well address it head on for the rest of the year. When you look at the EPS and the guidance, we really not raising by much more than what we had in terms of our performance in Q1. And that's because we are going to continue to invest in both sales and distribution, but also in service and implementation.  And that delay in hiring or deferred hiring helped us in terms of the margin in the first quarter, I strongly believe we still would've had a very strong margin performance in the first quarter, even had we hit our headcount numbers for service implementation and volume-related businesses. And I thought I should kind of put that out there because it seems like an obvious question as well. There really isn't a simple answer to that, to the first part. We'll come back to the -- I think the second question about the attach rates. Let me answer that one first. The attach rates are -- there's a couple of products where we have what I would call good attach rates, acceptable, which is saying as CEO speak for, they could always be higher. Like our benefit admin tools, our time and attendance systems. But most of our products and our worker's compensation tool in a down-market also has a high attach rate. But almost everything else that is quote, unquote, beyond payroll. So HCM in addition to kind of our core payroll solutions, we're way under penetrated in terms of attach rates.  So there is a lot of potential, I think for that to improve as well. So on the first part of your question in terms of how we cross-sell, as I started saying, there isn't a simple answer because there isn't a simple answer. In some of our businesses, we have very distinct organizations like in the down-market, we have a large down-market sales force that works with accountants and other kind of third-party channels and also sell directly. And then we have a sales force that sells our retirement solutions are 401K products.  And our insurance services solution, those are distinct sales forces that basically share leaves with each other, and they have incentives to do so. That down-market business also feeds business to our PEO through also incentives. But there is a separate and distinct sales force in the PEO as well. When you get into the up-market and into the mid-market, you start to get some portion of our sales force which is able to sell multiple products or whatever call bundles.  But even then, you still have specialized sales forces in certain circumstances, depending on, I think the specialization or the complexity of the product. But in all cases, we have primary sales. What I would call primary sales people. So the quarterback, if you will, on an account. Now I'm talking about upmarket and mid-market and those quarterbacks are really in charge of making sure that when it's appropriate, and when a client has a need that we bring in our specialized sales people that have specific knowledge about some of our other HCM solutions.  So I wish I could give you a simple answer, but that's actually part of the secret sauce, right? In terms of our ability to grow and outperform some of our competitors is to be able to do that well. And I'd like to say that I invented this, but this is something that goes all the way back to the Frank Wattenberg days and to my predecessors . And this is a well - oiled machine in terms of our sales and distribution. And specifically, you've just described about the cross-sell. And again, to put a fine point on it roughly 50 percent of our bookings come from cross-sell and roughly 50 percent of our bookings come from new logos each year. I wish I had a crystal ball in terms of answering where it's going to go. But I think just from a mathematical or technical standpoint, the cost of sale is definitely pulling down because of this productivity increase. So this is the same leverage that you're seeing in so many industries and so many businesses, including ours, on the revenue happens on the bookings as well. When you get higher volumes it basically indicates higher -- unless you add a lot of expense, by definition you get higher productivity.  So you see us being reported in the press all the time about, how worker productivity is up. Well, hardly reason why worker productivity is up is because revenues of recovered, volumes have recovered, and it sustained people. Or you're adding a few more people now. Maybe people aren't focusing on, is that worker productivity went down, right as the pandemic kind of set in and people's revenues went down. So I hate to make it so simplistic, mathematically. But some of that is what's happening now.  So you do have to be careful about jumping to any medium to long-term conclusions because right now our cost of sale compared to last year and the year before is definitely coming down as a result of a very large increase in bookings with how a similar increase in expenses. We still though are not back to where our cost of sale was pre -pandemic. And we hope to get there. But that will require even a little bit more productivity during this year.  But that would be our expectation is that whether it's the GDP or interest rates or employment, that, there's regression to the mean here as they very large economy. ADP's large Company, but the economy is massive, and it tends to regress to the mean on a lot of things, and we also tend to regress to the mean s. So I think some of these things will work themselves out. And you have to just get past the base effects, and the comparisons, and so forth to really understand where you are, and we won't know that until we're on the other side unfortunately, I hate to say it. Thanks for the question. The second part of your question, I think kind of answers the first part. The answer is yes. Like, I think part -- again, hard to separate how much is just pure GDP growth, new business formation etc. But the last part of your question, there's no question that part of our growth is driven by what you are alluding to, which is everyone now is looking for help in terms of hiring, attracting people, and frankly, also trying to hold onto them. This is a great environment for us. The combination of strong GDP, an administration that is more inclined towards regulation, and then a tight labor market for people who do the things that we do. By that I mean, payroll staff and HR staff at prospects and our clients.  That's all a very good backdrop for us. I'm assuming that -- this is not going to resolve itself overnight in terms of the tightness in the labor market. We should anticipate some tailwinds here and some help for some period of time, until that changes. And I hate to use the R word, but some day, at some point in the future, doesn't see m anywhere near future given what's going on with government stimulus and government policy. But someday that might change. But we don't see that on the horizon right now. On the very first part of your question though in terms of the tight labor markets, I would say the overwhelming impact of tight labor markets is positive on AEP. I mentioned one of the challenges we have, which is tight labor market affects our own internal associates in terms of we have to hire service people and implementation people, so it's harder for us like it is harder for anyone else. But that pale in comparison to the upside, like a tight labor market drive new bookings as we just talked about in the last part of your question. But it also could create inflationary pressures, which drives our balanced growth. It should drive interest rates higher, which is one of the most underappreciated stories, I think of ADP is the potential upside in our flow business.  And the reason it's underestimated because it's done nothing for 10 years because they've been here for 10 years and has been nothing for pain and headwind. And just what I thought we were coming out of it, we go into a pandemic, and we get more pain, and race go even lower than they were before. But I'm pretty sure that it those changes any lower now. Although, I think we may have to file an AK after saying that. I'm making a statement on interest rates. But, whatever. Hover around here, go down a little bit there, but it feels pretty certain that the long-term, medium and long-term trend now for interest rates will be at least for gradual increases.  And I'm not suggesting that there's still underlying demographics that may keep us from getting back to the same kind of 10-year rate that we had 15 years ago or ten years ago. But I think everyone knows when you look at real interest rates that there is upside on interest rate. So the tight labor market helps in a number of ways. It creates activity for our sales force. Every time there's activity and there's conversations, we're going to win our fair share. So that's a great backdrop.  It creates opportunities for our balances. I think it creates opportunities for the PEO because some of our billings are actually driven by as a percentage of wages. And whenever you have wage inflation, if you are building on percent of wages, to some extent that will help, that's not So, like an infinite thing because we won't just allow our revenue to go up indefinitely. We'd have to adjust those rates but in the medium-term, we will see, I think, some tailwind from -- in the PEO from higher wages and wage growth, which is inevitable outcome of a tight labor market. On the first -- on the first part, I'm not sure how much more color we can give you. We have a fair amount of detail in terms of losses and retention around, we call non-controlled the losses which are broadly speaking out of business, bankruptcies, etc. And those have started to trend back up again. They're not back to normal levels, but they started to trend back. I think that's not surprising because there's still a lot of liquidity, and a lot of stimulus if you will, even if it's not new stimulus. So when you have consumer spending doing what it's doing, and you have activity doing what it's doing. It tends to be supportive of small business rather than the normal turnover that you have that's natural in the small business sector.  I guess with hindsight, like if 3 or 6 months ago, when we were putting together our plan, we'd had a crystal ball, we would've probably -- and we had experienced with the pandemic, we probably would have planned the downturn in retention to be slower. So we've been positively surprised by how long it's taking for those losses to regress back to normal. Having said that, we don't know that they're going to regress 100 % backs  because there's other parts of our retention that are controllable. We call controllable. In our controllable losses, we see those going down as well.  And I think Don made a common thing that should not be lost on you, which is that our client satisfaction scores as measured by NPS, are the highest they've ever been. And I give credit to the organization for during the pandemic, being able to get through what was an incredibly difficult time for them personally, in terms of they were trying to help our clients. But we also had a huge increase in volume because of all the government stimulus programs in the PPP loans, etc. And this happened all over the world, it wasn't just in the U.S.. And fortunately, we maintained relative stability in our headcount.  We didn't do mass layoffs and let a bunch of people go. So the combination of maintaining investment and also being able to, to have people -- I don't know how to described it. Make a efforts to help our clients, we were able to maintain those NPS where that actually haven't go up. And there's staying at very strong levels, and we believe that there is a correlation between strong NPS and retention. So we may be able to see new record highs for retention on a permanent basis, but it's way too early to make that prediction. Sure. I think we talked about over the last couple of quarters as we kind of entered in the pandemic, we obviously had a couple of particularly large clients that we're in industries that were particularly hard hit. So we've got put on a little bit off course, if you will, in terms of our implementations and our starts. We also, I think, started to focus on implementation tools. I think we had -- I don't know how many set -- how many we said we had sold. And as we started implementing in starting these clients. We recognize that we still have some work to do in terms of implementation tools and making sure that if and when we want to use third-party integrators to help us with that, that we need to build out those tools.  There has been quite a lot of focus on that effort. And we feel good about it. We actually -- I think we also talked about investments in the last quarter that we made to bring in some third-parties to help us with the evaluation. And in some cases, the build of that to make sure that as we now enter a hopefully a period of time where we can really accelerate the implementations and the growth and the starts of those clients.  But it's fair to say, and I think we said in the last couple of quarters that our focused turn ed more to, making sure that we have a strong foundation and that we had the right implementation tools to be able to get the business started that we intend to have in the next year or 2, which is hopefully quite -- quite a lot of business. And you'll hear more details about this when we get to our Investor Day on November 15th. So on the first -- on the first question, I think I said in my early comments that all of the HRO Solutions, the Corporal Outsourcing Solutions, are very, very strong across-the-board, right? Up-market because we have HRO Solutions in the up-market, we have in the mid-market, and we have them in the down-market. And in in the down market -- and in the mid-market, we have PEO, but we also have what you're alluding to, which is a non-core employment. What I would call -- we call it comprehensive services, as the name implies, it provides a kind of broader assortment of services in addition to our traditional software in our traditional tax and other services.  There is to my knowledge a lot of switching from clients that are, what I would call typical clients of ADP that have payroll benefits and I'd then maybe TLM, etc., whether it's in a down-market in the mid-market into these HRO Solutions, there is not a lot to my knowledge of switching across because it typically. Again, if we're doing our job from a sales standpoint, you are really trying to find the right fit for the client. In some cases, the client wants you to do their benefits admin, and provide their benefits, provide the workers comp, and their 401-K.  In other cases, the client wants you to only do the administrative back-office of the payroll department in the HR department which would be the non - PEO solutions. So I think if we do our job well, which I think we do in the sales process, and in the upgrade process, those clients tend to stay on those -- on whatever solution they have chosen. But to be clear, both of them are growing at this point at rates that are multiples of our growth in employer services. And so it's quite impressive in terms of the tailwind and the growth rates that we have in all of the HRO businesses.  On the last part of your question, which I think was about positioning PEO in terms of market share and so forth. We have 600 and I think it's 630,000 roughly, we reported worksite employees, average worksite employees this last quarter. That's tripled, what it was 10 years ago in the first quarter of fiscal year 11. And so and that's a higher market share than it was 10 years ago. So I don't know how else to answer that question other than to say that we have a proven track record of execution to continue to drive growth in the PEO that's faster than the markets. So I don't think there's any question about our positioning or our ability to drive market share as evidenced by our ability to execute. So next-gen PEO, equally excited as we are about next-gen HCM in terms of what this holds for the future for ADP. The challenge for us in terms of as we communicate and on November 15th, we'll try to figure out a way to address this issue. Like, we have 15 billion in revenue. So as well as next-gen HCM are going and next-gen payroll is going, it just doesn't -- this is a future impact for ADP., so it's not in the next quarter. And I know you're not asking a question that's really about next quarter mark, but I think it was a good opportunity to kind of throw that out there.  That -- what's driving the performance of ADP this quarter, this year, and for the next 2 to 3 years is not going to be that from a financial standpoint. But in terms of positioning the Company for the future, in terms of growth and creating competitive differentiation and the ability to drive new bookings, they're absolutely critical. So I would say that on those measurements we're still happy and excited by the progress we're seeing with both next-gen HCM, as well as next-gen payroll, we have not gone to general availability, so we're selling a lot of next-gen payroll, but we're only selling in what we call the core of major accounts right now of the mid-market, which is kind of 50 to 150 and this is no different in terms of the playbook that we use with our transition from our old platform to run in a down-market.  And some of our more legacy platform in mid-market to then our next-gen Workforce Now version which we're on now. So we're doing the same thing with next-gen payroll and the same thing with next-gen HCM, which is we're doing very carefully that we have a very large installed base. And we are not -- We're going to eventually move some of those clients, and begin to move some of those clients. But we're happy with the business and the cash flow that we have, and the clients satisfaction scores that are record levels on our existing platform.  So we do not have any -- this is not panicking. There's no sense of crisis, and there's no -- we have urgency, but no crisis, because I want to make sure people hear that. Like, I don't want you to think that we all have a sense of urgency because the faster we get these two solutions to scale, the faster we beat the competition. It's a great question. I think the second part of question, so hopefully you'll forget about first part because we don't have -- we try to prepare for everything and that one, we'll have to follow-up with you on in terms of what regions or what states, we're strongest in terms of our sales. I'm going to suspect that they were all strong because honestly, like the PEO results were off the charts, there can't be any state that wasn't in strong double-digit growth. But we'll follow up on that question. On the healthcare rate question, you're right that we're not directly impacted, but you're also right to imply that we're indirectly impacted because it does matter, right? It matters to our clients what they're paying for healthcare.  And I hate to be so simplistic, but I think what the actual regression to the mean and large economies -- the healthcare world and insurance companies are also similar in terms of they regress, right? So losses have an uncanny way of regressing to the mean. That's why I always caution people when all of a sudden someone thinks that they have this big decline in either workers comp costs or healthcare costs. It usually doesn't work that way. There's usually something that explains it and it usually regresses back to the mean.  I think, if I can try to answer -- what I think is the implication of your question, there was a temporary decline in things like elective surgery, and frankly, healthcare in general. People even start to stop going to their primary care physicians and so forth, that decreased healthcare costs temporarily. And I hate to use that word transitory, that is now the favorite word it seems talk about inflation, but it's very clear that that was transitory and that healthcare costs will come back.  And so I think to the extent you had below normal renewals, which would be our situation because we don't take risk on healthcare, so we wouldn't see it in our margins and in our cost structure. But to the extent that we had below normal renewals, we would expect those renewals to go back to normal because we would expect as healthcare costs go back to normal slowly, that those costs would have to be pass-through.  When you look at the healthcare insurance companies, as much criticism as they get, they are largely pass-through entities. They're paying hospitals, and providers, and other healthcare costs, prescription drugs, etc. And it's really not a business where you can say, we can't pass this 10 percent increase in healthcare costs because their margins are even 10 percent. And so that business is very straightforward, which is they try to earn a markup or margin for doing what they do in terms of managing networks etc. But in the end, they have to pass those costs through. We have to also, because we're a passive entity as well. And I think those who take risk on healthcare will probably see those costs go up over some period of time. Same here. There's not much more I can say as we really had terrific results. I want to thank Don for joining and I think you're all going to be very happy to meet him and get the benefit of his experience in ADP more broadly, besides just in the finance organization. Because he has kind of real-world business experience within ADP as well. The -- I just want to end the way I usually end which is thanking our organization and particularly our front line associates because I'm not sure what's going on in other companies. but we would not be able to get our goals accomplished without people going above and beyond.  I think we mentioned the tight labor market and that we're a little bit behind in terms of our hiring, that means our people are working extra hard. An economist said, that an increase in productivity, I'd say that's just people working hard. And we really appreciate it, our clients appreciate it. I think our shareholders appreciate it, and I don't think a lot listen to this call, but you should be aware of that, whether it's here in other companies, there's a lot of people out there that are pushing really hard to deliver.  And many of us, whether we're as consumers or buyers of products and businesses and so we're frustrated by what's happening in terms of supply chain and some of these other things. But all I see is a bunch of people working really, really hard to try to fulfill the needs of our clients. And I think that's happening across the whole economy. And I think we'd show a little bit of patience with each other.  Because this will all normalize as these variant now recedes, I mean, you're seeing already and some of the mobility data, things will slowly get back to normal. People will come back into the labor force. And this great economy that we have will function, the way it's supposed to function. But in the meantime, I want to thank our associates for what they've done so far, whether it's this last quarter and what they're going to have to do to get through this year-end, which is going to be very challenging given the volumes we have and the capacity we have. So for that, I thank them, but I also thank all of you for listening and for being supporters of ADP. Thank you."

            "name": "Don Mcguire",
            "content": "Thank you, Carlos and everyone on the call good morning. And nice to meet you. Our first quarter represented a strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth on both a reported and organic constant currency basis. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was up a 140 basis points much better than expected, and was supported by higher revenue and overall cost containment. Our tax rate was up slightly in the quarter versus last year. But we also benefited from the elevated pace of share repurchases following our debt issuance in May, combined, those factors contributed to a 17% increase in our adjusted diluted earnings per share.  Moving onto the segments, our Employer Services revenue increased 8% on a reported and organic constant currency basis. Our strong Q1, ES bookings guidance performance, and record retention contributed to this performance. Though, as a reminder, we did continue to lap some of the lower revenues we had last year in some of our volume-related businesses, including recruiting and background screening. Our clients finding interest represented only a slight headwind in the quarter, as our 40 point, basis point decline in average yield was offset by fantastic balanced growth of 22%, driven by client growth and planner growth, higher wages and the lapping of the payroll tax deferral last year.  ES margin increased 150 basis points on strong revenue performance and overall cost containment. As Carlos mentioned, our PEO had another terrific quarter. Average worksite employees increased 15% year-over-year to $629,000 in revenues, excluding zero margin pass - throughs from 20%, supported once again, by favorable mix trends within the PEO employee base, as well as improving SUI rates. Total PEO revenue grew 15%, which included a modest drag from lower zero margin pass-through growth and worksite employee growth as expected. PEO margin was up 70 basis points in the quarter driven by operating leverage. Overall, our Q1 results reflect a very strong start to the year and delivered ahead of our expectations on practically all fronts. Let me now turn to our updated outlook for Fiscal 2022 for ES revenues, we now expect growth for 5% to 6% which we're raising 50 basis points at the midpoint. This is driven by several underlying factors.  We're raising our expected range of ES new bookings growth to 12 to 16%. As we mentioned, we had a better-than-expected performance in Q1 and reached pre -pandemic productivity earlier than we had fore - casted. We haven't made significant changes to our rest of year outlook at this point, but if momentum remains as strong as we've seen it then we may see opportunity to deliver additional upside. We're also raising our ES retention and we're now assuming a decline of 50 basis points off of FY21 all-time highs versus our prior outlook of a decline of 75 basis points. As with bookings, this is primarily a function of the strong Q1 performance. Our continued assumption is that as clients continue to re-engage in the marketplace, we may experience a slight decline over the course of the year. We expect to have significantly more clarity once we get through the calendar year-end period. Where we typically see most of the switching activity. For U.S. pays per control. we're making no change to our outlook of 4% to 5% growth. We continue to expect a gradual recovery in the overall labor market, and the 7% growth in Q1 was about in line with our expectations.  And then for our client funds interest revenue, we're raising our outlook by about $15 million to a range of $420 to $430 million, as we're raising our balanced growth assumptions by about 4%, to growth of 12 to 14%. Our outlook for client funds yield meanwhile is unchanged despite the improvement in the yield environment. Primarily, as our stronger balanced performance actually created a temporary mix shift to overnight investments until new securities are gradually purchased. But that said the favorable shift in the yield curve is clearly helpful to us and we'll certainly benefit our multiyear client funds outlook, all else equal.  For ES margin, we now expect an increase of about 75 to 100 basis points, up from our prior range of 50 to 75 basis points. While we did outperform meaningfully on margin in Q1, we're also seeing some additional expenses over the rest of the year, including higher headcount in our outsourcing businesses. Meanwhile, we continue to expect transformation initiative benefits, including our digital transformation to offset a year-over-year increase in facilities, T&E expenses, and other return to office expenses.  Moving onto the PEO, we now expect PEO revenues to grow 11 to 13%. Average worksite employees to grow 11 to 13% and revenues excluding 0 margin pass - throughs to grow 12 to 14%. This 2% point raise across-the-board is a function of both our strong Q1 bookings and overall performance, as well as an expectation from stronger hiring within our PEO base to contribute over the remainder of the year. RPO was very well-positioned to capitalize on growing levels of client demand coming out of the pandemic. And if we continue to drive outside booking performance over the rest of that of the year, that could represent further upside to our outlook. Following our strong start to the year, we now expect a range of flat to down 50 basis points for the year, for an improvement from our prior expectation of down 25 to 75 basis points on our margin. As a reminder, we are growing over a very strong margin results in fiscal 2021 and are also expecting elevated selling expenses this year from strong bookings performance, Turning them all together for our consolidated outlook, we now expect revenue to grow 7% to 8%. Following the strong 10% Q1 performance, we now expect the remaining quarters to grow closer to 7%, which is higher than our prior forecast.  For adjusted EBITDA margin, we now expect an increase of 50 to 75 basis points. As we shared last quarter, we expect our margin improvement to be back-half-weighted. Most specifically, in the Fourth Quarter. Our current expectation is for a slight margin decline in Q2 and Q3. We're making no change to our tax rate assumption. And with these changes, we now expect growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share of 11% to 13%, as I think you've heard us say a couple of times now we are very pleased with our Q1 results and we're happy to be raising our guidance this early in the year.  This is still a dynamic environment, and there are a wide range of potential outcomes. And we believe our guidance is appropriately balanced given these conditions. However, should our associates continue to drive better-than-expected sales results, client satisfaction, efficiency, and service and implementation. We would see opportunity to deliver additional upside to our outlook. Before to move in Q&A I wanted to share 2 things. First, I look forward to meeting everyone perhaps virtually for now. But eventually in-person as we get back out on the road to meet our shareholders and the investment community. And second is that we are very much looking forward to our upcoming Investor Day in a couple of weeks on November 15th. Having run one of our largest businesses for years, I can tell you there is always much happening here at ADP on the ground. And although it all tends to roll up to a very stable financial picture, I can tell you there's a lot of excitement among our associates for the things they're working on. We hope to share some of that excitement with you in November. And with that, I will now turn it back over to the Operator for Q&A. Yes. Sure. I think it's fair to say and we commented on it that the retention is at an all-time record for our Q1. So that's fantastic and better than we had expected. The expectation as we went into the year was to see particularly in the smaller business statement, to see that slipped back a little. And indeed it has, but it hasn't slipped back nearly to the extent that we had anticipated.  So we're even better there against what we had previously thought. Of course, then that means that we did have and continue to have good retention levels in the mid-market and the upmarket. So we expect that to -- we expect that to continue. However, as you know the cyclicality of our business and the seasonality of our business. We will need to get through the calendar year end, which is when we see most of the switching activity because of the drivers in new starts the year etc. So we are positive and we did take our retention estimate up for the year and we'll see if it holds and perhaps it's better than we expected. Thank you. Yes. So I guess what I would say is I've been with ADP for a long time now. And I guess what I observed in the roughly 23 years I've been with this Company is that ADP has always had a very strong financial organization with a strong finance leader. And I want to make sure that we continue that. I am sure we will. I think that the priorities that we have are well set out in our Strat plan previous Investor Days, etc. So we'll probably provide along with an update on those things that when we get together on November the 15th. But let's wait until then and I don't think you're going to see any dramatic changes. We pretty much have a well-discussed, and well-disclosed trajectory, and plan, and we will update you on that on November the 15th. Maybe I will take that. I think our retention, certainly we're very happy with the Q1 record we have, but I think it's also heavily linked to the success we've had over the last few years with our improvements in NPS. And as our NPS continues to go on the right direction and improved, we're seeing general increases in retention to go along with that, I think that's what we would expect and that's what we want to see happen.  So I think there is some relationship there. The -- with no doubt that the retention is very good and we're benefiting still I think from a little bit of some of the concerns coming out of the pandemic that clients may have about switching it during a time of still virtual for many. So we're benefiting from that as well and we acknowledge that. But as I said, we're very happy with the retention and the progress we're making with our products and our service that go along to driving those retention numbers. We will see a little bit of a step back perhaps in the down-market. But as we said so far, it's soft living up better than we expected."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Michelle, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Danny Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanny Hussain: Thank you, Michelle, and welcome everyone to ADP's fourth quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter and full year. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I'll now turn it over to Maria.\nMaria Black: Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter, that included 9% organic constant currency revenue growth, 270 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion, and 26% adjusted EPS growth, and for a full year fiscal 2023, we delivered 10% organic constant currency revenue growth, 130 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion and 17% adjusted EPS growth, representing another strong year for ADP. I'll start with some highlights from the quarter. Our worldwide sales and marketing team delivered exceptional Q4 Employer Services new business bookings growth that was well in excess of our expectations, with strong double-digit overall growth on top of a difficult comparison. The HCM demand environment has been healthy despite a gradually slowing macroeconomic backdrop and we have been capitalizing on this steady demand. Our strong bookings results were broad-based. We had continued strength in our down-market and Employer Services HRO offerings. We also had better-than-expected results in our midmarket, as well as a great finish from our compliance and international businesses. This Q4 performance brought our full year Employer Services bookings growth to 10% compared to our 6% to 9% guidance and our medium-term goal of 7% and 8% growth that we laid out at our 2021 Investor Day. We are, of course, thrilled with this result and excited to keep the momentum going. Our Employer Services retention rate was another highlight in Q4 and came in better than we expected. For the full year, we delivered a retention rate increase of 10 basis points and are back to our record level retention rate of 92.2%, all while absorbing the impact of normalization in the down-market out of business rates. This strong result was driven by record level retention rate, specifically in our U.S. midmarket and international businesses, and by record level overall client satisfaction across our major businesses in the fourth quarter. Our Employer Services pays per control growth was 3% for the quarter, as the overall labor market continued to show resilience, bringing the full year pays per control figure to 5%. We have been pleased all year to see such durable labor demand from our clients. And last, while our PEO revenue growth performed in line with our expectations this quarter, we were pleased to experience a further acceleration in PEO bookings with strong double-digit growth in Q4, representing another record level sales quarter. Moving on, while Don will cover our fiscal 2024 financial outlook, I wanted to spend a few minutes sharing our strategic priorities as we look ahead. Change and increase in complexity are secular growth drivers for the HCM industry and our breadth enables us to address nearly any HCM challenge our clients may face and meet them wherever they may be on our HR journey. From start-up to enterprise, from software-only to fully outsourced, and from local to global, we see a tremendous growth opportunity in front of us. And while our specific growth initiatives will vary by business, there are three key strategic priorities, which apply across all of ADP, that I see is critical to enabling our growth in the years ahead. The first strategic priority is to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. Put simply, our goal is to design, develop, and deliver the very best and most innovative solutions that will help our clients navigate the full lifecycle of employment from hiring employees to onboarding and training them, providing insurance for them, paying them, and filing payroll taxes, and even setting them up for retirement. As much as we offer today, we see an incredible opportunity to improve on our current and next-gen solutions, tactically use partnerships and inorganic means to further accelerate our pace of innovation and continue to offer industry-leading HCM products. And we expect to have a busy fiscal 2024. For U.S. small businesses, we are rolling out several product enhancements that will serve our 850,000 RUN clients, including a new tax ID registration service, learning management to help with small business employee training and an insurance and sector tool that utilizes AI to help clients manage their workers' compensation insurance policies and annual audits. For U.S. mid-sized businesses served by Workforce Now, our focus is to continue our great momentum in the deployment of our Next Gen Payroll and time engine and to drive our win rates and client satisfaction even higher. In the U.S. enterprise space, we expect to nearly finish the migrations of three of our remaining legacy platforms by the end of this fiscal year, representing an important step in our multi-year journey to move our clients to more modern platforms. We are also pleased to have advanced the velocity of our Next Gen HCM implementations and we expect our Next Gen HCM sales to contribute in a more meaningful way to our bookings growth in fiscal 2024. Outside the U.S., we intend to scale our iHCM midmarket platform in fiscal 2024, adding at least 1,000 clients over the course of the year. I am also incredibly excited to share that we will begin offering role outside the U.S. in fiscal 2024 to drive incremental growth. We plan to launch initially in two countries in Europe and expand its reach from there. And we intend to continue growing our Asia-Pacific business in part by leveraging our recent acquisition of a strong midmarket time product to supplement our existing payroll functionality. And across a few of our platforms, including Workforce Now and Roll, we intend to deploy GenAI-powered features to help our clients more quickly and easily tackle certain HR transactions. Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing to our clients. We pride ourselves on serving as a true partner to each and every one of our one million clients. Our culture of client service applies equally across our entire business from a basic payroll client to a fully outsourced client where we run part or all of the HR department. Our expertise and partnership approach has been key to ADP's winning formula for decades, and we will continue to lean into it. We expect that to manifest in a few ways in fiscal 2024. We have recently been piloting a number of tools powered by GenAI that can help our service and implementation associates deliver an even better client experience, and we will begin deploying these more broadly in early fiscal 2024. Given the significant number of clients we onboard and interact with every year, we expect to learn quite a bit this year about the longer-term benefits we and our clients might realize from GenAI. Meanwhile, demand for our HR outsourcing solutions remains very strong, and in fiscal 2024, we are focused on reaching new clients and further improving the experience for existing ones. Our Employer Services HRO businesses have been performing incredibly well and our focus for fiscal 2024 is to continue delivering strong bookings and keep client satisfaction and retention at current levels or perhaps even reach new record levels. And our focus for our PEO business in fiscal 2024 is to maintain our recent strong bookings momentum by continuing to add to our sales force headcount, grow our referral partner network and use data and machine learning to identify existing ADP clients who maybe a strong fit for an upgrade. Our third and final strategic priority is to leverage our global scale for the benefit of our clients. Our size and scale are unmatched in the industry. Across the globe, we not only offer robust platforms and a commitment to industry-leading service and expertise, but we also provide a scaled ecosystem and a unique on-the-ground presence in over 30 countries. This combination positions us to interact routinely with local governments and tax authorities, meet stringent certification and data requirements, and stay on top of complex and shifting legal requirements. Globally, we bring together our incredible data, an array of partners and integrated solutions, and one of the biggest and best business-to-business sales forces in the world to help our clients and prospects navigate the changing world of work. In fiscal 2024, we will continue to build on that scale for the benefit of our clients. Our GlobalView platform support hundreds of the world's largest multi-national companies with scaled workforces in over 40 countries and our Celergo platform helps us serve thousands more in up to 140 countries. In fiscal 2024, we expect to expand on both as we add additional countries to GlobalView's broad reach and as we potentially make tuck-in acquisitions to enhance our native in-country footprint. After establishing an ADP in-country presence in five new markets in 2023, we expect to expand further in fiscal 2024. Our world-class global scale distribution led by over 8,500 sellers is being supported by headcount and marketing investments in 2024, and as we've shared with you in the past few quarters, our sellers will continue to be paired with a best-in-class sales tech stack, which we plan to enhance with GenAI functionality in the coming months. And our ability to provide data-driven insights will continue to grow in fiscal 2024. ADP serves more clients and pays more people around the world than ever, and as we continue growing the number of employees we serve globally, the power of our insights will likewise continue to increase and benefit our clients. I am incredibly excited about these three strategic priorities for ADP and the differentiation and growth they will continue to drive. But before turning it over to Don, I wanted to take a moment to recognize our associates for their effort and performance over the course of this year. Our associates embody our core values, like insightful expertise, service excellence, and being results-driven. In fiscal 2023, ADP was recognized as the World's Most Admired Company by Fortune Magazine for the 17th consecutive year, signifying the incredibly strong culture we have and the important role we play in the world. Additionally, we were recently recognized, for the first time, as one of the Best Companies for Innovators by Fast Company, a true testament to the direction we are headed in. We owe these accolades as well as our strong consistent financial performance to the commitment and effort of our 63,000 associates that make-up the ADP family. With that, I'll turn it over to Don.\nDon McGuire: Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by expanding on Maria's comments around our Q4 results and then cover our fiscal 2024 financial outlook. Q4 performance is very strong overall, driving fiscal '23 results at or above our expectations. As Maria mentioned, these results reflected broad-based strength in Employer Services and PEO new business bookings, better-than-anticipated Employer Services retention and continued healthy Employer Services pays per control growth, yielding 10% organic constant currency revenue growth for the year and bringing us to $18 billion in revenue. For our Employer Services segment, revenue in the quarter increased 11% on both the reported and organic constant currency basis. This stronger-than-expected revenue growth was a function of continued outperformance in retention and pays per control growth as well as a better-than-anticipated contribution from client funds interest. Our ES margin expanded 480 basis points in the fourth quarter, which was broadly in line with our expectations. For the full year, our ES revenue grew 10% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic constant currency basis, and our ES margin expanded 190 basis points. Growth in client funds interest helped us in a year in which we added a fair amount to our product, service, and sales headcount, which has driven some fairly substantial benefits in sales, Net Promoter Score, and retention results. For our PEO, revenue increased 4% for the quarter, decelerating slightly from Q3, as we anticipated. Average worksite employees increased 3% on a year-over-year basis to 722,000, and has started to gradually reaccelerate, supported by very strong bookings growth in Q4. PEO margin contracted 110 basis points in the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations due in part to higher selling expenses. For the full year, our PEO revenue grew 8% and average worksite employees increased 6% and our margin expanded 60 basis points, all in line with our most recent guidance. I'll now turn to our outlook for fiscal '24. While the economic backdrop remains uncertain, we continue to believe we are well-positioned to deliver solid overall financial results, while also investing for future growth, consistent with the strategic priorities that Maria laid out. Our fiscal '24 outlook assumes a moderation in economic activity over the course of the year, but nothing dramatic. Beginning with ES segment revenue, we expect growth of 7% to 8% driven by the following key assumptions. We expect ES new business bookings growth of 4% to 7%, representing a solid growth after a particularly strong fiscal '23. For now, we're assuming a stronger first half and some moderation in second half bookings growth, which we think is prudent, given the limited visibility into the macro environment. For ES retention, we finished fiscal '23 at a record level of 92.2%, consistently outperforming our expectations throughout the year. We are, of course, very pleased with this performance as we overcame headwinds from higher down-market out of business levels with strength elsewhere. With that said, we are contemplating a 50 to 70 basis points ES retention decline for fiscal '24, due in part to an assumption that small business losses will increase slightly from where they are today as well as an assumption for general impact to our other businesses from a slowing economic backdrop. As we called out three months ago, we see the potential for below normal pays per control growth in fiscal '24 and our outlook assumes 1% to 2% growth for the year. We had a strong Q4, which gives us a solid starting point for growth and a gradual deceleration over the course of the year feels reasonable at this time. And after price contributed 150 basis points to our ES revenue growth in fiscal '23, we are anticipating a smaller contribution in fiscal '24, though still above our recent historical average contribution of around 50 basis points. And for client funds interest revenue, the interest rate backdrop has been dynamic these past few months, and is important to keep in mind that our client funds interest revenue forecast reflects the current forward yield curve, which will, of course, evolve as we move through fiscal '24. At this point, we expect our average yield to increase from 2.4% in fiscal '23 to 2.8% in fiscal '24. We, meanwhile, expect our average client funds balances to grow 2% to 3% in fiscal '24, this is a bit lower than recent trends, due primarily to more modest contribution from pays per control growth and an assumption for more moderate wage increases. Putting those together, we expect our client funds interest revenue to increase from $813 million in fiscal '23 to a range of $955 million to $975 million in fiscal '24. Meanwhile, we expect the net impact from our client fund strategy to increase from $730 million in fiscal '23 to a range of $815 million to $835 million in fiscal '24. For our ES margin, we expect an increase of 130 to 150 basis points, driven by operating leverage and contribution from client funds interest revenue, offset by continued investments across our strategic priorities. Moving on to the PEO segment. We expect PEO revenue and PEO revenue, excluding zero margin pass-through, to grow 3% to 5% in fiscal '24. The primary driver for our PEO revenue growth is our outlook for average worksite employee growth of 3% to 4%. This represents a gradual reacceleration from the 3% growth we're stepping off in Q4. Strong bookings performance has already contributed to accelerating client growth, but that has so far been offset by slowing pays per control growth. With continued strong bookings growth, our worksite employee growth should gradually accelerate as well. And as Maria shared, demand has been healthy and we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity in PEO. We expect PEO margin to be down between 20 and 40 basis points in fiscal '24, due to anticipated higher selling expenses, as well as year-over-year headwind from a lower workers' compensation reserve release benefit than we experienced in fiscal '23. Adding it all up, our consolidated revenue outlook is for 6% to 7% growth in fiscal '24 and our adjusted EBIT margin outlook is for expansion of 60 to 80 basis points. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '24 to be around 23%. And we expect adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12%, supported by buybacks. One quick note on cadence. At this point, we expect total revenue growth to be relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter. We expect our adjusted EBIT margin to be down slightly in Q1 on a year-over-year basis, and then build over the course of the year. Thank you, and I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\nOwen Callahan: Hi, this is Owen on for Ramsey. I appreciate you taking our question today. I was just curious more on kind of your PEO revenue guidance. I know you called out worksite employee growth weighing on growth there, but you expect double-digit kind of bookings growth and projects only 3% to 5% growth in PEO revenues for fiscal '24. I was just curious if you can provide any more color on that spread is any conservatism or if there are any other factors to consider there. Thank you.\nDon McGuire: Hi, Owen, thanks. Yes, I'll answer the question. We had a very, very strong sales bookings result in Q4. So we're very happy with that, and we've seen the sales reaccelerate. I think as we said in the prepared comments, we are seeing continued growth in clients. I think if there is a challenge that we're facing a little bit as we're seeing a little bit softer pays per control growth in the PEO than we would have expected. But back to what we've been saying for some time, we think the underlying value proposition is very, very strong and we look to that business continue to grow for us and be a big part of our portfolio.\nOwen Callahan: Understood. I appreciate that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good morning. Congrats on the strong end to the fiscal year. Maybe first question, Maria, I thought it was - is very interesting about the announcement of moving Roll into new international markets. How should we think about maybe what the opportunity there looks like? How much different is the complexity around payroll processing in international markets versus the U.S. and have you included that in the bookings forecast for fiscal '24?\nMaria Black: Yes, fair enough. Thanks, Samad, and I appreciate the congratulations on the quarter and the year. We're, obviously, pretty proud over here. So with respect to Roll, it is exciting. It's been an exciting product for us to rollout, no pun intended, across the down-market here in the U.S. We're excited to take it into international. As mentioned, the initial goal is to put it into two countries. And it is an incremental add for us because it's really initially into these two countries. We're thinking more kind of the down-market SMB space, which is an area of opportunity for us across many of the markets that we serve. But we're also excited about Roll long-term beyond that space. So excited to dip it into our international space as we continue the overall rollout of Roll. In terms of factoring it into the overall bookings, not really. I think the - by the time the launch happens and as we're thinking about the full year for our international business or full year for new business bookings, I'd be surprised if it ultimately makes a dent, but to us, it's really about the long-term value that that offer will bring as we seek to expand the addressable market for us into these various places. Last but not least, Samad, you mentioned the complexity of being international. And I have to tell you, I spoke to it a little bit in the prepared remarks. There's a lot that goes into being in each one of these countries. To your point, there is complexity country-by-country. Many countries put many of the states that are complex here in the U.S. to shame in terms of the complexity that provides, and that's everything from government entities, legal and tax attorneys, who's the tax authority and how do you get to them. We often think of it as an ecosystem. We think about it as kind of that final mile, if you will, and that's the complexity and that's what we've been building over the last couple of decades in our international business. So it's a lot more than dropping off software at a country border and hoping that it works. There's a lot to be said for the ecosystem around it. Again, whether it's tax authorities, data lodgement, things of that nature. So excited to take advantage of the footprint we've built and put in our product into that footprint as we expand Roll internationally.\nSamad Samana: Very helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Don. I know you gave - you called out that broad-based strength that drove the bookings upside and you cited several specific factors. I guess, it would be helpful if you could maybe help us dimensionalize where the upside was relative to the company's own expectations at maybe the start of fiscal '23 and what you're carrying forward from what you saw in the fourth quarter into the FY '24 bookings outlook?\nDon McGuire: Yes, thanks for the question. I'll start here and I think I'll turn over to Maria for the bookings. But we certainly saw strength across the Board. I think once again, in the prepared remarks, we called out the - our tax business and our international business. So they were very strong amongst all the ones that were strong and the down-market was also quite strong. So it was really a contribution from across the Board in the fourth quarter. We talked for some time about how the pipelines are healthy and whatnot, and you had questions before about times to get signatures on deals, et cetera, things came together in the fourth quarter and we were very, very pleased with the final result.\nMaria Black: That's right. My only add to that comment would be, we stepped into the quarter with healthy pipelines, with a strong staffing position that was growing tenure. I have to tell you when I reflect on all the quarters that I've watched across our sales execution, generally speaking, you have a bunch of businesses that are outperforming and you have a few businesses that are perhaps being carried by those that are outperforming. What I have to tell you is, this was a broad-based strength across the entire organization sales implementation service with kind of an all-hands-on-deck execution, and that's really what it's all about. What I would attribute it to is incredible execution.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thank you. Appreciate you taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on U.S. bookings here. So you cited several areas of strength, midmarket compliance, international. On the midmarket, specifically, can you talk about what's driving that better-than-expected performance, do you think that's driving improved competitive performance versus kind of rising tide environment? And then just - I heard your comment on Next Gen HCM contributing more in the current fiscal year to bookings. Maybe talk about the initiatives in the product development that you think is going to drive that.\nMaria Black: Good morning, Bryan. So I'll comment on both. The mid-market strength that we've seen and coming in a bit better than expected. It's been solid for quite some time. That's inclusive of our HRO offerings, and as you know, we've been speaking to those quite a bit in terms of the resonance of that value proposition in the market. So I think that adds to the overall strength that we have in the mid-market, which is the various flavors and offers that we have. I think the other is that we've made tremendous investments into that business. So we do have our next-generation payroll engine that the sales force is pretty excited about and we're seeing that in the wins that are coming in and just kind of the momentum there. I think the other is the amount of product investment and innovation that we've done in the mid-market, specifically referencing the investments we've made into the Workforce Now platform with the new UX and many of the things that I've been speaking to. And I think the other call out is it definitely helps on a new business bookings perspective, when the business on the other side, so service and NPS, if you will, as well as retention are firing on all cylinders. And that's exactly the case. We have record retention in our mid-market, and we have near-record MPS results across the mid-market. So really, really proud of the execution in that entire space. And that definitely fuels and feeds the ability for our sellers to get excited about everything that I just mentioned to go-to-market. Stepping into the question around next-gen HCM, I did make a reference to that. We've talked a lot over the last quarters about this year. And what we've been working on is scaling implementation, and that's exactly what we've done in that business. So, we were able to onboard a lot of the clients, that we had on our backlog. We've shortened the time of implementation, and we also saw additions to that backlog. So, we saw new sales in the fourth quarter of that next-generation HCM platform. We're really excited about the momentum as we step into '24. And as such, we believe that Next Gen HCM will be a larger contributor to bookings for us in the upcoming years than it was in '23, but we were pleased with what we saw in the fourth quarter and the momentum heading in.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Understood. And then just on pricing, can you comment on where that ended up in fiscal '23 and what you're assuming in ES growth from a pricing standpoint in fiscal '24?\nDon McGuire: Yes. So, we were happy with our price increase and retention. So as we've talked to many times, we want to make sure that we're not getting greedy. So, we did get about 150 basis points of price in the year. And we did that without the expense of seeing a decline in retention or NPS scores. And quite frankly, those NPS scores have stayed healthy despite the price increase. So as much as price increases can land well, they have landed well, and we're very happy with how that transpired throughout '23. For '24, we do expect to have price increases again. We do not think that we're going to be in the 150 basis point range. We're certainly going to be above our historical average of about 50 basis points. But once again, we'll watch closely and make sure that the underlying value proposition for our clients stays in place, and we'll take some price for sure, but not to the extent that we did in FY '23.\nBryan Bergin: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi, thanks so much. Yes. With the great bookings here, I'm just thinking around the conversion. You mentioned implementation cycles. I'm just curious if you've seen any change from clients and their desire to implement. And then similarly, just maybe based on your comments there on next-gen HCM, I'd love to hear a little bit more around the appetite from your prospects to upgrade now at this point in the cycle. What's the pitch here given some of the macro uncertainty?\nMaria Black: So, I think both of your questions, I just want to confirm, I'm hearing them the right way. I think they both kind of speak to the general sentiment around the demand environment.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes.\nMaria Black: Is that kind of a good way to think about it in terms of decisions getting delayed and/or what's the appetite to, I suppose, by HCM in the current macro environment. And so, I'll comment on the general demand environment and feel free to follow-up with an additional question if I didn't cover what you wanted. But the way that I think about demand, and I've spoken to it quite a bit over the last couple of quarters. Demand remains strong, and that is very broad-based across the business. And so, if you think about the down market, you still have the strength of small business formations. You have the strength of hiring that's happening in the down market. And as such you have clients there needing to make decisions around our HCM offers in that space, right? So that's definitely a place that we've been winning, and we'll continue to lean in as warranted by the demand. The mid-market, as we talked about that a little bit earlier in terms of the overall demand there for the complexity that exists in that market. That's inclusive again of the solution we have around our HR outsourcing offerings. And so that's kind of the mid-market. So getting to your question, which is really about the enterprise space and perhaps even the MNC space, it is an area that we continue to watch as it relates to demand cycles, decision delays. And the main reason is those are really the places that you, as you're aware, have additional, perhaps signers, additional levels of approval, things of that nature. And what I would say, which is consistent with what we've been seeing, is that we are back to pre-pandemic levels. So deal cycles did shorten during the pandemic, and they elongated back the pre-pandemic. But it isn't something that we're seeing additional elongation beyond historical averages. And so to your point, though, it is an area that we consistently watch both in the enterprise space as well as in our international business, just to kind of see if the demand cycle is at the client's appetite to make buying decisions or implementation decisions during this time has changed thus far, we're not seeing it in a broad-based way. But it is an area we continue to monitor.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Okay. No, that's great. You answered it better than I asked the question. So thanks for that. Just on the - as a quick follow-up, just I heard a lot about the sales and the go-to-market investments that makes sense. Just how about R&D growth here in the upcoming year versus fiscal '23? How might growth be different? And also, how might the composition be different in terms of where you're placing your bets on R&D? Thanks, that's all I have.\nDon McGuire: Yes. I think we have a number of projects that we've shared with you all over the past number of quarters. Those projects are well underway. We won't take a lot of time talking about specific Gen AI product projects, but I guess that would be a place that would anticipate I'll get a question we'll get a question for that later on in this call, given it's so topical. But generally, we're continuing our direction with the investments that we've described over the past number of quarters, and we continue to make good progress. We continue to have good delivery. The ability to take RUN to markets in Europe is an example of that, how investments in that development in that technology has increased. And by the way, that's part of our broader strategy that we've touched on many times, is to take some of these developments and make sure that they're global in nature as opposed to only local in nature. So nothing incredibly new, just a continuation of the great work and the great projects we have underway.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Hi, good morning. And let me add my congratulations, particularly on the strong new bookings. Maria, you went through your three key strategic initiatives and all the subsections - of the various initiatives which ones are going to be the most impactful do you think from a near-term perspective? And then one specific question. Within the mid-market, you mentioned not only deploying next-gen payroll, but you also talked about the time engine. And I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that?\nMaria Black: Sure. And thank you, Mark. I appreciate the congratulations. So, I am very excited about the strategic priorities, as I outlined during the prepared remarks. I don't know that I was necessarily expecting to have to pick a favorite pillar or a - one that I expect to yield impact faster than another because I think broadly speaking, they apply across all of ADP, and they will depend a bit as it relates to kind of each business, right? And so, when I think about some of the product investments that we're making. Some of the things, the work that we've done and the impact, whether it's taking a product like roll internationally, which I mentioned earlier, will be short-term results, but some of the impact of continuing to build on the momentum we have in the mid-market with our next-generation payroll engine, as an example, where we have an ability to win differently, we see competitive advantages and differentiation there. I think that's an area that can have tremendous impact in short order. I think the other is Don did it first, which is he mentioned the likes of generative AI. And when I think about that, the Gen AI and applying it broadly across these pillars, I think there is opportunity for us in product that's pretty tremendous, whether it's solving real opportunities for our clients to become more efficient. We've talked a lot about that, whether that's things like job descriptions, performance reviews, things of that nature. But it also leads me kind of to that second pillar to your point around what will come short-term versus long-term. I think there's opportunity in the short-term that will make impact as well as the long-term, in terms of really applying generative AI across our expertise that we provide to our clients. And so, when I think about our ability to make it easier for our clients to engage with us or our associates to engage with our clients, some of the tools that - we have already deployed across various businesses and will further deploy into fiscal '24, such as - think of it almost as a copilot agent assist where we're helping our agents be more efficient. That's going to yield short-term results, if nothing else in client satisfaction. And again, we know happy clients lead to a longer staying clients that leads to more sales and the wheel, if you will. So, I think there are opportunities across all of the strategic priorities to have some impact us sooner than the long-term. But yes, I'm equally excited about all of them. And certainly, we spoke quite a bit about the global piece. In terms of the next-generation time engine, that is being developed in tandem with our next-generation payroll engine. And those two things are really about time and payroll sitting together in our mid-market. It is a based on the same backbone of technology. And so, we're very excited to take that more broadly across the mid-market as we continue to take the next generation payroll engine also more broadly crossed. And I think, both of those things will get feathered into the impact of our win rates, if you will, and our new business bookings in the mid-market throughout the course of '24.\nMark Marcon: That's great. And then, Don, you mentioned the margin expectations for the full year. And you mentioned that in the first quarter, it's probably going to be a little bit lower and then feather up over the course of the year. How much lower during the first quarter? And what's the driver there? And then how should we think about the pacing of the improvement quarter-to-quarter?\nDon McGuire: Yes, Mark, thanks for the question. We're not looking at a big change in the first quarter, but just a couple of the drivers. Just to be clear. One, we do have some incremental investment in cost and headcount, et cetera. But the other big driver in the first quarter is it's a big borrowing quarter for us in our laddered client fund interest strategy. So that's going to put a little bit of pressure on the margin for the fourth - sorry, for the first quarter. And the margin will continue to build over the course of the year, and we will get the overall improvement that we expected, but more out of the three quarters as opposed to the first.\nMark Marcon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nEugene Simuni: Thank you. Good morning, guys. I want to come back to the PEO for a second. So great to hear about strong PEO bookings in the fourth quarter and going into the New Year. Can you provide a bit more color on what helped generate this reacceleration in bookings? I know you talked in the past, Maria, about some of the actions you guys have taken to generate PEO sales, I would love to hear what caused the acceleration in bookings? And are those initiatives that as kind of levers you're pulling now completely pulled or is it still work in progress and will continue into FY '24?\nMaria Black: Sure. Good morning, Eugene. PEO bookings, again, we're incredibly pleased with the results in the fourth quarter and the reacceleration. We also did see the reacceleration in the third quarter. So the back half of the PEO was exactly as you suggested. It was a lot of focus for the management team, and I'm really excited about how we came together to execute. And in terms of the overall demand trends in long-term, short term. I remain bullish on the overall value proposition of the PEO and the demand that it warrants. It's hard in that business to kind of pin down the demand trends, because there are so many variables. And in the PEO, it's not as simple as looking at just leads and number of request for proposals that are coming in, because as you know, not every client as a potential fits. So it's a little a little difficult to pin down kind of the various demand trends in the specificity outside of the overall belief in the demand environment. And there's a normal level of kind of variability as it relates to PEO bookings quarter-to-quarter, which also makes it hard to kind of spot various trends. Some of that has to do with the calendar year-end. Some of that has to do with when renewals happen. But nonetheless, there was a tremendous amount of focus and still remains. We remain very focused as a team across all of the leadership to make sure that we continue to drive the strong growth in bookings in the PEO in '24.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, probably for Don. We talked about margin costs a little bit. So you expect another year of robust margin improvement next year. But obviously, you're not going to have as much tailwind in revenue growth as you had this year. And if you kind of do some of the [bet and Roll] math, it looks like your adjusted OpEx will need to grow slower next year than it did this year for you to hit your goal. So just hoping maybe you can talk a little bit, what are, the areas of spend where you will temper next year or maybe pullback, especially if macro conditions are not as good as kind of we expect them to be?\nDon McGuire: Yes. So thanks for the question. Let me start by what won't change. So what won't change is that we'll continue to make sure that we invest in key areas of the business to make sure that we can run it effectively. And with the strong bookings, we'll make sure that we have the people on the ground for implementation to get those deals up and running and generating revenue for us, et cetera. But in the last year, we did have pretty substantial growth in, over the last couple of years coming out of the pandemic. I can't believe we're still talking about the pandemic. But as we came out of the pandemic, we did have substantial growth in expenses in service, implementation, sales, et cetera. And while we do continue to expect to see some growth, we're not going to see as much growth in expenses in those areas. So that would be one of the areas that is going to make sure and you hit on it with respect to OpEx. We're not going to see the growth in OpEx expense that we saw in the prior year. The other contributor, of course, that will continue to contribute. I think, the yield curve is more favorable than it was the last time I spoke to you all. We will get contribution from client fund interest next year. But at the same time, it's not going to be to the extent that we did in '23. So that's also going to help with driving margins higher. But once again, not the same tailwind - tailwinds that we had in '23. I think those are the main items that are going to help us improve our margins going into next year.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Very helpful. Yes perhaps.\nOperator: Thank you. Our question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Wurtzel: Hi, good morning guys. And thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Don, first on the cadence of revenue growth. I know you said it should be relatively stable throughout the year, but wondering if you can maybe sort of parse that out between ES and PEO if there's any differences we should think about there?\nDon McGuire: Yes. So, I think revenue growth is going to be - revenue growth is going to be pretty consistent throughout the year as we start the - as we start that big backlog that we now have as a result of that very, very strong fourth quarter bookings result. So, we will see consistency there. Likewise with PEO, it's going to be a bit of a slower burn as we did have strong sales in Q4. So, we did also talk about slightly lower pace control growth in the PEO business. So - but I don't think they're really going to be that different. I think, they're going to be pretty close if you think about the overall growth, and consolidate the results for the company not substantially different between the business units.\nDanyal Hussain: Yes, Scott, there is a slightly different cadence for the two, it's not a huge difference. For PEO, we do expect an acceleration over the course of the year. So, the contribution we get from our bookings and from the improvements in retention, we're expecting gradually overcoming slowing pays per control that should lead to an accelerating PEO revenue growth. And on ES, we're expecting some deceleration assuming pay per control decelerate and assuming the contribution from client funds interest starts to fade gradually over the course of the year. So you end up with two different-looking ramps, but they offset and that what nets us to a very stable revenue growth overall.\nScott Wurtzel: Got it. It's very helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up on the Gen AI topic, going back to it. Obviously, there's a lot to sort of be excited about there. But just kind of wondering the magnitude of investment needed there, is that investment essentially all incremental to your investment plans for the year? Or have you had to maybe put some other projects on the back burner to focus a little more on Gen AI?\nMaria Black: Yes. And so said differently, the good news is we just went through our strategic plan process in the last six months. And so, we had all of our priority sequence in all of our investments and incremental investments lined up. As we marry that to Gen AI, we have a very clear lens on where some projects may get enhanced and where some projects may look different and perhaps get replaced by a new way of thinking about it. And so candidly speaking, we're going through a lot of these opportunities at this juncture kind of thinking through the bets and there will be incremental investment. And there will be other investments that we repurposed to go do some of these things - in a new way. So, the answer is both.\nScott Wurtzel: Got it. Thanks guys. And congrats on the results.\nMaria Black: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Christiansen with Citi. Your line is open.\nPeter Christiansen: Thank you. Good morning. I'll also add to the congratulations ratio. Nice trends. Maria, a question on the international scaling effort here. I was just wondering if you could - in this context, if you could put some parameters on expected investment spend, I guess, over the next one to two years? And do you see M&A as an important contributor to the growth algorithm there?\nMaria Black: Sure. You started with a question on international. So is the rest of your question about international or is it just in general?\nPeter Christiansen: Correct.\nMaria Black: About international. Yes. So, we have been, over the years, been making in-country decisions on investments. I talked a lot about the, call it, the feet on the street, the final mile of infrastructure that we have to support our international business. And so, we will continue to do that. That's inclusive of each year. We go into new markets and some of those are organic ways that we go into new markets. Some of those are actually partners that we ultimately end up at some point, call it, purchasing, if you will, or acquiring. And so, the answer is both organic and inorganic. That's kind of how we've built the business over the last 20 years. And we will continue where warranted to think about it both ways. And the decision criteria for us is really about speed. A lot of times, it's our clients that pulled us into incremental markets. When I think about the five markets that we went into this year or the two countries that we're heading into with global view, they're byproduct of clients that are choosing to pay employees in certain markets. And as such, for us, a lot of times the decision we make on how to get there, has a lot to do with speed. And as such, again, we will leverage both organic and inorganic ways to get there. So, I don't know, Don, you ran our international business for a very long time. I don't know if you want to add anything.\nDon McGuire: Yes, maybe just to add, I think what we've been doing, Peter, over the last number of years is we have done a number of acquisitions. They've been mostly tuck-ins, but we did have three interesting ones over the last year. We acquired an Italian company that has a good budget payroll - budgeting software tool that's very prominent in the Italian market. We acquired our - so it streamlines [indiscernible] partner in South Africa. And we also want a very exciting mid-market time-and-attendance product called SecureX in out of Bangalore in India. So - and that product is available in India, most of Southeast Asia and the Middle East. So, I think that's a demonstration of what we've been doing, we've been looking at and focused on to continue to make sure we grow that footprint, and we do think it continues to be an exciting space for us.\nPeter Christiansen: Thanks. That's great. And Don, just as a follow-up, last slide on the maturation schedule of client fund investments, super helpful. But as we think about intra-year investment turnover - should that correlate with the seasonal balance levels that we typically see?\nDon McGuire: Yes. So I think as those - investments mature, you're going to see those investments reinvested at higher rates, and we do expect to see our average return go up over the course of the year. The current reinvestment schedules, overnights are reinvesting at 5%. The extended in the loan portfolios are being reinvested at about 4%.We don't expect to see a huge change in the mix. Although the average duration of our investments has shortened a little bit over the last couple of years. But you can pretty much look at those yields, look at the maturity schedule that we provided and then look at the composition of our portfolio across the overnight, the extended and the long and pretty much come to a conclusion or come to some numbers on where you think we're going to end up.\nPeter Christiansen: Thanks. And just one quick one. How should we think about the duration strategy, I guess, for the next couple of quarters here now that the Fed is perhaps kind of like stabilized, but are - is there an effort to extend duration shorten it? Just any sense there would be helpful? And thank you.\nDon McGuire: Yes. We've had this question a few times, and - the answer is we've been very successful with the strategy that we've had for the last 20 years. We certainly see that there is an opportunity cost not ever having everything in short today. At the same time, we do believe that the yield curve will normalize and the strategy we've had in place will come back and be beneficial to us over the longer term. So you shouldn't expect any significant change in our investment strategy.\nPeter Christiansen: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Thank you very much. I wanted to go back quickly on retention. I know you've touched on it a little bit. Last year, your initial outlook called for around 50 - minus 50 to minus 25 basis points of retention degradation. But that obviously didn't really play out. And this year, you're starting with a more conservative kind of minus 70 to minus 50. But I'm hoping you could speak to how much conservatism is embedded there? And what are the drivers that you're seeing as a reason to be a little bit more conservative to start than maybe you were last year even?\nMaria Black: Yes, fair. It's a fair observation, James. Appreciate it. I think the we thought about - by the way, I wish I knew the answer, right? So the question you're asking which is how much conservatism is in there? And that's all to say and you hit the nail on the head, we set into this year guiding minus 25 to 50, we're stepping into fiscal '24 with a guide of minus 50 to 70 - and we hope - I'll end - or I'll start with, we're very happy with where things are. We're firing on all cylinders. We have many businesses that have record MPS results, record retention results and everything is good. And so as we step into the year, the way that we are modeling what you would see in pays per control. The way we're thinking about the potential macroeconomic tempering, if you will, specifically in the back half, is really a byproduct of how we see retention. Part of what we saw in the fourth quarter that led to the incredible results that we had was that the normalization that we've been seeing in the down-market, we did actually see the down market bounce a little bit. So even while it was down year-on-year, it came in stronger than we expected. And so we do anticipate that we may need to give some of that back, which is why we believe it was prudent to align our retention targets through our medium-term targets that we gave back in the Investor Day of 2021. So I wish I knew the answer to your question in terms of how much conservatism, why we are guiding to what we're guiding is really about the economic outlook, whether that's GDP, unemployment is still at record lows. We haven't seen unemployment rates that low since the 60s. And so our guess is as good as yours at some level, but we did build in some tempering of the economy in the back half, and that's really what's yielding that guide on the retention.\nJames Faucette: Great. I appreciate that color, Maria. That's really helpful and makes a lot of sense. I want to turn quickly also to M&A. You mentioned it in the prepared remarks, also, I mentioned it as part of at least some of your strategic initiatives. What are you seeing in terms of overall valuation levels? And what kind of things would you be targeting in terms of geography or product capabilities? Thanks a lot.\nDon McGuire: Yes, James. So in terms of what we're targeting, what we're talking about, there's always things kicking around, of course, but we want to make sure that anything that we do acquire either fits well in the core and gives us additional capability, or it's something that really exceeds some functionality capability that we currently have, so that we're not stacking on more and more product on top of what we already have. The other area, of course, is to make sure that - we do things that are natural adjacencies - are very strong adjacencies to what we already do so that they fit well. And then thirdly, of course, is making sure that we can sell these things and run these things in a recurring model, so that we can sell them the way we sell everything else we sell today and operate them and expect to get revenue anticipation and good model from what we buy. So I think those are the things we think about. I think we're hearing a lot around valuations coming down in the press, certainly a little bit of a dearth of activity, if you will, in the M&A space these days. But we do have lots of conversations about acquisitions and whatnot. I still think, of course, everybody is looking to get a premium what they have. And we're trying to make sure that if we're going to buy something, we're paying the right price. But we don't actually get to the point of many of these conversations given the conditions that I stated at the front at the outset to actually have a view on overall valuations in the market. We likely get to talking about valuation in a very, very few number of cases. Remembering, of course, very, very few of the opportunities we get even get to that conversation. So I don't think I can say we have a general view. But we are focused on what we would have to pay and how things would fit into ADP.\nJames Faucette: That's great. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKartik Mehta: Maria and Don, you've obviously talked a lot about the PEO and seems that the demand has really picked up. But I'm wondering, are you seeing any of your customers maybe taking a little bit of a breather now pointing to sign up for the PEO because of the uncertainty in the economy and that being maybe more expensive product?\nMaria Black: The PEO has a tremendous value proposition. I think we always refer to ADP as an all-weather company. I would say the most durable of our all-weather businesses is the PEO. And a lot of that has to do with the ability to flex that value proposition in a downturn pretty quickly. So if you think about clients that are growing, they enjoy the PEO because it's a quick go-to-market. On the downside, if you will, as clients are potentially trying to work through economic headwinds, the PEO serves as a place that has a clear return on investment, has a total cost of ownership that's very again, very clear. And so I think it's a business that not to suggest that it's not impacted by a downturn, but it's a business that kind of works in both. What I would say is our sales force, we're able to pivot that narrative and that value proposition as warranted. I don't believe that has happened. So to answer the question, our clients at this point, hesitant to purchase something such as the PEO that's so comprehensive because of the macroeconomic challenges. And my view would be, no. I think that's substantiated by the record results that we had in the PEO bookings in the quarter. We also saw that strength in bookings in the third quarter. So I think that value proposition is holding firm. And I think it's a business that should - should the economic wins ever come to life that we've been expecting for so long. It's a business that can pivot pretty quickly and the demand for the offer remains.\nKartik Mehta: And then just a follow-up. Don, you talked about obviously pays per control and retention and maybe retention moderating as the year goes through. For pay per control, would you anticipate that just to get to flat by the end of the year? Or are you anticipating that, that could potentially go negative, and that's how you've built the guidance?\nDon McGuire: No. We're certainly not anticipating this as you go negative. We do, though, think it's going to go to somewhere ever 1% to 2%, which is a little bit less than our historical average. However, I just want to make sure that everybody understands, we're exiting the year pretty healthily. So we figure we're off to a pretty good start, but we do expect that we're going to see a bit of a decline over the next three, four quarters. And once again, we're aligning ourselves to the best we can with unemployment forecasts and et cetera.\nDanny Hussain: Karthik, if you're asking specifically about where we're exiting fiscal '24, then the pay per control is effectively decelerating from this kind of 3% range to something flatter.\nKartik Mehta: Okay. Perfect. Thanks Danny. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Maria Black for closing remarks.\nMaria Black: Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. As you've heard, Don and I, the entire leadership team we're incredibly pleased with fiscal '23, specifically the fourth quarter and the finish. So I'll kind of end where I started, which is, I want to take the opportunity to once again thank the associates that create this performance. It's an unbelievable magical thing to watch it all come together and deliver what we just delivered. And so my gratitude and I celebrate each and every one of them. I also want to thank all of the stakeholders, including all of you who listen today, appreciate the support. We're certainly excited for fiscal '24. So cheers to that.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This concludes the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter, that included 9% organic constant currency revenue growth, 270 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion, and 26% adjusted EPS growth, and for a full year fiscal 2023, we delivered 10% organic constant currency revenue growth, 130 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion and 17% adjusted EPS growth, representing another strong year for ADP. I'll start with some highlights from the quarter. Our worldwide sales and marketing team delivered exceptional Q4 Employer Services new business bookings growth that was well in excess of our expectations, with strong double-digit overall growth on top of a difficult comparison. The HCM demand environment has been healthy despite a gradually slowing macroeconomic backdrop and we have been capitalizing on this steady demand. Our strong bookings results were broad-based. We had continued strength in our down-market and Employer Services HRO offerings. We also had better-than-expected results in our midmarket, as well as a great finish from our compliance and international businesses. This Q4 performance brought our full year Employer Services bookings growth to 10% compared to our 6% to 9% guidance and our medium-term goal of 7% and 8% growth that we laid out at our 2021 Investor Day. We are, of course, thrilled with this result and excited to keep the momentum going. Our Employer Services retention rate was another highlight in Q4 and came in better than we expected. For the full year, we delivered a retention rate increase of 10 basis points and are back to our record level retention rate of 92.2%, all while absorbing the impact of normalization in the down-market out of business rates. This strong result was driven by record level retention rate, specifically in our U.S. midmarket and international businesses, and by record level overall client satisfaction across our major businesses in the fourth quarter. Our Employer Services pays per control growth was 3% for the quarter, as the overall labor market continued to show resilience, bringing the full year pays per control figure to 5%. We have been pleased all year to see such durable labor demand from our clients. And last, while our PEO revenue growth performed in line with our expectations this quarter, we were pleased to experience a further acceleration in PEO bookings with strong double-digit growth in Q4, representing another record level sales quarter. Moving on, while Don will cover our fiscal 2024 financial outlook, I wanted to spend a few minutes sharing our strategic priorities as we look ahead. Change and increase in complexity are secular growth drivers for the HCM industry and our breadth enables us to address nearly any HCM challenge our clients may face and meet them wherever they may be on our HR journey. From start-up to enterprise, from software-only to fully outsourced, and from local to global, we see a tremendous growth opportunity in front of us. And while our specific growth initiatives will vary by business, there are three key strategic priorities, which apply across all of ADP, that I see is critical to enabling our growth in the years ahead. The first strategic priority is to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. Put simply, our goal is to design, develop, and deliver the very best and most innovative solutions that will help our clients navigate the full lifecycle of employment from hiring employees to onboarding and training them, providing insurance for them, paying them, and filing payroll taxes, and even setting them up for retirement. As much as we offer today, we see an incredible opportunity to improve on our current and next-gen solutions, tactically use partnerships and inorganic means to further accelerate our pace of innovation and continue to offer industry-leading HCM products. And we expect to have a busy fiscal 2024. For U.S. small businesses, we are rolling out several product enhancements that will serve our 850,000 RUN clients, including a new tax ID registration service, learning management to help with small business employee training and an insurance and sector tool that utilizes AI to help clients manage their workers' compensation insurance policies and annual audits. For U.S. mid-sized businesses served by Workforce Now, our focus is to continue our great momentum in the deployment of our Next Gen Payroll and time engine and to drive our win rates and client satisfaction even higher. In the U.S. enterprise space, we expect to nearly finish the migrations of three of our remaining legacy platforms by the end of this fiscal year, representing an important step in our multi-year journey to move our clients to more modern platforms. We are also pleased to have advanced the velocity of our Next Gen HCM implementations and we expect our Next Gen HCM sales to contribute in a more meaningful way to our bookings growth in fiscal 2024. Outside the U.S., we intend to scale our iHCM midmarket platform in fiscal 2024, adding at least 1,000 clients over the course of the year. I am also incredibly excited to share that we will begin offering role outside the U.S. in fiscal 2024 to drive incremental growth. We plan to launch initially in two countries in Europe and expand its reach from there. And we intend to continue growing our Asia-Pacific business in part by leveraging our recent acquisition of a strong midmarket time product to supplement our existing payroll functionality. And across a few of our platforms, including Workforce Now and Roll, we intend to deploy GenAI-powered features to help our clients more quickly and easily tackle certain HR transactions. Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing to our clients. We pride ourselves on serving as a true partner to each and every one of our one million clients. Our culture of client service applies equally across our entire business from a basic payroll client to a fully outsourced client where we run part or all of the HR department. Our expertise and partnership approach has been key to ADP's winning formula for decades, and we will continue to lean into it. We expect that to manifest in a few ways in fiscal 2024. We have recently been piloting a number of tools powered by GenAI that can help our service and implementation associates deliver an even better client experience, and we will begin deploying these more broadly in early fiscal 2024. Given the significant number of clients we onboard and interact with every year, we expect to learn quite a bit this year about the longer-term benefits we and our clients might realize from GenAI. Meanwhile, demand for our HR outsourcing solutions remains very strong, and in fiscal 2024, we are focused on reaching new clients and further improving the experience for existing ones. Our Employer Services HRO businesses have been performing incredibly well and our focus for fiscal 2024 is to continue delivering strong bookings and keep client satisfaction and retention at current levels or perhaps even reach new record levels. And our focus for our PEO business in fiscal 2024 is to maintain our recent strong bookings momentum by continuing to add to our sales force headcount, grow our referral partner network and use data and machine learning to identify existing ADP clients who maybe a strong fit for an upgrade. Our third and final strategic priority is to leverage our global scale for the benefit of our clients. Our size and scale are unmatched in the industry. Across the globe, we not only offer robust platforms and a commitment to industry-leading service and expertise, but we also provide a scaled ecosystem and a unique on-the-ground presence in over 30 countries. This combination positions us to interact routinely with local governments and tax authorities, meet stringent certification and data requirements, and stay on top of complex and shifting legal requirements. Globally, we bring together our incredible data, an array of partners and integrated solutions, and one of the biggest and best business-to-business sales forces in the world to help our clients and prospects navigate the changing world of work. In fiscal 2024, we will continue to build on that scale for the benefit of our clients. Our GlobalView platform support hundreds of the world's largest multi-national companies with scaled workforces in over 40 countries and our Celergo platform helps us serve thousands more in up to 140 countries. In fiscal 2024, we expect to expand on both as we add additional countries to GlobalView's broad reach and as we potentially make tuck-in acquisitions to enhance our native in-country footprint. After establishing an ADP in-country presence in five new markets in 2023, we expect to expand further in fiscal 2024. Our world-class global scale distribution led by over 8,500 sellers is being supported by headcount and marketing investments in 2024, and as we've shared with you in the past few quarters, our sellers will continue to be paired with a best-in-class sales tech stack, which we plan to enhance with GenAI functionality in the coming months. And our ability to provide data-driven insights will continue to grow in fiscal 2024. ADP serves more clients and pays more people around the world than ever, and as we continue growing the number of employees we serve globally, the power of our insights will likewise continue to increase and benefit our clients. I am incredibly excited about these three strategic priorities for ADP and the differentiation and growth they will continue to drive. But before turning it over to Don, I wanted to take a moment to recognize our associates for their effort and performance over the course of this year. Our associates embody our core values, like insightful expertise, service excellence, and being results-driven. In fiscal 2023, ADP was recognized as the World's Most Admired Company by Fortune Magazine for the 17th consecutive year, signifying the incredibly strong culture we have and the important role we play in the world. Additionally, we were recently recognized, for the first time, as one of the Best Companies for Innovators by Fast Company, a true testament to the direction we are headed in. We owe these accolades as well as our strong consistent financial performance to the commitment and effort of our 63,000 associates that make-up the ADP family. With that, I'll turn it over to Don. Yes, fair enough. Thanks, Samad, and I appreciate the congratulations on the quarter and the year. We're, obviously, pretty proud over here. So with respect to Roll, it is exciting. It's been an exciting product for us to rollout, no pun intended, across the down-market here in the U.S. We're excited to take it into international. As mentioned, the initial goal is to put it into two countries. And it is an incremental add for us because it's really initially into these two countries. We're thinking more kind of the down-market SMB space, which is an area of opportunity for us across many of the markets that we serve. But we're also excited about Roll long-term beyond that space. So excited to dip it into our international space as we continue the overall rollout of Roll. In terms of factoring it into the overall bookings, not really. I think the - by the time the launch happens and as we're thinking about the full year for our international business or full year for new business bookings, I'd be surprised if it ultimately makes a dent, but to us, it's really about the long-term value that that offer will bring as we seek to expand the addressable market for us into these various places. Last but not least, Samad, you mentioned the complexity of being international. And I have to tell you, I spoke to it a little bit in the prepared remarks. There's a lot that goes into being in each one of these countries. To your point, there is complexity country-by-country. Many countries put many of the states that are complex here in the U.S. to shame in terms of the complexity that provides, and that's everything from government entities, legal and tax attorneys, who's the tax authority and how do you get to them. We often think of it as an ecosystem. We think about it as kind of that final mile, if you will, and that's the complexity and that's what we've been building over the last couple of decades in our international business. So it's a lot more than dropping off software at a country border and hoping that it works. There's a lot to be said for the ecosystem around it. Again, whether it's tax authorities, data lodgement, things of that nature. So excited to take advantage of the footprint we've built and put in our product into that footprint as we expand Roll internationally. That's right. My only add to that comment would be, we stepped into the quarter with healthy pipelines, with a strong staffing position that was growing tenure. I have to tell you when I reflect on all the quarters that I've watched across our sales execution, generally speaking, you have a bunch of businesses that are outperforming and you have a few businesses that are perhaps being carried by those that are outperforming. What I have to tell you is, this was a broad-based strength across the entire organization sales implementation service with kind of an all-hands-on-deck execution, and that's really what it's all about. What I would attribute it to is incredible execution. Good morning, Bryan. So I'll comment on both. The mid-market strength that we've seen and coming in a bit better than expected. It's been solid for quite some time. That's inclusive of our HRO offerings, and as you know, we've been speaking to those quite a bit in terms of the resonance of that value proposition in the market. So I think that adds to the overall strength that we have in the mid-market, which is the various flavors and offers that we have. I think the other is that we've made tremendous investments into that business. So we do have our next-generation payroll engine that the sales force is pretty excited about and we're seeing that in the wins that are coming in and just kind of the momentum there. I think the other is the amount of product investment and innovation that we've done in the mid-market, specifically referencing the investments we've made into the Workforce Now platform with the new UX and many of the things that I've been speaking to. And I think the other call out is it definitely helps on a new business bookings perspective, when the business on the other side, so service and NPS, if you will, as well as retention are firing on all cylinders. And that's exactly the case. We have record retention in our mid-market, and we have near-record MPS results across the mid-market. So really, really proud of the execution in that entire space. And that definitely fuels and feeds the ability for our sellers to get excited about everything that I just mentioned to go-to-market. Stepping into the question around next-gen HCM, I did make a reference to that. We've talked a lot over the last quarters about this year. And what we've been working on is scaling implementation, and that's exactly what we've done in that business. So, we were able to onboard a lot of the clients, that we had on our backlog. We've shortened the time of implementation, and we also saw additions to that backlog. So, we saw new sales in the fourth quarter of that next-generation HCM platform. We're really excited about the momentum as we step into '24. And as such, we believe that Next Gen HCM will be a larger contributor to bookings for us in the upcoming years than it was in '23, but we were pleased with what we saw in the fourth quarter and the momentum heading in. So, I think both of your questions, I just want to confirm, I'm hearing them the right way. I think they both kind of speak to the general sentiment around the demand environment. Is that kind of a good way to think about it in terms of decisions getting delayed and/or what's the appetite to, I suppose, by HCM in the current macro environment. And so, I'll comment on the general demand environment and feel free to follow-up with an additional question if I didn't cover what you wanted. But the way that I think about demand, and I've spoken to it quite a bit over the last couple of quarters. Demand remains strong, and that is very broad-based across the business. And so, if you think about the down market, you still have the strength of small business formations. You have the strength of hiring that's happening in the down market. And as such you have clients there needing to make decisions around our HCM offers in that space, right? So that's definitely a place that we've been winning, and we'll continue to lean in as warranted by the demand. The mid-market, as we talked about that a little bit earlier in terms of the overall demand there for the complexity that exists in that market. That's inclusive again of the solution we have around our HR outsourcing offerings. And so that's kind of the mid-market. So getting to your question, which is really about the enterprise space and perhaps even the MNC space, it is an area that we continue to watch as it relates to demand cycles, decision delays. And the main reason is those are really the places that you, as you're aware, have additional, perhaps signers, additional levels of approval, things of that nature. And what I would say, which is consistent with what we've been seeing, is that we are back to pre-pandemic levels. So deal cycles did shorten during the pandemic, and they elongated back the pre-pandemic. But it isn't something that we're seeing additional elongation beyond historical averages. And so to your point, though, it is an area that we consistently watch both in the enterprise space as well as in our international business, just to kind of see if the demand cycle is at the client's appetite to make buying decisions or implementation decisions during this time has changed thus far, we're not seeing it in a broad-based way. But it is an area we continue to monitor. Sure. And thank you, Mark. I appreciate the congratulations. So, I am very excited about the strategic priorities, as I outlined during the prepared remarks. I don't know that I was necessarily expecting to have to pick a favorite pillar or a - one that I expect to yield impact faster than another because I think broadly speaking, they apply across all of ADP, and they will depend a bit as it relates to kind of each business, right? And so, when I think about some of the product investments that we're making. Some of the things, the work that we've done and the impact, whether it's taking a product like roll internationally, which I mentioned earlier, will be short-term results, but some of the impact of continuing to build on the momentum we have in the mid-market with our next-generation payroll engine, as an example, where we have an ability to win differently, we see competitive advantages and differentiation there. I think that's an area that can have tremendous impact in short order. I think the other is Don did it first, which is he mentioned the likes of generative AI. And when I think about that, the Gen AI and applying it broadly across these pillars, I think there is opportunity for us in product that's pretty tremendous, whether it's solving real opportunities for our clients to become more efficient. We've talked a lot about that, whether that's things like job descriptions, performance reviews, things of that nature. But it also leads me kind of to that second pillar to your point around what will come short-term versus long-term. I think there's opportunity in the short-term that will make impact as well as the long-term, in terms of really applying generative AI across our expertise that we provide to our clients. And so, when I think about our ability to make it easier for our clients to engage with us or our associates to engage with our clients, some of the tools that - we have already deployed across various businesses and will further deploy into fiscal '24, such as - think of it almost as a copilot agent assist where we're helping our agents be more efficient. That's going to yield short-term results, if nothing else in client satisfaction. And again, we know happy clients lead to a longer staying clients that leads to more sales and the wheel, if you will. So, I think there are opportunities across all of the strategic priorities to have some impact us sooner than the long-term. But yes, I'm equally excited about all of them. And certainly, we spoke quite a bit about the global piece. In terms of the next-generation time engine, that is being developed in tandem with our next-generation payroll engine. And those two things are really about time and payroll sitting together in our mid-market. It is a based on the same backbone of technology. And so, we're very excited to take that more broadly across the mid-market as we continue to take the next generation payroll engine also more broadly crossed. And I think, both of those things will get feathered into the impact of our win rates, if you will, and our new business bookings in the mid-market throughout the course of '24. Sure. Good morning, Eugene. PEO bookings, again, we're incredibly pleased with the results in the fourth quarter and the reacceleration. We also did see the reacceleration in the third quarter. So the back half of the PEO was exactly as you suggested. It was a lot of focus for the management team, and I'm really excited about how we came together to execute. And in terms of the overall demand trends in long-term, short term. I remain bullish on the overall value proposition of the PEO and the demand that it warrants. It's hard in that business to kind of pin down the demand trends, because there are so many variables. And in the PEO, it's not as simple as looking at just leads and number of request for proposals that are coming in, because as you know, not every client as a potential fits. So it's a little a little difficult to pin down kind of the various demand trends in the specificity outside of the overall belief in the demand environment. And there's a normal level of kind of variability as it relates to PEO bookings quarter-to-quarter, which also makes it hard to kind of spot various trends. Some of that has to do with the calendar year-end. Some of that has to do with when renewals happen. But nonetheless, there was a tremendous amount of focus and still remains. We remain very focused as a team across all of the leadership to make sure that we continue to drive the strong growth in bookings in the PEO in '24. Yes. And so said differently, the good news is we just went through our strategic plan process in the last six months. And so, we had all of our priority sequence in all of our investments and incremental investments lined up. As we marry that to Gen AI, we have a very clear lens on where some projects may get enhanced and where some projects may look different and perhaps get replaced by a new way of thinking about it. And so candidly speaking, we're going through a lot of these opportunities at this juncture kind of thinking through the bets and there will be incremental investment. And there will be other investments that we repurposed to go do some of these things - in a new way. So, the answer is both. Thank you. Sure. You started with a question on international. So is the rest of your question about international or is it just in general? About international. Yes. So, we have been, over the years, been making in-country decisions on investments. I talked a lot about the, call it, the feet on the street, the final mile of infrastructure that we have to support our international business. And so, we will continue to do that. That's inclusive of each year. We go into new markets and some of those are organic ways that we go into new markets. Some of those are actually partners that we ultimately end up at some point, call it, purchasing, if you will, or acquiring. And so, the answer is both organic and inorganic. That's kind of how we've built the business over the last 20 years. And we will continue where warranted to think about it both ways. And the decision criteria for us is really about speed. A lot of times, it's our clients that pulled us into incremental markets. When I think about the five markets that we went into this year or the two countries that we're heading into with global view, they're byproduct of clients that are choosing to pay employees in certain markets. And as such, for us, a lot of times the decision we make on how to get there, has a lot to do with speed. And as such, again, we will leverage both organic and inorganic ways to get there. So, I don't know, Don, you ran our international business for a very long time. I don't know if you want to add anything. Yes, fair. It's a fair observation, James. Appreciate it. I think the we thought about - by the way, I wish I knew the answer, right? So the question you're asking which is how much conservatism is in there? And that's all to say and you hit the nail on the head, we set into this year guiding minus 25 to 50, we're stepping into fiscal '24 with a guide of minus 50 to 70 - and we hope - I'll end - or I'll start with, we're very happy with where things are. We're firing on all cylinders. We have many businesses that have record MPS results, record retention results and everything is good. And so as we step into the year, the way that we are modeling what you would see in pays per control. The way we're thinking about the potential macroeconomic tempering, if you will, specifically in the back half, is really a byproduct of how we see retention. Part of what we saw in the fourth quarter that led to the incredible results that we had was that the normalization that we've been seeing in the down-market, we did actually see the down market bounce a little bit. So even while it was down year-on-year, it came in stronger than we expected. And so we do anticipate that we may need to give some of that back, which is why we believe it was prudent to align our retention targets through our medium-term targets that we gave back in the Investor Day of 2021. So I wish I knew the answer to your question in terms of how much conservatism, why we are guiding to what we're guiding is really about the economic outlook, whether that's GDP, unemployment is still at record lows. We haven't seen unemployment rates that low since the 60s. And so our guess is as good as yours at some level, but we did build in some tempering of the economy in the back half, and that's really what's yielding that guide on the retention. The PEO has a tremendous value proposition. I think we always refer to ADP as an all-weather company. I would say the most durable of our all-weather businesses is the PEO. And a lot of that has to do with the ability to flex that value proposition in a downturn pretty quickly. So if you think about clients that are growing, they enjoy the PEO because it's a quick go-to-market. On the downside, if you will, as clients are potentially trying to work through economic headwinds, the PEO serves as a place that has a clear return on investment, has a total cost of ownership that's very again, very clear. And so I think it's a business that not to suggest that it's not impacted by a downturn, but it's a business that kind of works in both. What I would say is our sales force, we're able to pivot that narrative and that value proposition as warranted. I don't believe that has happened. So to answer the question, our clients at this point, hesitant to purchase something such as the PEO that's so comprehensive because of the macroeconomic challenges. And my view would be, no. I think that's substantiated by the record results that we had in the PEO bookings in the quarter. We also saw that strength in bookings in the third quarter. So I think that value proposition is holding firm. And I think it's a business that should - should the economic wins ever come to life that we've been expecting for so long. It's a business that can pivot pretty quickly and the demand for the offer remains. Thank you, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. As you've heard, Don and I, the entire leadership team we're incredibly pleased with fiscal '23, specifically the fourth quarter and the finish. So I'll kind of end where I started, which is, I want to take the opportunity to once again thank the associates that create this performance. It's an unbelievable magical thing to watch it all come together and deliver what we just delivered. And so my gratitude and I celebrate each and every one of them. I also want to thank all of the stakeholders, including all of you who listen today, appreciate the support. We're certainly excited for fiscal '24. So cheers to that."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Don McGuire",
            "content": "Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by expanding on Maria's comments around our Q4 results and then cover our fiscal 2024 financial outlook. Q4 performance is very strong overall, driving fiscal '23 results at or above our expectations. As Maria mentioned, these results reflected broad-based strength in Employer Services and PEO new business bookings, better-than-anticipated Employer Services retention and continued healthy Employer Services pays per control growth, yielding 10% organic constant currency revenue growth for the year and bringing us to $18 billion in revenue. For our Employer Services segment, revenue in the quarter increased 11% on both the reported and organic constant currency basis. This stronger-than-expected revenue growth was a function of continued outperformance in retention and pays per control growth as well as a better-than-anticipated contribution from client funds interest. Our ES margin expanded 480 basis points in the fourth quarter, which was broadly in line with our expectations. For the full year, our ES revenue grew 10% on a reported basis and 11% on an organic constant currency basis, and our ES margin expanded 190 basis points. Growth in client funds interest helped us in a year in which we added a fair amount to our product, service, and sales headcount, which has driven some fairly substantial benefits in sales, Net Promoter Score, and retention results. For our PEO, revenue increased 4% for the quarter, decelerating slightly from Q3, as we anticipated. Average worksite employees increased 3% on a year-over-year basis to 722,000, and has started to gradually reaccelerate, supported by very strong bookings growth in Q4. PEO margin contracted 110 basis points in the fourth quarter, in line with our expectations due in part to higher selling expenses. For the full year, our PEO revenue grew 8% and average worksite employees increased 6% and our margin expanded 60 basis points, all in line with our most recent guidance. I'll now turn to our outlook for fiscal '24. While the economic backdrop remains uncertain, we continue to believe we are well-positioned to deliver solid overall financial results, while also investing for future growth, consistent with the strategic priorities that Maria laid out. Our fiscal '24 outlook assumes a moderation in economic activity over the course of the year, but nothing dramatic. Beginning with ES segment revenue, we expect growth of 7% to 8% driven by the following key assumptions. We expect ES new business bookings growth of 4% to 7%, representing a solid growth after a particularly strong fiscal '23. For now, we're assuming a stronger first half and some moderation in second half bookings growth, which we think is prudent, given the limited visibility into the macro environment. For ES retention, we finished fiscal '23 at a record level of 92.2%, consistently outperforming our expectations throughout the year. We are, of course, very pleased with this performance as we overcame headwinds from higher down-market out of business levels with strength elsewhere. With that said, we are contemplating a 50 to 70 basis points ES retention decline for fiscal '24, due in part to an assumption that small business losses will increase slightly from where they are today as well as an assumption for general impact to our other businesses from a slowing economic backdrop. As we called out three months ago, we see the potential for below normal pays per control growth in fiscal '24 and our outlook assumes 1% to 2% growth for the year. We had a strong Q4, which gives us a solid starting point for growth and a gradual deceleration over the course of the year feels reasonable at this time. And after price contributed 150 basis points to our ES revenue growth in fiscal '23, we are anticipating a smaller contribution in fiscal '24, though still above our recent historical average contribution of around 50 basis points. And for client funds interest revenue, the interest rate backdrop has been dynamic these past few months, and is important to keep in mind that our client funds interest revenue forecast reflects the current forward yield curve, which will, of course, evolve as we move through fiscal '24. At this point, we expect our average yield to increase from 2.4% in fiscal '23 to 2.8% in fiscal '24. We, meanwhile, expect our average client funds balances to grow 2% to 3% in fiscal '24, this is a bit lower than recent trends, due primarily to more modest contribution from pays per control growth and an assumption for more moderate wage increases. Putting those together, we expect our client funds interest revenue to increase from $813 million in fiscal '23 to a range of $955 million to $975 million in fiscal '24. Meanwhile, we expect the net impact from our client fund strategy to increase from $730 million in fiscal '23 to a range of $815 million to $835 million in fiscal '24. For our ES margin, we expect an increase of 130 to 150 basis points, driven by operating leverage and contribution from client funds interest revenue, offset by continued investments across our strategic priorities. Moving on to the PEO segment. We expect PEO revenue and PEO revenue, excluding zero margin pass-through, to grow 3% to 5% in fiscal '24. The primary driver for our PEO revenue growth is our outlook for average worksite employee growth of 3% to 4%. This represents a gradual reacceleration from the 3% growth we're stepping off in Q4. Strong bookings performance has already contributed to accelerating client growth, but that has so far been offset by slowing pays per control growth. With continued strong bookings growth, our worksite employee growth should gradually accelerate as well. And as Maria shared, demand has been healthy and we remain confident in the long-term growth opportunity in PEO. We expect PEO margin to be down between 20 and 40 basis points in fiscal '24, due to anticipated higher selling expenses, as well as year-over-year headwind from a lower workers' compensation reserve release benefit than we experienced in fiscal '23. Adding it all up, our consolidated revenue outlook is for 6% to 7% growth in fiscal '24 and our adjusted EBIT margin outlook is for expansion of 60 to 80 basis points. We expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '24 to be around 23%. And we expect adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12%, supported by buybacks. One quick note on cadence. At this point, we expect total revenue growth to be relatively consistent quarter-to-quarter. We expect our adjusted EBIT margin to be down slightly in Q1 on a year-over-year basis, and then build over the course of the year. Thank you, and I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Hi, Owen, thanks. Yes, I'll answer the question. We had a very, very strong sales bookings result in Q4. So we're very happy with that, and we've seen the sales reaccelerate. I think as we said in the prepared comments, we are seeing continued growth in clients. I think if there is a challenge that we're facing a little bit as we're seeing a little bit softer pays per control growth in the PEO than we would have expected. But back to what we've been saying for some time, we think the underlying value proposition is very, very strong and we look to that business continue to grow for us and be a big part of our portfolio. Yes, thanks for the question. I'll start here and I think I'll turn over to Maria for the bookings. But we certainly saw strength across the Board. I think once again, in the prepared remarks, we called out the - our tax business and our international business. So they were very strong amongst all the ones that were strong and the down-market was also quite strong. So it was really a contribution from across the Board in the fourth quarter. We talked for some time about how the pipelines are healthy and whatnot, and you had questions before about times to get signatures on deals, et cetera, things came together in the fourth quarter and we were very, very pleased with the final result. Yes. So, we were happy with our price increase and retention. So as we've talked to many times, we want to make sure that we're not getting greedy. So, we did get about 150 basis points of price in the year. And we did that without the expense of seeing a decline in retention or NPS scores. And quite frankly, those NPS scores have stayed healthy despite the price increase. So as much as price increases can land well, they have landed well, and we're very happy with how that transpired throughout '23. For '24, we do expect to have price increases again. We do not think that we're going to be in the 150 basis point range. We're certainly going to be above our historical average of about 50 basis points. But once again, we'll watch closely and make sure that the underlying value proposition for our clients stays in place, and we'll take some price for sure, but not to the extent that we did in FY '23. Yes. I think we have a number of projects that we've shared with you all over the past number of quarters. Those projects are well underway. We won't take a lot of time talking about specific Gen AI product projects, but I guess that would be a place that would anticipate I'll get a question we'll get a question for that later on in this call, given it's so topical. But generally, we're continuing our direction with the investments that we've described over the past number of quarters, and we continue to make good progress. We continue to have good delivery. The ability to take RUN to markets in Europe is an example of that, how investments in that development in that technology has increased. And by the way, that's part of our broader strategy that we've touched on many times, is to take some of these developments and make sure that they're global in nature as opposed to only local in nature. So nothing incredibly new, just a continuation of the great work and the great projects we have underway. Yes, Mark, thanks for the question. We're not looking at a big change in the first quarter, but just a couple of the drivers. Just to be clear. One, we do have some incremental investment in cost and headcount, et cetera. But the other big driver in the first quarter is it's a big borrowing quarter for us in our laddered client fund interest strategy. So that's going to put a little bit of pressure on the margin for the fourth - sorry, for the first quarter. And the margin will continue to build over the course of the year, and we will get the overall improvement that we expected, but more out of the three quarters as opposed to the first. Yes. So thanks for the question. Let me start by what won't change. So what won't change is that we'll continue to make sure that we invest in key areas of the business to make sure that we can run it effectively. And with the strong bookings, we'll make sure that we have the people on the ground for implementation to get those deals up and running and generating revenue for us, et cetera. But in the last year, we did have pretty substantial growth in, over the last couple of years coming out of the pandemic. I can't believe we're still talking about the pandemic. But as we came out of the pandemic, we did have substantial growth in expenses in service, implementation, sales, et cetera. And while we do continue to expect to see some growth, we're not going to see as much growth in expenses in those areas. So that would be one of the areas that is going to make sure and you hit on it with respect to OpEx. We're not going to see the growth in OpEx expense that we saw in the prior year. The other contributor, of course, that will continue to contribute. I think, the yield curve is more favorable than it was the last time I spoke to you all. We will get contribution from client fund interest next year. But at the same time, it's not going to be to the extent that we did in '23. So that's also going to help with driving margins higher. But once again, not the same tailwind - tailwinds that we had in '23. I think those are the main items that are going to help us improve our margins going into next year. Yes. So, I think revenue growth is going to be - revenue growth is going to be pretty consistent throughout the year as we start the - as we start that big backlog that we now have as a result of that very, very strong fourth quarter bookings result. So, we will see consistency there. Likewise with PEO, it's going to be a bit of a slower burn as we did have strong sales in Q4. So, we did also talk about slightly lower pace control growth in the PEO business. So - but I don't think they're really going to be that different. I think, they're going to be pretty close if you think about the overall growth, and consolidate the results for the company not substantially different between the business units. Yes, maybe just to add, I think what we've been doing, Peter, over the last number of years is we have done a number of acquisitions. They've been mostly tuck-ins, but we did have three interesting ones over the last year. We acquired an Italian company that has a good budget payroll - budgeting software tool that's very prominent in the Italian market. We acquired our - so it streamlines [indiscernible] partner in South Africa. And we also want a very exciting mid-market time-and-attendance product called SecureX in out of Bangalore in India. So - and that product is available in India, most of Southeast Asia and the Middle East. So, I think that's a demonstration of what we've been doing, we've been looking at and focused on to continue to make sure we grow that footprint, and we do think it continues to be an exciting space for us. Yes. So I think as those - investments mature, you're going to see those investments reinvested at higher rates, and we do expect to see our average return go up over the course of the year. The current reinvestment schedules, overnights are reinvesting at 5%. The extended in the loan portfolios are being reinvested at about 4%.We don't expect to see a huge change in the mix. Although the average duration of our investments has shortened a little bit over the last couple of years. But you can pretty much look at those yields, look at the maturity schedule that we provided and then look at the composition of our portfolio across the overnight, the extended and the long and pretty much come to a conclusion or come to some numbers on where you think we're going to end up. Yes. We've had this question a few times, and - the answer is we've been very successful with the strategy that we've had for the last 20 years. We certainly see that there is an opportunity cost not ever having everything in short today. At the same time, we do believe that the yield curve will normalize and the strategy we've had in place will come back and be beneficial to us over the longer term. So you shouldn't expect any significant change in our investment strategy. Yes, James. So in terms of what we're targeting, what we're talking about, there's always things kicking around, of course, but we want to make sure that anything that we do acquire either fits well in the core and gives us additional capability, or it's something that really exceeds some functionality capability that we currently have, so that we're not stacking on more and more product on top of what we already have. The other area, of course, is to make sure that - we do things that are natural adjacencies - are very strong adjacencies to what we already do so that they fit well. And then thirdly, of course, is making sure that we can sell these things and run these things in a recurring model, so that we can sell them the way we sell everything else we sell today and operate them and expect to get revenue anticipation and good model from what we buy. So I think those are the things we think about. I think we're hearing a lot around valuations coming down in the press, certainly a little bit of a dearth of activity, if you will, in the M&A space these days. But we do have lots of conversations about acquisitions and whatnot. I still think, of course, everybody is looking to get a premium what they have. And we're trying to make sure that if we're going to buy something, we're paying the right price. But we don't actually get to the point of many of these conversations given the conditions that I stated at the front at the outset to actually have a view on overall valuations in the market. We likely get to talking about valuation in a very, very few number of cases. Remembering, of course, very, very few of the opportunities we get even get to that conversation. So I don't think I can say we have a general view. But we are focused on what we would have to pay and how things would fit into ADP. No. We're certainly not anticipating this as you go negative. We do, though, think it's going to go to somewhere ever 1% to 2%, which is a little bit less than our historical average. However, I just want to make sure that everybody understands, we're exiting the year pretty healthily. So we figure we're off to a pretty good start, but we do expect that we're going to see a bit of a decline over the next three, four quarters. And once again, we're aligning ourselves to the best we can with unemployment forecasts and et cetera."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danny Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanny Hussain: Thank you, Michelle and welcome everyone to ADP\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC\u2019s website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today\u2019s call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today\u2019s call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risks. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I will now turn it over to Maria.\nMaria Black: Thank you, Danny and thank you everyone for joining us. For our third quarter, we delivered strong results, including 10% organic constant currency revenue growth, 110 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion and 14% adjusted EPS growth. Our continued solid financial performance underscores the power of our innovative and mission-critical HCM solutions that serve over 1 million diverse clients around the world as well as our highly recurring revenue business model. As usual, I will start with some highlights from the quarter. The demand environment was healthy overall. And in Q3, we drove another quarter of solid Employer Services, new business bookings growth, representing a record Q3 bookings amount. Bookings performance continues to be particularly strong in our downmarket portfolio. In Q3, we sold and started over 60,000 new run clients, where a new user experience has helped us reach record level new client satisfaction rates these past few quarters. We also had strong bookings results in our insurance and retirement services offerings supported not only by legislative tailwinds, but also by the competitive positioning of our downmarket HCM ecosystem. Demand for our employer services HR outsourcing solutions remained high and we have recently reached the 10,000 client mark. We also saw continued booking strength in our compliance-oriented solutions, including tax remittance and wage payments, which have always been key differentiators for us. On a year-to-date basis, we are within our bookings guidance range and are trending in line with our expectations from the outset of the year and we look forward to finishing the year with a strong close. Our employer services retention rate came in better than expected once again. While we continue to experience normalization in our downmarket out of business rates, this was offset by the strong retention rates in our U.S. mid-market and international businesses, both of which continue to benefit from years of improving client satisfaction. As such, we are pleased to be raising our full year retention guidance. Our employer services paid for control grew 4% for the quarter and continues to decelerate at a very gradual pace. As we have seen for several quarters now, layoffs at many larger companies have been offset by the labor demand elsewhere, which in total has resulted in year-over-year employment growth. With this continued resilience, we are pleased to expect the higher end of our previous pays per control guidance range. Last, on our PEO, while growth in revenue and average works on employees continued to decelerate this quarter, we were pleased to see PEO bookings growth reaccelerate nicely in Q3, especially in March. This represented a much better performance than we experienced in Q2 and resulted in our largest quarter for PEO bookings ever. Despite the current inflationary environment and broad-based macroeconomic uncertainty, we are focused on our PEO sales execution and on delivering continued strong client satisfaction and we remain confident in the long-term secular growth opportunity. Stepping back, while we are pleased to be on track to deliver very strong full year financial results, we are even more excited about how we are leveraging our unmatched scale and decades of innovation experience to drive continued progress on our important modernization journey. We are making our solutions more powerful and easier to use and we are making our unparalleled insight and expertise more accessible than ever. In doing all this, we are delivering an experience that\u2019s better for our clients, better for their employees and better for ADP. I mentioned the tens of thousands of new clients we onboarded in our downmarket, over a third of those clients utilized our digital onboarding experience, yielding a faster time to start, happier clients and greater productivity for our implementation team. We just completed our busy year-end period during which we helped our clients with over 75 million U.S. tax forms and to further enhance the client experience, we proactively service critical year-end data to our clients before they had to search for it. This not only reduced friction for them, but also reduced the number of calls and interactions with our service teams. For years, we have directly engaged and served our clients\u2019 employees through channels like Wisely. As we focus on the overall employee experience we can offer, we continue to add valuable functionality like a savings envelope that employees have used to move more than $1 billion into savings over the last 12 months and a new financial wellness hub with tips, tools and education to drive better financial outcomes. With our new intelligent self-service solution, we are already interacting with over 3 million client employees per month through our action card feature. And our voice of employee solution is helping thousands of clients obtain better insights from their employee population, which can drive higher engagement and satisfaction for those employees. The opportunity to continue creating value and efficiency in the world of work is meaningful and we believe these modern approaches that reduce friction and exceed client expectations will help us deliver on that in the coming years. With that in mind, I want to provide some perspective on how we are strategically positioning ourselves to invest over the near-term given the economic backdrop. As we shared earlier this year, in fiscal 2023, we were impacted by higher wage inflation. We also added to our service and implementation capacity to meet the expectations of our growing client base and we invested throughout the year in sales and product. As we position for potential economic slowdown beyond this fiscal year, we are being thoughtful about how we prioritize our investments. At the same time, we are very much committed to our ongoing modernization journey, which is critical to our sustainable growth and that will require continued steady reinvestment into the business. In the coming quarters, I look forward to updating you on near-term growth priorities for ADP. Before turning it over to Don, I want to take a moment to recognize our associates for their continued focus on helping our clients through the many challenges they face each day, especially amid these uncertain times. Resiliency and partnerships represent core components of the ADP brand promise and are among the many reasons businesses around the world choose to partner with a leader in the industry. Our unrelenting support through years of growth, years of challenge and the years in between is something they have grown to count on and we are honored to support them. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Don.\nDon McGuire: Thank you, Maria and good morning everyone. I will provide some more details on our Q3 results and update you on our fiscal \u201823 outlook before briefly touching on fiscal \u201824. Let me jump straight into the segments, starting with Employer Services. ES segment revenue increased 11% on a reported basis and 12% on an organic constant currency basis, which is the strongest ES revenue growth we have experienced in quite some time. As Maria shared, ES new business bookings were solid and kept us on track with our full year outlook. We believe the full range of bookings outcomes is still on the table given the relative importance of Q4 bookings to our full year results. So we are not making any change to our guidance, but we do believe the middle of our guidance range feels most likely at this point. On ES retention, following another quarter of better-than-expected results, we are again revising our outlook and we now expect retention to be down only 10 to 20 basis points for the full year compared to our prior outlook of down 20 to 30 basis points. This again will be driven by retention decline in our down market from normalized out-of-business losses and is mostly offset by improved overall retention elsewhere. Pays per control remained strong in Q3 and we are raising our outlook to now assume about 4% pays per control growth for the year compared to our prior outlook for 3% to 4% growth. Client funds interest revenue increased in Q3 in line with our expectations and we are updating our full year outlook utilizing the latest forward yield curve, which in this case resulted in no major change. And on FX, we had about 1 percentage point of ES revenue headwinds in Q3 and there is no change to our outlook for a full year headwind of between 1% and 2%. Following our strong Q3 ES revenue growth, we are pleased to be raising our outlook once again to now expect about 9% growth, up from 8% to 9% before. Our ES margin increased 80 basis points in Q3, which was in line with our expectations. We are narrowing our full year outlook to now expect about 200 basis points of margin expansion and we still see significant opportunity to invest in sales, product and elsewhere throughout the organization to capitalize on the growth opportunity in front of us, which we are choosing to do at this juncture. Moving on to the PEO, we had 5% revenue growth driven by 3% growth in average works on employees. As a reminder, this deceleration is driven by a few factors, including slow pays per control growth, difficult comparisons versus record retention levels and softer recent bookings growth that we experienced the last 2 years. For this fiscal year, we now expect PEO revenue growth of about 8% with growth in average works on employees of about 6%, both at the lower end of our prior ranges. Maria mentioned the bookings reacceleration in Q3 and we are feeling upbeat about reaccelerating the revenue growth in the coming several quarters. This guidance update is mainly due to a tweak to our pays per control assumption within the PEO as it decelerated a bit more than we previously assumed, somewhat different from what we experienced in the ES segment. We are separately lowering our outlook for revenue, excluding zero margin pass-throughs to a range of 7% to 8% due mainly to lower SUI rates in Q3 than we previously anticipated. PEO margin increased 140 basis points in Q3, which was better than expected due primarily to continued favorable workers\u2019 compensation reserve adjustments, which we had not assumed as well as the lower SUI costs I just mentioned and we are raising our outlook for PEO margin to now expect it to be up 50 to 75 basis points for fiscal \u201823. Putting it altogether, we still expect consolidated revenue growth of 8% to 9% in fiscal \u201823, but now believe it will be towards the higher end of that range. We are maintaining our outlook for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 125 to 150 basis points and for a fiscal \u201823 effective tax rate of about 23%. And we now expect adjusted EPS growth of 16% to 17% and compared to our prior outlook of 15% to 17%. I also want to provide some early high level color on what to expect for next year. We are still going through our annual planning process, but there are a few things to consider at this point. First, assuming a slowing economic backdrop, pays per control could be at a below normal growth rate next year, among other potential macro considerations. I would also point out that while client funds interest appears positioned to give us some contribution to growth, based on the latest forward yield curve, it will likely be very modest. At the same time, we have good momentum in our ES bookings performance and ES retention and we are feeling upbeat about the continued opportunity to build on our decades of success. Thank you. And I\u2019ll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, all. Good morning. Thank you. So Don, maybe just building on those last comments you had there, I am curious just any indications or call-outs worth mentioning as it relates to fiscal \u201824? Really in the context of the medium-term outlook that you have given in the past, just how should the Street consider the magnitude of potential impacts across some of these KPIs from a potentially slower macro environment?\nDon McGuire: Yes, Brian, good morning. Thank you for the question. It\u2019s still early. We are still in the middle of our planning process. I think we have a lot of things going in our favor sales. We are \u2013 we still have relatively high client fund interest. Pays per control have been good and strong. Bookings continue to be strong as we said earlier. So as we get into \u201824, I think we are going to be in a pretty healthy spot with what we know today. I guess the challenge we all have is trying to guess what\u2019s coming in terms of the broader macro situation. We continue to see strong demand. Retention continues to be pretty good, although it\u2019s normalizing a little bit in the down market as we did expect. But I think things feel pretty good at this juncture. So I am going to have to ask you to bear with us a little bit as we make our way through our plan and we stay tuned to what\u2019s going on in the macro environment even closer as we get forward or closer to our July 1 beginning of the year.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. That\u2019s fair. And just on the PEO, so works on employee view downtick and I think you were down sequentially in average works on employees. Can you just talk about what you are seeing in kind of the pays per control versus the retention aspect in the PEO? And with bookings reaccelerating, how long does the reconnection to improve growth take?\nDon McGuire: So the \u2013 we did have, as you mentioned, we had a particularly strong PEO bookings month in March, which we are optimistic is going to continue and help us as we go forward. Certainly, we are going to have to see how those bookings continue through the balance of the year, trying to anticipate how those are going to actually result in revenue. Things do start relatively quickly in the PEO business, but it\u2019s going to take some time once again to see how that stuff rolls from bookings into revenue. But we are pretty optimistic about how things went in the third quarter, especially with the finish and we do expect to see that reacceleration as quickly as we want to. And by the way, back to your earlier question a little bit, we talked about high single-digit growth in our mid-term view and we won\u2019t be happy if we don\u2019t get something like that.\nMaria Black: Yes. I think, Brian, if I can just comment on the quarter-over-quarter real quick as I think you mentioned the sequential growth Q2 to Q3 and works on employees. That is something that obviously we noticed as well and as Don mentioned, from a medium-term perspective, we are definitely still committed from the medium-term to the works on employee growth that we have guided to for that. However, as it relates to kind of the quarter-over-quarter, we noticed the same thing that you noticed. And obviously, that\u2019s not the ideal situation and we are hopeful that won\u2019t be the case as you look sequentially on the quarter-to-quarter, Q3 to Q4, but also year-on-year. And I think that\u2019s really a byproduct of timing and that timing is really about retention, right. So it\u2019s really about, call it, third quarter retention results, which we have cited before were a bit softer than we expected. And as a result of that, you see the sequential piece to the quarter-on-quarter.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Is that just a function of the type of client within PEO?\nMaria Black: In terms of the type being.\nBryan Bergin: More white collar?\nMaria Black: I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a function of more white collar, I think it\u2019s really a function of some of the feelings that we have post-pandemic as the renewals have really been kind of, call it, rippling through the business of the PEO. So it\u2019s really a byproduct of some of the post-pandemic impact that we saw in the PEO. So it\u2019s really a byproduct of the retention softness that we saw in the first quarter, in the second quarter and then quarter-on-quarter this past quarter. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a byproduct of \u2013 because retention continues, albeit it\u2019s normalizing a bit in the down market. We do have very strong retention in the mid-market. We also have strong retention, albeit tiny bit less than last year in the down market. So I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s a byproduct of the client base or white collar, I think it\u2019s really a byproduct of kind of a post-pandemic environment in the PEO.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess just trying to look at Employer Services, really strong growth in the quarter, 12% organic. If you back into the guidance for fourth quarter, it looks like a little bit of a deceleration. I think you get to something around 8% growth. So just trying to understand the puts and takes there for the fourth quarter guide versus the strong results in the third quarter?\nDon McGuire: Yes, thanks for the question. The biggest impact, I guess, in terms of growth would be we are going to continue to see strong growth from client fund interest in the fourth quarter. But certainly, Q3 is by far the strongest quarter just given the seasonality of tax receipts, etcetera, for us. So I think that would be one of the key drivers. And of course, we did mention as well that we expect to see pays per control growth coming down and softening a little bit, even though a bit higher than we expected to see. Last quarter, it is coming down. It\u2019s certainly starting to moderate.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Got it. And then on the bookings side, although bookings were strong, I think you commented maybe towards the lower end of the range of 6% to 9% and just can you help us maybe think about how bookings will translate into future revenue growth for the employer services? If you can just remind us, just as we get our models set or start thinking about fiscal year \u201824.\nMaria Black: Yes. So I\u2019ll let Don comment on the \u2013 how the bookings kind of relate to the models on the revenue side. But from an overall bookings perspective, what we cited in the prepared remarks is that we do anticipate the middle of the range. So we did keep the range constant. So it\u2019s constant with the outset of the year, it\u2019s also constant with last quarter\u2019s guidance. So we are keeping that 6% to 9% range. We do anticipate at this point, the middle of that range. And we feel pretty confident heading into the fourth quarter when we take a look at how we exited March, but also taking a look at the number of sellers we have, the investments we\u2019ve made into the ecosystem and as those sellers ultimately gain tenure because we\u2019re actually lapping a lot of new hires that we had, if you will, a year ago. So pretty excited as we step in the other part of that. Confidence is really about what we\u2019re seeing as it relates to the overall pipeline. So pipelines are strong. That\u2019s more of a, call it, enterprise and international or large deal type of comment. We\u2019re seeing tremendous activity in the top of the funnel still upmarket. So the down market continues to shine for us, and that\u2019s really supported by what we\u2019re seeing in continued increases in new business formations. We\u2019re also seeing those new business formations generate inbound leads. So we\u2019re seeing good activity on the digital side. So feel confident as we step into the fourth quarter, and then I\u2019ll let Don comment on how the \u2013 ultimately where we land in the fourth quarter and how that translates into revenue for us next year.\nDon McGuire: Yes. So on the modeling side, roughly a 1% change in ES bookings growth impacts us in the $17 million to $20 million annually on revenue growth. So that\u2019s kind of how we think about your models. I think that\u2019s been pretty consistent.\nDanny Hussain: Yes. And Brian, the timing is \u2013 it depends on the business. Obviously, strong performance in the downmarket will impact revenue much more quickly. And if you have strong global view sales at the other end of the extreme, that can take several months to even more than a year, in some cases, to roll in. So, typical rule of thumb for us is a couple of quarters to see the full impact. But of course, the bookings throughout the year have been pretty consistent for us. And so I wouldn\u2019t expect any real callouts from the revenue timing standpoint.\nBryan Keane: Great. Alright, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nEugene Simuni: Hi, guys. Good morning. Maria, I wanted to pick back up on your comments about the break down market. Maybe elaborate on that a little bit, what are the macro factors, your competitive positioning that\u2019s still supporting that? And if you could contrast that for us a little bit with what\u2019s going on in the mid-market. I know it\u2019s still doing well. But if the question is, is there a path for mid-market to get to as strong of a point down market? And what are the levers that maybe you\u2019re able to pull to get you there?\nMaria Black: Absolutely. So I\u2019ll start with the down market, just to kind of reiterate the strength we\u2019re seeing there top of funnel. So we are very pleased with what we saw in the performance of the down market. That\u2019s also inclusive of the down market ecosystem. So I think this is our run platform. I talked about the third quarter onboarding 60,000 clients. It\u2019s pretty incredible. Those clients also, many of them have attach rates of our retirement services offering, our insurance services offering. So the entire down market portfolio it\u2019s definitely performing well for us and has for quite some time. It is driven by what we\u2019re seeing macro. And so you just kind of reiterate what we\u2019ve seen as new business formations are up year-on-year, 8%, by the way, they are still up year on pandemic, as I call it. So they are actually if you look at current new business formations versus the year of 2019, right? So pre-pandemic, it\u2019s actually 8,000 or so a week. This is all from the U.S. Census Bureau. So, from the standpoint of what we are seeing that kind of emanate into the pipelines and into the top of the funnel, we do have double-digit growth in our digital inbound leads, right. So I think these are at the OSEM ads, where ultimately clients are coming to us, and we\u2019re meeting those clients with our inside sellers and the demand is there, the demand is strong. In terms of the mid-market, the mid-market was a bit softer this quarter than it was last quarter. That said, we also are very excited about the pipeline that we\u2019re seeing in the mid-market that specifically call it the, the tech only, we do have strength in our Employer Services HR outsourcing offering, which also touches the mid-market. So combined, your question around, is there a path to see tremendous growth there between those businesses, we are seeing growth, and we are excited about our overall mid-market position from a competitive landscape. We do have our next-generation payroll engine that\u2019s attached to about 30% to 40% of our mid-market new business sales. And what I will tell you is it\u2019s resonating incredibly well in the market. It\u2019s resonating with the sellers. That\u2019s always a good sign when they like to talk about it and they like the demo it. It\u2019s also resonating in terms of the competitive landscape and more wins. And so we feel that there is definitely a pass. That\u2019s what we\u2019re investing in, both in product and the ecosystem to have the mid-market be as an exciting of a story as the down market is for us.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Very helpful color. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, I want to quickly come back to the PEO. Can you talk a little bit about the kind of the macro headwinds for the PEO order? I think we discussed last time, specifically the insurance attach rates, insurance premiums, kind of blocking PEO growth. Is that still a factor or not any long-term?\nMaria Black: Yes. What I would say is that the PEO demand remains strong. And so we\u2019re bullish about the secular tailwinds of the PEO. We\u2019re bullish about the value proposition. As it relates to benefits and benefits attached. I know there is a lot of discussions, there are a lot of surveys out there from the likes of Kaiser, etcetera, as it relates to our clients making different choices. I think what we see within our base is perhaps some asks of that. And on the peripheral kind of on the margin, perhaps there is price sensitivity as it relates to benefits. What that really allows for is for our sellers just need to be, call it, more surgical as they go to market. But in terms of the value proposition of the PEO and benefits still being a big component of that, that is the case. We skew definitely a bit more white collar in our PEO. In addition to that, our model with a fully insured model is a little bit different. And so the companies that we attract our PEO are still companies that want to be employers of choice, and employers of choice especially in a macro environment, such as this one, where talent is still the name of the game. They want to offer benefits and benefits are a piece of that. So what I would say is we are not seeing huge signs. I think even if you take a look at the revenue [indiscernible], you would be able to see kind of what\u2019s happening with benefit revenue. So there is not huge signs that there is a shift in benefits attractiveness. I think the shift that we see is just the sharpness that our sellers need to have as they position the value proposition and, call it, the right plans and the right rate to the right clients.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. Hey, Maria, I think you talked about 60,000 new run clients in the quarter. Can you help us dimensionalize that? Where would that typically be? And how should we kind of expect that to evolve going forward?\nMaria Black: So the 60,000 clients that I mentioned are specific to our down market, specifically the run platform. So that\u2019s actually 60,000 clients that we started. So where would they be? They would be all over the United States, if you will, from a \u2013 and I\u2019m not trying to be funny about it, but it\u2019s really pretty amazing effort if you think about the volume of clients, the throughput, if you will. They come to us through some of the things that we talked about today, new business formation, they also come to us through our channel ecosystem. So we\u2019ve made a lot of investments into the relationships we have with our CPAs, with our banks. In terms of what does it look like quarter-on-quarter, stating the obvious the third quarter for us is obviously the highest volume quarter. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s kind of fun to give that shout out this quarter because, arguably, I would say that\u2019s not a typical quarter for ADP as it relates to a number of units and the throughput because many of the starts do happen in January in that business. But they are kind of all over the place, and they come to us through the strength of our distribution model and the strength of our overall ecosystem. Does that answer the question, Kevin?\nKevin McVeigh: It did. I guess I was just \u2013 I know Q3 is a high watermark. How should we think about 60,000 maybe relative to Q3 of last year? Was it 40? I mean, just trying to understand like how the momentum is accelerating there? And then just what\u2019s the profitability? Because it sounds like a third were digital onboarded, like the ones that are digitally onboarded, how much more profitable are those than a traditional client that\u2019s onboarded? Just trying to get a sense of if we\u2019re an inflection point in terms of the growth there.\nMaria Black: Yes. Listen, I \u2013 fair enough. I don\u2019t know that I meant to trip myself into giving a quarter-on-quarter number I would tell you is it\u2019s higher than last quarter. It\u2019s higher both in revenue, obviously and the performance. It\u2019s also higher in share unit volume. So I suppose I\u2019ll kind of leave it at that. In terms of the third that comes through the digital onboarding, what that yields is a few things, Kevin, one of which is better experience for the client, right? So our digital onboarded clients have very high, what we call, new business client NPS results, right? So \u2013 and when a client starts with us happier, it yields to a happier client long-term, which yields to a happier and more retentive clients. So I think in terms of what the, call it, margin profile or lifetime value of those clients look like over time, we\u2019re still learning a bit about that, but it\u2019s very optimistic for us as we\u2019re seeing the results. I think the other is it also yields efficiency for our implementation organization, right? So if you think about having the ability to have these clients digitally onboarded allows the more complex onboardings, if you will, perhaps clients are coming to us with more complications around their taxes or maybe from a competitor or something that\u2019s actually demands and implementation person to be involved at a much higher level, it allows their focus to remain there, which also should yield a better experience for those clients. So we\u2019re also seeing that. So overall, we are seeing, and I cited it in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re seeing new clients come on board happier. The digital ones are happier than the non-digital, but they are all happier than they were last year, which is a good thing for us as it relates to the retentive nature of those clients over time and what they will bring to us in terms of lifetime value.\nKevin McVeigh: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thanks very much. I wanted to quickly Maria, ask a clarifying question. On the mid-market, you kind of talked about some of the things that you\u2019re doing there. But just to be clear, it sounds like from your perspective that it\u2019s more issues or things that ADP can do to address versus macro? I just want to make sure understanding kind of your list of objectives and things to do in that segment.\nMaria Black: Absolutely. The mid-market for us still has \u2013 and we\u2019re still experiencing solid mid-market sales, right? And so I don\u2019t \u2013 from my vantage point, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily the softness that we saw in Q3 versus Q2 with a byproduct of a macro type of environment. We\u2019re paying close attention to demand cycles. We\u2019re paying close attention to pipelines. In terms of \u2013 are there some cycles that are perhaps a tiny bit elongated, maybe, there might be some more approvals or approval layers involved, and there may be a little bit of cycle elongation. I would tell you, we\u2019re not seeing that much of that in the mid-market, and it really looks more like \u201819, it looks more like pre-pandemic than it does necessarily something that would give us a belief that there is a macro concern in the mid-market. What I would say is on the macro side, it\u2019s not getting any easier in the mid-market to be a client, right? And so if you think about the complex environment for the mid-market customers and clients, it does continue to increase. And so they are solving for hybrid work, they are solving for talent, they are starving for compliance, regulation. And they are turning to HCM providers such as us, to help with all of that. So I think the macro supports a very strong environment for the mid-market and we do continue to expect to have mid-market growth, including our HRO.\nJames Faucette: Got it. Got it. And then I guess maybe dovetailing with that, can you speak a little bit about the competitive environment? And any changes you\u2019re seeing there? Or what are you seeing from customers? Is there a flight to quality versus maybe some of the regional players and what is the impact of newer entrants? Just can you give us kind of a state of the competitive landscape?\nMaria Black: Sure. I would say the competitive landscape, one way to think about it is it actually hasn\u2019t changed that much. So is there a flight to quality, sure. We\u2019ve seen some of that, but it\u2019s not material at this time as it relates to clients calling us and asking about the macro and what\u2019s happening in the world. We\u2019ve had a few of those calls just recently based on some things that have happened in the environment. But what I would say \u2013 when I think about the competitive environment, we look at this very closely. We just completed our strategic plan process, and we\u2019ve been looking at our competitive position against all the major players, mid-market and others over the last handful of years in a surgical way. What I would offer is a few items, one of which is we have strong retention, specifically in the mid-market. We also have very strong retention in international. We have a near-record highs in NPS. And so I would say that our value proposition and our competitive positioning \u2013 it\u2019s proof, if you will, if you look at the retention, from a balance of trade, we are also winning more away from our competitors than we have in years past. And so again, I think our position is about the same when I look at it year-on-year, but it\u2019s getting perhaps a little bit better on the wind side. And I think that a lot of that does have to do with the quality that we\u2019re providing, so inside kind of the NPS results. Certainly, the investments we\u2019ve made, the investments into our organization to serve our clients better. Some of the things I talked about, new products that we\u2019re leveraging, the likes of AI to actually drive self-service, to drive better experience for our clients, their employees and drive friction out. So I would say, investments into product. And then lastly, again, investments into new products that is creating better wins for us.\nJames Faucette: That\u2019s great. Thank you so much for that color, Maria.\nMaria Black: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKartik Mehta: Don, I know you gave preliminary FY \u201824 guidance. And one of the things you talked about is obviously pays for control moderating. But do you think \u2013 could there be an offset because inflation is still running high and there is a pricing opportunity for the company, especially on the payroll side?\nDon McGuire: Yes, Kartik, it\u2019s a good question. So certainly, talked about pays per control growth decelerating. We called that out. And we\u2019ve also \u2013 I mentioned earlier, for \u201824, I think there is a risk that it decelerates further. So we will have to watch and see what happens there. On the inflation side and pricing, we\u2019re still in the early days of our FY \u201824 plan. So we\u2019re watching it carefully. I think we can say that we are happy with the impact of the results of the price pricing decisions we took in \u201823. We had those readily accepted, I guess, with \u2013 reflected by our higher NPS scores by our continued strong retention. So we have an ability to take price. But as we always come back to, we\u2019re in this for the long haul with our clients, their long-term retention is the most important thing to us. So we need to make sure that we continue to have that good value proposition between what the absolute prices, how much price we can take, etcetera. But once again, Kartik, it\u2019s definitely something we\u2019re looking at and trying to evaluate as we get closer to putting the plan to bid.\nKartik Mehta: And then, Maria, just on the PEO side, could \u2013 is any of the attrition related to maybe customers deciding that they had a PEO and it just got too expensive for them. So they have decided to move out of the PEO for a while until they can get a better understanding of what\u2019s happening in the economy. Any changes like that?\nMaria Black: I would say that\u2019s always the case. I think every year, as we go through renewals, as we go through the year-end cycle, you have clients that are choosing to buy into the PEO and you have clients that are choosing to exit the PEO. When I look at where we get our clients from, obviously, I think we\u2019ve cited multiple times that about 50% of the new business that comes into the PEO comes from our existing ADP base that would suggest that at least 50% come from a non-PEO environment, and we somewhat tend to return them the same way. So that\u2019s not to say that clients don\u2019t, at times, we don\u2019t trade customers between us and the other PEOs. But generally speaking, I think that\u2019s always the case. I don\u2019t believe there is a larger trend toward that this time than there has been in the past. I think, really, in the end, it\u2019s really a byproduct again of kind of what we saw with the renewal post pandemic and what the impact of that as we headed into this selling cycle, if you will.\nKartik Mehta: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I also wanted to follow-up on the PEO and particularly on the bookings reacceleration. I\u2019m just curious how much of that reacceleration is sort of from a better kind of external demand environment versus changes in your sales strategy? I\u2019m just trying to figure out how much is sort of push versus pull when it comes to that recovery. And I guess the underlying question is your confidence level that this reacceleration is a sustainable trend?\nMaria Black: Fair. Thank you, Ramsey. We are excited about the PEO reacceleration, specifically what we saw in March and obviously, how we feel stepping into this final stretch. I think it is too early to comment on the finish, but the pipelines are strong. What I would tell you is that I\u2019m bullish about the demand in the market for the PEO and the overall value proposition. So all things being equal, I think we\u2019re positioned well as anybody else as it relates to the overall PEO, I guess, demand, if you will, right? So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a \u2013 the reacceleration was really, in my mind, more a byproduct of top of funnel filling the pipeline. We made a lot of investments into our seller ecosystem and the PEO. We have incentives that we can pull. In addition to that, we\u2019ve invested into \u2013 and I think I\u2019ve talked about it a couple of times on these calls. We\u2019ve invested into artificial intelligence that actually looks across our base to a project where we are actually looking at the ADP base to try to serve up the right, call it, PEO seller at the right time to the right ADP clients. So we\u2019re getting smarter. I am not doing a good job saying it outside of we are getting smarter in terms of who we are actually targeting on the PEO using technology today that didn\u2019t exist. So, I think all of that has kind of yielded to what I would say is a strong execution by the PEO sales team to drive the reacceleration that we would expect and that we are excited to see and optimistic that it will continue.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay, great. And a quick follow-up, when you look across the business, are you seeing any vertical-specific areas of softness maybe tech or commercial real estate or financial services? Are there any worrisome kind of verticals that you are keeping an eye on?\nMaria Black: Are you referring to the PEO specifically or the overall macro?\nRamsey El-Assal: I know. I should have been more clear. Just more broadly across the business, are there any \u2013 you guys have a pretty broad macro view. And I am just curious if there is any specific areas that are causing any concern in terms of recent trends?\nDon McGuire: Yes. Maybe I will jump in. I think in terms of verticals, certainly seeing all the reports and reading all the things about commercial real estate that everyone else is. That\u2019s \u2013 we look at the breadth and the distribution of our client base, it\u2019s pretty broad. So, I am not so sure that we are seeing any particular verticals that are causing us any undue concern at this time. I would say, has been reported, Maria mentioned it in the prepared remarks, certainly, the enterprise space, the up-market space is where there has been a lot more layoffs announced, etcetera particularly in tech. So, we are looking at that. We have said in the past though that\u2019s not the biggest part of our business. So, even though there is some more softness in that end of the market, it\u2019s being more than offset by the success we are having in the down in the mid-market. So, from a particular vertical, nothing in particular.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSamad Samana: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first one, Maria, just I wanted to maybe get a better understanding when you are talking about a change in maybe the investment \u2013 investing philosophy of the company just as you are adjusting to the macro environment evolving as well. Is that more around maybe pulling back on hiring? Is that more about maybe redirecting where resources are? Can you maybe just help us better understand what that translates into? And maybe how we should think about that impacting both the top and bottom line?\nMaria Black: Yes. Thanks Samad and good morning. I am happy to talk about modernization. It\u2019s one of my favorite topics as all of you are probably learning from my prepared remarks. And I think it\u2019s important to think about the modernization journey we have been on and how it really can set us up for kind of future growth and future margin, if you will, as a company. And that\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about for us. I think we have been undergoing transformation. We have been undergoing modernization for years. I would actually suggest that ADP has been modernizing for the last 73 years as we have invested in technology to make things better for us as a business to become more efficient, and we have been investing in our clients and in product to make it easier for them. And so I think that\u2019s not a new cycle. The way I think about modernization is really a client first lens, right. So, it\u2019s really about all the things that I cited. It\u2019s about taking out friction. The way I think about the investment, which is your question, Samad, is it\u2019s an imperative for us to continue to invest in modernization because it\u2019s the modernization that over time has really allowed us to reinvest in growth and reinvest in the business. And we are committed to a continued journey of growth and margin. And as a result of really the way we have been able to do this. So for us, it\u2019s really about both. It\u2019s really about the end, right. So, it\u2019s about growth and margin expansion. And I think this virtuous cycle that we have been on really as a company for a very long time, which is we make things easier, we make them better. We become more efficient. We make things better for our clients, and that allows us to invest in growth and it allows us to invest in \u2013 back into our shareholders, if you will, in margins. So, it\u2019s really an end story and it\u2019s key to who ADP is and it will be a key for us as we go forward. In terms of the commentary that I made around how we are thinking about it and the macroeconomic backdrop, it is an important time to make sure we are making the right choices and the right trade-offs. I mentioned earlier, we have been in the middle of our strategic planning process the last quarter. And as we have gone through the business, if you will, end-to-end, rest assured that we are trying as a company to make the very best decisions to have the very best outcomes as it relates to growth and margin.\nSamad Samana: Great. I appreciate that. And then just one quick follow-up for Don, I was just looking at the guidance by segments and the margin for ES, it looks like you have settled it out at the \u2013 within the range at the lower end. I am just curious maybe what drove that? Is that \u2013 is it purely float contribution driven, or is that more the result of just bookings being better, so expenses being pulled forward? Just help me understand why that was narrowed to the lower end of the range, please?\nDon McGuire: Yes. I think there is a couple of things going on. One, certainly, we are continuing to benefit from bookings growth, retention, price pays per controllers all a little bit stronger. And we certainly are getting lots of tailwinds. We have lots of tailwinds in Q3, in particular, from client fund interest. So, that\u2019s been very helpful for us. The things slow a little bit from a client from an interest perspective in Q4. So, that certainly is not as helpful as it was. And we are of course, as Maria just mentioned, we are taking advantage of some of those extra flow funds that we have to invest \u2013 reinvest in the business or continue to invest in the business on modernization. So, it\u2019s all about I think trying to find the right balance and still delivering the \u2013 as we mentioned, higher end of the earnings per share prediction or guidance. So, it\u2019s all to find the right balance, and we will continue to invest in modernization and deliver improvements as we go forward.\nSamad Samana: Great. Appreciate taking my questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Could you walk through the 140 basis points of PEO margin expansion in Q3? It seems pretty notable given the deceleration in PEO revenue growth. And in particular, could you unpack the size of the workers\u2019 compensation reserve release in Q3?\nDanny Hussain: It was $17 million. You will see it in the Q compared to $7 million last year. So, it wasn\u2019t a huge amount.\nDon McGuire: But those are the two impacts. So, the biggest impact was the reserve adjustment on workers\u2019 comp. And the other big item there is the lower SUI costs. So, there is virtually no margins on SUI. So, SUI comes down at the top, it certainly improves the margins. So, those would be the two major impacts on the margin improvement in PEO.\nDavid Togut: Got it. And then just as a follow-up, Don, could you walk through your strategy on managing the tax filing float going forward? We have got a pretty steeply inverted yield curve right now, which means it\u2019s actually more expensive for you to borrow in the commercial paper market and invest flow medium-term duration bonds. Are you thinking of shifting the investment portfolio at all in the year ahead?\nDon McGuire: We have had that strategy in place for some 20 years or so. And we have realized about $2.8 billion of incremental benefit from that strategy. And so we have a strategy in place. We always revisit these strategies and look at them. It\u2019s true that the yield curve is inverted for the seventh time in 50 years. How long that continues, not sure. But we will continue to look at that strategy and see what we need to do, if anything, to change it as we go forward. But it is something we have been committed to and we followed closely. Near-term, certainly we have benefited this quarter because of the inflow of funds in calendar Q1, there is a big balance or a big benefit there to us. So, as we go forward, we will continue to look at the opportunities and decide if we need to make any material changes to the investment strategy.\nDanny Hussain: David, one point worth clarifying because this has come up before. If you look at the last slide of our earnings presentation, you will see a disaggregation of client short extended and long. And one thing I think is worth emphasizing is that we are net long exposed to the client short. In other words, if short-term interest rates went up and up and up, that would actually be beneficial to our earnings and our margins. It just shows up in two different places, which can often cause confusion. But it\u2019s actually not hurtful to us to have these higher borrowing costs because we have more dollars invested long in the client short portfolio.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Very good morning everybody. Maria, you talked about modernization. Can you talk about the areas of emphasis? And one area that I am particularly interested in is international and what you are seeing there in terms of opportunities? Thank you.\nMaria Black: Sure. So overall, I think modernization is really about end-to-end. So, think of it as product and continuing to make investments in ensuring our products are next generation, if you will. And that\u2019s certainly the case across many pieces of our portfolio, and you are well aware of the investments we are making in next-generation technology. I think product is a big piece of it. I think other is the internal modernization. So, that would be everything from go-to-market to call it, the seller ecosystem modernization. I think I have spoken to that quite a bit in the past as well as how we actually serve our clients. And again, we reference that today. So, kind of going back to modernization specifically in our opportunity in international, we are very excited about our position in international, very excited about the opportunity that we have. And this is definitely an area that we have been modernizing. So, if you think about each and every country that we serve over 140 countries today that we have offers over time, we have been modernizing the platforms, and we have been consolidating platforms. But to your point, Mark, that work is not done. And so we still have that journey that we have been on is the journey that we are going to continue. But as we do that, we are also focused on ensuring that we continue to make the investments to the platforms, and we continue to make the investments into the overall ecosystem of how we serve our clients international to really drive further, call it, opportunity. And so there are still places in international, and I will probably leave it with, we will be back next quarter to talk more about things such as our growth strategy. But I think as it relates to international all of that modernization should also yield a growth opportunity for us because it\u2019s still a big world and there are places that we \u2013 even though we are in more countries than anybody else, there are countries that we don\u2019t exist, there are segments within certain countries where our offer still has opportunity. And so we were incredibly excited about the overall international space where we are, the work that we are doing and where we are going.\nMark Marcon: That\u2019s great. And Maria, can you talk a little bit about just what the appetite is? And obviously, it\u2019s diverse across the globe. But broadly speaking, are you seeing a greater level of interest in terms of modernization of HR and HCM systems across the globe? Certainly has been an ongoing trend in the U.S. for quite some time. But just I am hearing from others that there is a pickup in terms of RFPs that are occurring things of that nature and that we could be at the early stages of higher levels of growth, international macro notwithstanding?\nMaria Black: What I would suggest, Mark, is that over the last few years, the conversation in the international space has definitely shifted a bit, and I could suggest the same thing, which is that it\u2019s picked up. And so that conversation today tends to lead with more of a global offer, global system of record kind of conversation. So, we walk in today and we have a conversation with a client more often than not about how many countries are you in and where can we help serve you and how can we tie it all together to make an ability for that client to really see across multiple countries and have more of a unified experience versus, I would say, perhaps 5 years, 10 years ago, it was more of a country-by-country conversation. Today, it\u2019s more \u2013 it starts with a multi-country conversation. And so I think all of that suggests, but it appears you have heard from others, which is the narrative in the international is shifting. I think there is greater demand for HCM offerings in international as it relates to companies now that are more global than they have ever been. And certainly, the hybrid environment has accelerated that a bit. And the ability for companies to be able to see their workforces and make talent decisions, headcount decisions across multiple countries. That\u2019s a very different conversation today than it was just a few years ago. And we see that when we have, we just recently, actually, this quarter, we had all of our international clients together at an event. And the topic is about their transformation. It\u2019s about their HCM transformation and the partnership that we have with them to solve for them. And I think the beauty of ADP is that we have the ability to solve the MNC, the multi-country piece. And we also have the ability to solve the in-country. And a lot of times, for clients, it\u2019s a mix of both. And so it\u2019s really about the flexibility we have in our partnership options to serve these clients in a very unique way.\nMark Marcon: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have time for one more question. And that question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey. Thank you so much and you covered a lot already. I just wanted on the down-market side, given the success in the bookings here. Just curious if that\u2019s changing your thinking and investing more or even less, maybe in ASO versus PSO then the digital sales versus the seller ecosystem? I am curious as we are going into fiscal \u201824 here, if there is any maybe change in thinking in prioritization there?\nMaria Black: So, we have leaned into the down market in terms of the investments we have made. So, when I think I referenced earlier the seller headcount as we head into the final stretch here and how pleased we are with the investments we have made in headcount and the ecosystem around them, so investments into the channels, things of that nature. And as all of that turns into more productivity because the headcount is actually gaining tenure. It is primarily setting those investments have been in the down-market. So again, think our SPF platform, the retirement services, insurance services, most of that also comes into our digital sales organization, also known as the inside sales. So, we are making investments into inside sales to really serve the down market. And what I would suggest is that from our viewpoint at this point, the demand is there. We have leaned into that demand and we will continue to lean into the demand to drive the growth that we are driving out of the down-market as long as it exists, if you will.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes. No, I am glad to hear it. If you don\u2019t mind one more question. Just I have to ask you since you mentioned Maria with AI. We have been getting a lot of questions on generative AI and ChatGPT. You mentioned being smarter around serving up PEO when necessary at the right time. But just broadly speaking, how are you thinking about generative AI and how that might help you run your business better, both from a sales perspective, but also from a delivery perspective, support standpoint?\nMaria Black: Yes. Thank you, Tien-Tsin. I am actually \u2013 I am thrilled you asked this question because I was counting on it during this call because it definitely seems like it\u2019s the topic du jour. But the real answer is, just like everybody else, we are incredibly excited about generative AI. We have been very excited about AI for quite some time. You mentioned what we have been doing for our sellers in the PEO, that\u2019s broad-based work that we have been doing for a long time and continued to invest in AI into making us more efficient. That example is about our sellers. We are making similar investments even with the new technologies that are out there to really look at how we can make our service associates as well as our sellers more productive. So, you think about all the things that an agent, if you will, does today to support a client and some of the generative AI tools that can drive a different level of efficiency. And we are very excited. We have I think it\u2019s something around like 44 different work streams that are underway currently to take a look at different ways that we can leverage these tools internally. That\u2019s also notwithstanding the opportunity that it creates for our industry, right. So, if you think about the HCM industry, there are still very many things inside of HCM that are administrative in nature in terms of whether it\u2019s job descriptions, performance reviews, things that are maybe handbook, things that are very tactical that really a time pulled back the practitioner from doing what they want to do, which is be a strategic partner. And so we are really excited to put these tools also into our product for our clients and our practitioners to be able to lean into. So, all that said, we are very excited about the opportunity. One thing I would point out because it\u2019s important, and it\u2019s also very topical right now, which is that the good news is we have been doing a lot of this work. And as such, we have standards. We have a way to think about the ethical nature and that kind of comes at parity with who we are, given that we have the big data, if you will, behind ADP and the 40 million wage earners that we pay. And so when we think about all of this, also with the lens of doing it the right way and making sure that it\u2019s applicable, it\u2019s secure, it\u2019s compliance, all the things that you would expect from ADP. But no doubt, Tien-Tsin, that we are excited about the opportunity it creates for us internally and the opportunity that it creates for us and our product to really serve the industry, right, and make this entire industry that much more strategic and not much more exciting. So, great question.\nTien-Tsin Huang: No. Hope to learn more soon \u2013 talk soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Maria Black for closing remarks.\nMaria Black: Thank you. So, first and foremost, thank you everybody for joining today. Really appreciate the questions and the interest. As you can imagine, I sit here one quarter into my new role as CEO and I get a lot of questions. Just last night, I got another text that said, how were the first 100 days, how is the first quarter, what have you been up to? And here is what I would offer. The third quarter for ADP, and you heard it in my tone today, you have heard it in my excitement about some of the volumes and the throughput, but the third quarter is really where you see ADP shine. And it is our finest quarter. You have year-end, you have busy season, you have selling season that all kind of come together. In this quarter, what I would say is adding some economic strangeness and questions about what\u2019s happening in the world, and I would say that sitting here one quarter in, I couldn\u2019t be more excited. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased. I couldn\u2019t be more grateful for the share execution of our associates. So, I felt the breadth and depth of ADP this quarter at its finest. And with that, I just want to take another minute to thank our associates for everything that they do to power this great company. I would also like to thank all of our partners and stakeholders and everyone on the call listening today. I couldn\u2019t be more proud and more excited about this company. And with that, we will wrap up the call.\nOperator: This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "content": "Thank you, Danny and thank you everyone for joining us. For our third quarter, we delivered strong results, including 10% organic constant currency revenue growth, 110 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion and 14% adjusted EPS growth. Our continued solid financial performance underscores the power of our innovative and mission-critical HCM solutions that serve over 1 million diverse clients around the world as well as our highly recurring revenue business model. As usual, I will start with some highlights from the quarter. The demand environment was healthy overall. And in Q3, we drove another quarter of solid Employer Services, new business bookings growth, representing a record Q3 bookings amount. Bookings performance continues to be particularly strong in our downmarket portfolio. In Q3, we sold and started over 60,000 new run clients, where a new user experience has helped us reach record level new client satisfaction rates these past few quarters. We also had strong bookings results in our insurance and retirement services offerings supported not only by legislative tailwinds, but also by the competitive positioning of our downmarket HCM ecosystem. Demand for our employer services HR outsourcing solutions remained high and we have recently reached the 10,000 client mark. We also saw continued booking strength in our compliance-oriented solutions, including tax remittance and wage payments, which have always been key differentiators for us. On a year-to-date basis, we are within our bookings guidance range and are trending in line with our expectations from the outset of the year and we look forward to finishing the year with a strong close. Our employer services retention rate came in better than expected once again. While we continue to experience normalization in our downmarket out of business rates, this was offset by the strong retention rates in our U.S. mid-market and international businesses, both of which continue to benefit from years of improving client satisfaction. As such, we are pleased to be raising our full year retention guidance. Our employer services paid for control grew 4% for the quarter and continues to decelerate at a very gradual pace. As we have seen for several quarters now, layoffs at many larger companies have been offset by the labor demand elsewhere, which in total has resulted in year-over-year employment growth. With this continued resilience, we are pleased to expect the higher end of our previous pays per control guidance range. Last, on our PEO, while growth in revenue and average works on employees continued to decelerate this quarter, we were pleased to see PEO bookings growth reaccelerate nicely in Q3, especially in March. This represented a much better performance than we experienced in Q2 and resulted in our largest quarter for PEO bookings ever. Despite the current inflationary environment and broad-based macroeconomic uncertainty, we are focused on our PEO sales execution and on delivering continued strong client satisfaction and we remain confident in the long-term secular growth opportunity. Stepping back, while we are pleased to be on track to deliver very strong full year financial results, we are even more excited about how we are leveraging our unmatched scale and decades of innovation experience to drive continued progress on our important modernization journey. We are making our solutions more powerful and easier to use and we are making our unparalleled insight and expertise more accessible than ever. In doing all this, we are delivering an experience that\u2019s better for our clients, better for their employees and better for ADP. I mentioned the tens of thousands of new clients we onboarded in our downmarket, over a third of those clients utilized our digital onboarding experience, yielding a faster time to start, happier clients and greater productivity for our implementation team. We just completed our busy year-end period during which we helped our clients with over 75 million U.S. tax forms and to further enhance the client experience, we proactively service critical year-end data to our clients before they had to search for it. This not only reduced friction for them, but also reduced the number of calls and interactions with our service teams. For years, we have directly engaged and served our clients\u2019 employees through channels like Wisely. As we focus on the overall employee experience we can offer, we continue to add valuable functionality like a savings envelope that employees have used to move more than $1 billion into savings over the last 12 months and a new financial wellness hub with tips, tools and education to drive better financial outcomes. With our new intelligent self-service solution, we are already interacting with over 3 million client employees per month through our action card feature. And our voice of employee solution is helping thousands of clients obtain better insights from their employee population, which can drive higher engagement and satisfaction for those employees. The opportunity to continue creating value and efficiency in the world of work is meaningful and we believe these modern approaches that reduce friction and exceed client expectations will help us deliver on that in the coming years. With that in mind, I want to provide some perspective on how we are strategically positioning ourselves to invest over the near-term given the economic backdrop. As we shared earlier this year, in fiscal 2023, we were impacted by higher wage inflation. We also added to our service and implementation capacity to meet the expectations of our growing client base and we invested throughout the year in sales and product. As we position for potential economic slowdown beyond this fiscal year, we are being thoughtful about how we prioritize our investments. At the same time, we are very much committed to our ongoing modernization journey, which is critical to our sustainable growth and that will require continued steady reinvestment into the business. In the coming quarters, I look forward to updating you on near-term growth priorities for ADP. Before turning it over to Don, I want to take a moment to recognize our associates for their continued focus on helping our clients through the many challenges they face each day, especially amid these uncertain times. Resiliency and partnerships represent core components of the ADP brand promise and are among the many reasons businesses around the world choose to partner with a leader in the industry. Our unrelenting support through years of growth, years of challenge and the years in between is something they have grown to count on and we are honored to support them. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Don. Yes. I think, Brian, if I can just comment on the quarter-over-quarter real quick as I think you mentioned the sequential growth Q2 to Q3 and works on employees. That is something that obviously we noticed as well and as Don mentioned, from a medium-term perspective, we are definitely still committed from the medium-term to the works on employee growth that we have guided to for that. However, as it relates to kind of the quarter-over-quarter, we noticed the same thing that you noticed. And obviously, that\u2019s not the ideal situation and we are hopeful that won\u2019t be the case as you look sequentially on the quarter-to-quarter, Q3 to Q4, but also year-on-year. And I think that\u2019s really a byproduct of timing and that timing is really about retention, right. So it\u2019s really about, call it, third quarter retention results, which we have cited before were a bit softer than we expected. And as a result of that, you see the sequential piece to the quarter-on-quarter. In terms of the type being. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a function of more white collar, I think it\u2019s really a function of some of the feelings that we have post-pandemic as the renewals have really been kind of, call it, rippling through the business of the PEO. So it\u2019s really a byproduct of some of the post-pandemic impact that we saw in the PEO. So it\u2019s really a byproduct of the retention softness that we saw in the first quarter, in the second quarter and then quarter-on-quarter this past quarter. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily a byproduct of \u2013 because retention continues, albeit it\u2019s normalizing a bit in the down market. We do have very strong retention in the mid-market. We also have strong retention, albeit tiny bit less than last year in the down market. So I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s a byproduct of the client base or white collar, I think it\u2019s really a byproduct of kind of a post-pandemic environment in the PEO. Yes. So I\u2019ll let Don comment on the \u2013 how the bookings kind of relate to the models on the revenue side. But from an overall bookings perspective, what we cited in the prepared remarks is that we do anticipate the middle of the range. So we did keep the range constant. So it\u2019s constant with the outset of the year, it\u2019s also constant with last quarter\u2019s guidance. So we are keeping that 6% to 9% range. We do anticipate at this point, the middle of that range. And we feel pretty confident heading into the fourth quarter when we take a look at how we exited March, but also taking a look at the number of sellers we have, the investments we\u2019ve made into the ecosystem and as those sellers ultimately gain tenure because we\u2019re actually lapping a lot of new hires that we had, if you will, a year ago. So pretty excited as we step in the other part of that. Confidence is really about what we\u2019re seeing as it relates to the overall pipeline. So pipelines are strong. That\u2019s more of a, call it, enterprise and international or large deal type of comment. We\u2019re seeing tremendous activity in the top of the funnel still upmarket. So the down market continues to shine for us, and that\u2019s really supported by what we\u2019re seeing in continued increases in new business formations. We\u2019re also seeing those new business formations generate inbound leads. So we\u2019re seeing good activity on the digital side. So feel confident as we step into the fourth quarter, and then I\u2019ll let Don comment on how the \u2013 ultimately where we land in the fourth quarter and how that translates into revenue for us next year. Absolutely. So I\u2019ll start with the down market, just to kind of reiterate the strength we\u2019re seeing there top of funnel. So we are very pleased with what we saw in the performance of the down market. That\u2019s also inclusive of the down market ecosystem. So I think this is our run platform. I talked about the third quarter onboarding 60,000 clients. It\u2019s pretty incredible. Those clients also, many of them have attach rates of our retirement services offering, our insurance services offering. So the entire down market portfolio it\u2019s definitely performing well for us and has for quite some time. It is driven by what we\u2019re seeing macro. And so you just kind of reiterate what we\u2019ve seen as new business formations are up year-on-year, 8%, by the way, they are still up year on pandemic, as I call it. So they are actually if you look at current new business formations versus the year of 2019, right? So pre-pandemic, it\u2019s actually 8,000 or so a week. This is all from the U.S. Census Bureau. So, from the standpoint of what we are seeing that kind of emanate into the pipelines and into the top of the funnel, we do have double-digit growth in our digital inbound leads, right. So I think these are at the OSEM ads, where ultimately clients are coming to us, and we\u2019re meeting those clients with our inside sellers and the demand is there, the demand is strong. In terms of the mid-market, the mid-market was a bit softer this quarter than it was last quarter. That said, we also are very excited about the pipeline that we\u2019re seeing in the mid-market that specifically call it the, the tech only, we do have strength in our Employer Services HR outsourcing offering, which also touches the mid-market. So combined, your question around, is there a path to see tremendous growth there between those businesses, we are seeing growth, and we are excited about our overall mid-market position from a competitive landscape. We do have our next-generation payroll engine that\u2019s attached to about 30% to 40% of our mid-market new business sales. And what I will tell you is it\u2019s resonating incredibly well in the market. It\u2019s resonating with the sellers. That\u2019s always a good sign when they like to talk about it and they like the demo it. It\u2019s also resonating in terms of the competitive landscape and more wins. And so we feel that there is definitely a pass. That\u2019s what we\u2019re investing in, both in product and the ecosystem to have the mid-market be as an exciting of a story as the down market is for us. Yes. What I would say is that the PEO demand remains strong. And so we\u2019re bullish about the secular tailwinds of the PEO. We\u2019re bullish about the value proposition. As it relates to benefits and benefits attached. I know there is a lot of discussions, there are a lot of surveys out there from the likes of Kaiser, etcetera, as it relates to our clients making different choices. I think what we see within our base is perhaps some asks of that. And on the peripheral kind of on the margin, perhaps there is price sensitivity as it relates to benefits. What that really allows for is for our sellers just need to be, call it, more surgical as they go to market. But in terms of the value proposition of the PEO and benefits still being a big component of that, that is the case. We skew definitely a bit more white collar in our PEO. In addition to that, our model with a fully insured model is a little bit different. And so the companies that we attract our PEO are still companies that want to be employers of choice, and employers of choice especially in a macro environment, such as this one, where talent is still the name of the game. They want to offer benefits and benefits are a piece of that. So what I would say is we are not seeing huge signs. I think even if you take a look at the revenue [indiscernible], you would be able to see kind of what\u2019s happening with benefit revenue. So there is not huge signs that there is a shift in benefits attractiveness. I think the shift that we see is just the sharpness that our sellers need to have as they position the value proposition and, call it, the right plans and the right rate to the right clients. So the 60,000 clients that I mentioned are specific to our down market, specifically the run platform. So that\u2019s actually 60,000 clients that we started. So where would they be? They would be all over the United States, if you will, from a \u2013 and I\u2019m not trying to be funny about it, but it\u2019s really pretty amazing effort if you think about the volume of clients, the throughput, if you will. They come to us through some of the things that we talked about today, new business formation, they also come to us through our channel ecosystem. So we\u2019ve made a lot of investments into the relationships we have with our CPAs, with our banks. In terms of what does it look like quarter-on-quarter, stating the obvious the third quarter for us is obviously the highest volume quarter. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s kind of fun to give that shout out this quarter because, arguably, I would say that\u2019s not a typical quarter for ADP as it relates to a number of units and the throughput because many of the starts do happen in January in that business. But they are kind of all over the place, and they come to us through the strength of our distribution model and the strength of our overall ecosystem. Does that answer the question, Kevin? Yes. Listen, I \u2013 fair enough. I don\u2019t know that I meant to trip myself into giving a quarter-on-quarter number I would tell you is it\u2019s higher than last quarter. It\u2019s higher both in revenue, obviously and the performance. It\u2019s also higher in share unit volume. So I suppose I\u2019ll kind of leave it at that. In terms of the third that comes through the digital onboarding, what that yields is a few things, Kevin, one of which is better experience for the client, right? So our digital onboarded clients have very high, what we call, new business client NPS results, right? So \u2013 and when a client starts with us happier, it yields to a happier client long-term, which yields to a happier and more retentive clients. So I think in terms of what the, call it, margin profile or lifetime value of those clients look like over time, we\u2019re still learning a bit about that, but it\u2019s very optimistic for us as we\u2019re seeing the results. I think the other is it also yields efficiency for our implementation organization, right? So if you think about having the ability to have these clients digitally onboarded allows the more complex onboardings, if you will, perhaps clients are coming to us with more complications around their taxes or maybe from a competitor or something that\u2019s actually demands and implementation person to be involved at a much higher level, it allows their focus to remain there, which also should yield a better experience for those clients. So we\u2019re also seeing that. So overall, we are seeing, and I cited it in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re seeing new clients come on board happier. The digital ones are happier than the non-digital, but they are all happier than they were last year, which is a good thing for us as it relates to the retentive nature of those clients over time and what they will bring to us in terms of lifetime value. Absolutely. The mid-market for us still has \u2013 and we\u2019re still experiencing solid mid-market sales, right? And so I don\u2019t \u2013 from my vantage point, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily the softness that we saw in Q3 versus Q2 with a byproduct of a macro type of environment. We\u2019re paying close attention to demand cycles. We\u2019re paying close attention to pipelines. In terms of \u2013 are there some cycles that are perhaps a tiny bit elongated, maybe, there might be some more approvals or approval layers involved, and there may be a little bit of cycle elongation. I would tell you, we\u2019re not seeing that much of that in the mid-market, and it really looks more like \u201819, it looks more like pre-pandemic than it does necessarily something that would give us a belief that there is a macro concern in the mid-market. What I would say is on the macro side, it\u2019s not getting any easier in the mid-market to be a client, right? And so if you think about the complex environment for the mid-market customers and clients, it does continue to increase. And so they are solving for hybrid work, they are solving for talent, they are starving for compliance, regulation. And they are turning to HCM providers such as us, to help with all of that. So I think the macro supports a very strong environment for the mid-market and we do continue to expect to have mid-market growth, including our HRO. Sure. I would say the competitive landscape, one way to think about it is it actually hasn\u2019t changed that much. So is there a flight to quality, sure. We\u2019ve seen some of that, but it\u2019s not material at this time as it relates to clients calling us and asking about the macro and what\u2019s happening in the world. We\u2019ve had a few of those calls just recently based on some things that have happened in the environment. But what I would say \u2013 when I think about the competitive environment, we look at this very closely. We just completed our strategic plan process, and we\u2019ve been looking at our competitive position against all the major players, mid-market and others over the last handful of years in a surgical way. What I would offer is a few items, one of which is we have strong retention, specifically in the mid-market. We also have very strong retention in international. We have a near-record highs in NPS. And so I would say that our value proposition and our competitive positioning \u2013 it\u2019s proof, if you will, if you look at the retention, from a balance of trade, we are also winning more away from our competitors than we have in years past. And so again, I think our position is about the same when I look at it year-on-year, but it\u2019s getting perhaps a little bit better on the wind side. And I think that a lot of that does have to do with the quality that we\u2019re providing, so inside kind of the NPS results. Certainly, the investments we\u2019ve made, the investments into our organization to serve our clients better. Some of the things I talked about, new products that we\u2019re leveraging, the likes of AI to actually drive self-service, to drive better experience for our clients, their employees and drive friction out. So I would say, investments into product. And then lastly, again, investments into new products that is creating better wins for us. You bet. I would say that\u2019s always the case. I think every year, as we go through renewals, as we go through the year-end cycle, you have clients that are choosing to buy into the PEO and you have clients that are choosing to exit the PEO. When I look at where we get our clients from, obviously, I think we\u2019ve cited multiple times that about 50% of the new business that comes into the PEO comes from our existing ADP base that would suggest that at least 50% come from a non-PEO environment, and we somewhat tend to return them the same way. So that\u2019s not to say that clients don\u2019t, at times, we don\u2019t trade customers between us and the other PEOs. But generally speaking, I think that\u2019s always the case. I don\u2019t believe there is a larger trend toward that this time than there has been in the past. I think, really, in the end, it\u2019s really a byproduct again of kind of what we saw with the renewal post pandemic and what the impact of that as we headed into this selling cycle, if you will. Fair. Thank you, Ramsey. We are excited about the PEO reacceleration, specifically what we saw in March and obviously, how we feel stepping into this final stretch. I think it is too early to comment on the finish, but the pipelines are strong. What I would tell you is that I\u2019m bullish about the demand in the market for the PEO and the overall value proposition. So all things being equal, I think we\u2019re positioned well as anybody else as it relates to the overall PEO, I guess, demand, if you will, right? So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a \u2013 the reacceleration was really, in my mind, more a byproduct of top of funnel filling the pipeline. We made a lot of investments into our seller ecosystem and the PEO. We have incentives that we can pull. In addition to that, we\u2019ve invested into \u2013 and I think I\u2019ve talked about it a couple of times on these calls. We\u2019ve invested into artificial intelligence that actually looks across our base to a project where we are actually looking at the ADP base to try to serve up the right, call it, PEO seller at the right time to the right ADP clients. So we\u2019re getting smarter. I am not doing a good job saying it outside of we are getting smarter in terms of who we are actually targeting on the PEO using technology today that didn\u2019t exist. So, I think all of that has kind of yielded to what I would say is a strong execution by the PEO sales team to drive the reacceleration that we would expect and that we are excited to see and optimistic that it will continue. Are you referring to the PEO specifically or the overall macro? Yes. Thanks Samad and good morning. I am happy to talk about modernization. It\u2019s one of my favorite topics as all of you are probably learning from my prepared remarks. And I think it\u2019s important to think about the modernization journey we have been on and how it really can set us up for kind of future growth and future margin, if you will, as a company. And that\u2019s really what it\u2019s all about for us. I think we have been undergoing transformation. We have been undergoing modernization for years. I would actually suggest that ADP has been modernizing for the last 73 years as we have invested in technology to make things better for us as a business to become more efficient, and we have been investing in our clients and in product to make it easier for them. And so I think that\u2019s not a new cycle. The way I think about modernization is really a client first lens, right. So, it\u2019s really about all the things that I cited. It\u2019s about taking out friction. The way I think about the investment, which is your question, Samad, is it\u2019s an imperative for us to continue to invest in modernization because it\u2019s the modernization that over time has really allowed us to reinvest in growth and reinvest in the business. And we are committed to a continued journey of growth and margin. And as a result of really the way we have been able to do this. So for us, it\u2019s really about both. It\u2019s really about the end, right. So, it\u2019s about growth and margin expansion. And I think this virtuous cycle that we have been on really as a company for a very long time, which is we make things easier, we make them better. We become more efficient. We make things better for our clients, and that allows us to invest in growth and it allows us to invest in \u2013 back into our shareholders, if you will, in margins. So, it\u2019s really an end story and it\u2019s key to who ADP is and it will be a key for us as we go forward. In terms of the commentary that I made around how we are thinking about it and the macroeconomic backdrop, it is an important time to make sure we are making the right choices and the right trade-offs. I mentioned earlier, we have been in the middle of our strategic planning process the last quarter. And as we have gone through the business, if you will, end-to-end, rest assured that we are trying as a company to make the very best decisions to have the very best outcomes as it relates to growth and margin. Sure. So overall, I think modernization is really about end-to-end. So, think of it as product and continuing to make investments in ensuring our products are next generation, if you will. And that\u2019s certainly the case across many pieces of our portfolio, and you are well aware of the investments we are making in next-generation technology. I think product is a big piece of it. I think other is the internal modernization. So, that would be everything from go-to-market to call it, the seller ecosystem modernization. I think I have spoken to that quite a bit in the past as well as how we actually serve our clients. And again, we reference that today. So, kind of going back to modernization specifically in our opportunity in international, we are very excited about our position in international, very excited about the opportunity that we have. And this is definitely an area that we have been modernizing. So, if you think about each and every country that we serve over 140 countries today that we have offers over time, we have been modernizing the platforms, and we have been consolidating platforms. But to your point, Mark, that work is not done. And so we still have that journey that we have been on is the journey that we are going to continue. But as we do that, we are also focused on ensuring that we continue to make the investments to the platforms, and we continue to make the investments into the overall ecosystem of how we serve our clients international to really drive further, call it, opportunity. And so there are still places in international, and I will probably leave it with, we will be back next quarter to talk more about things such as our growth strategy. But I think as it relates to international all of that modernization should also yield a growth opportunity for us because it\u2019s still a big world and there are places that we \u2013 even though we are in more countries than anybody else, there are countries that we don\u2019t exist, there are segments within certain countries where our offer still has opportunity. And so we were incredibly excited about the overall international space where we are, the work that we are doing and where we are going. What I would suggest, Mark, is that over the last few years, the conversation in the international space has definitely shifted a bit, and I could suggest the same thing, which is that it\u2019s picked up. And so that conversation today tends to lead with more of a global offer, global system of record kind of conversation. So, we walk in today and we have a conversation with a client more often than not about how many countries are you in and where can we help serve you and how can we tie it all together to make an ability for that client to really see across multiple countries and have more of a unified experience versus, I would say, perhaps 5 years, 10 years ago, it was more of a country-by-country conversation. Today, it\u2019s more \u2013 it starts with a multi-country conversation. And so I think all of that suggests, but it appears you have heard from others, which is the narrative in the international is shifting. I think there is greater demand for HCM offerings in international as it relates to companies now that are more global than they have ever been. And certainly, the hybrid environment has accelerated that a bit. And the ability for companies to be able to see their workforces and make talent decisions, headcount decisions across multiple countries. That\u2019s a very different conversation today than it was just a few years ago. And we see that when we have, we just recently, actually, this quarter, we had all of our international clients together at an event. And the topic is about their transformation. It\u2019s about their HCM transformation and the partnership that we have with them to solve for them. And I think the beauty of ADP is that we have the ability to solve the MNC, the multi-country piece. And we also have the ability to solve the in-country. And a lot of times, for clients, it\u2019s a mix of both. And so it\u2019s really about the flexibility we have in our partnership options to serve these clients in a very unique way. So, we have leaned into the down market in terms of the investments we have made. So, when I think I referenced earlier the seller headcount as we head into the final stretch here and how pleased we are with the investments we have made in headcount and the ecosystem around them, so investments into the channels, things of that nature. And as all of that turns into more productivity because the headcount is actually gaining tenure. It is primarily setting those investments have been in the down-market. So again, think our SPF platform, the retirement services, insurance services, most of that also comes into our digital sales organization, also known as the inside sales. So, we are making investments into inside sales to really serve the down market. And what I would suggest is that from our viewpoint at this point, the demand is there. We have leaned into that demand and we will continue to lean into the demand to drive the growth that we are driving out of the down-market as long as it exists, if you will. Yes. Thank you, Tien-Tsin. I am actually \u2013 I am thrilled you asked this question because I was counting on it during this call because it definitely seems like it\u2019s the topic du jour. But the real answer is, just like everybody else, we are incredibly excited about generative AI. We have been very excited about AI for quite some time. You mentioned what we have been doing for our sellers in the PEO, that\u2019s broad-based work that we have been doing for a long time and continued to invest in AI into making us more efficient. That example is about our sellers. We are making similar investments even with the new technologies that are out there to really look at how we can make our service associates as well as our sellers more productive. So, you think about all the things that an agent, if you will, does today to support a client and some of the generative AI tools that can drive a different level of efficiency. And we are very excited. We have I think it\u2019s something around like 44 different work streams that are underway currently to take a look at different ways that we can leverage these tools internally. That\u2019s also notwithstanding the opportunity that it creates for our industry, right. So, if you think about the HCM industry, there are still very many things inside of HCM that are administrative in nature in terms of whether it\u2019s job descriptions, performance reviews, things that are maybe handbook, things that are very tactical that really a time pulled back the practitioner from doing what they want to do, which is be a strategic partner. And so we are really excited to put these tools also into our product for our clients and our practitioners to be able to lean into. So, all that said, we are very excited about the opportunity. One thing I would point out because it\u2019s important, and it\u2019s also very topical right now, which is that the good news is we have been doing a lot of this work. And as such, we have standards. We have a way to think about the ethical nature and that kind of comes at parity with who we are, given that we have the big data, if you will, behind ADP and the 40 million wage earners that we pay. And so when we think about all of this, also with the lens of doing it the right way and making sure that it\u2019s applicable, it\u2019s secure, it\u2019s compliance, all the things that you would expect from ADP. But no doubt, Tien-Tsin, that we are excited about the opportunity it creates for us internally and the opportunity that it creates for us and our product to really serve the industry, right, and make this entire industry that much more strategic and not much more exciting. So, great question. Thank you. So, first and foremost, thank you everybody for joining today. Really appreciate the questions and the interest. As you can imagine, I sit here one quarter into my new role as CEO and I get a lot of questions. Just last night, I got another text that said, how were the first 100 days, how is the first quarter, what have you been up to? And here is what I would offer. The third quarter for ADP, and you heard it in my tone today, you have heard it in my excitement about some of the volumes and the throughput, but the third quarter is really where you see ADP shine. And it is our finest quarter. You have year-end, you have busy season, you have selling season that all kind of come together. In this quarter, what I would say is adding some economic strangeness and questions about what\u2019s happening in the world, and I would say that sitting here one quarter in, I couldn\u2019t be more excited. I couldn\u2019t be more pleased. I couldn\u2019t be more grateful for the share execution of our associates. So, I felt the breadth and depth of ADP this quarter at its finest. And with that, I just want to take another minute to thank our associates for everything that they do to power this great company. I would also like to thank all of our partners and stakeholders and everyone on the call listening today. I couldn\u2019t be more proud and more excited about this company. And with that, we will wrap up the call."

            "name": "Don McGuire",
            "content": "Thank you, Maria and good morning everyone. I will provide some more details on our Q3 results and update you on our fiscal \u201823 outlook before briefly touching on fiscal \u201824. Let me jump straight into the segments, starting with Employer Services. ES segment revenue increased 11% on a reported basis and 12% on an organic constant currency basis, which is the strongest ES revenue growth we have experienced in quite some time. As Maria shared, ES new business bookings were solid and kept us on track with our full year outlook. We believe the full range of bookings outcomes is still on the table given the relative importance of Q4 bookings to our full year results. So we are not making any change to our guidance, but we do believe the middle of our guidance range feels most likely at this point. On ES retention, following another quarter of better-than-expected results, we are again revising our outlook and we now expect retention to be down only 10 to 20 basis points for the full year compared to our prior outlook of down 20 to 30 basis points. This again will be driven by retention decline in our down market from normalized out-of-business losses and is mostly offset by improved overall retention elsewhere. Pays per control remained strong in Q3 and we are raising our outlook to now assume about 4% pays per control growth for the year compared to our prior outlook for 3% to 4% growth. Client funds interest revenue increased in Q3 in line with our expectations and we are updating our full year outlook utilizing the latest forward yield curve, which in this case resulted in no major change. And on FX, we had about 1 percentage point of ES revenue headwinds in Q3 and there is no change to our outlook for a full year headwind of between 1% and 2%. Following our strong Q3 ES revenue growth, we are pleased to be raising our outlook once again to now expect about 9% growth, up from 8% to 9% before. Our ES margin increased 80 basis points in Q3, which was in line with our expectations. We are narrowing our full year outlook to now expect about 200 basis points of margin expansion and we still see significant opportunity to invest in sales, product and elsewhere throughout the organization to capitalize on the growth opportunity in front of us, which we are choosing to do at this juncture. Moving on to the PEO, we had 5% revenue growth driven by 3% growth in average works on employees. As a reminder, this deceleration is driven by a few factors, including slow pays per control growth, difficult comparisons versus record retention levels and softer recent bookings growth that we experienced the last 2 years. For this fiscal year, we now expect PEO revenue growth of about 8% with growth in average works on employees of about 6%, both at the lower end of our prior ranges. Maria mentioned the bookings reacceleration in Q3 and we are feeling upbeat about reaccelerating the revenue growth in the coming several quarters. This guidance update is mainly due to a tweak to our pays per control assumption within the PEO as it decelerated a bit more than we previously assumed, somewhat different from what we experienced in the ES segment. We are separately lowering our outlook for revenue, excluding zero margin pass-throughs to a range of 7% to 8% due mainly to lower SUI rates in Q3 than we previously anticipated. PEO margin increased 140 basis points in Q3, which was better than expected due primarily to continued favorable workers\u2019 compensation reserve adjustments, which we had not assumed as well as the lower SUI costs I just mentioned and we are raising our outlook for PEO margin to now expect it to be up 50 to 75 basis points for fiscal \u201823. Putting it altogether, we still expect consolidated revenue growth of 8% to 9% in fiscal \u201823, but now believe it will be towards the higher end of that range. We are maintaining our outlook for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 125 to 150 basis points and for a fiscal \u201823 effective tax rate of about 23%. And we now expect adjusted EPS growth of 16% to 17% and compared to our prior outlook of 15% to 17%. I also want to provide some early high level color on what to expect for next year. We are still going through our annual planning process, but there are a few things to consider at this point. First, assuming a slowing economic backdrop, pays per control could be at a below normal growth rate next year, among other potential macro considerations. I would also point out that while client funds interest appears positioned to give us some contribution to growth, based on the latest forward yield curve, it will likely be very modest. At the same time, we have good momentum in our ES bookings performance and ES retention and we are feeling upbeat about the continued opportunity to build on our decades of success. Thank you. And I\u2019ll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A. Yes, Brian, good morning. Thank you for the question. It\u2019s still early. We are still in the middle of our planning process. I think we have a lot of things going in our favor sales. We are \u2013 we still have relatively high client fund interest. Pays per control have been good and strong. Bookings continue to be strong as we said earlier. So as we get into \u201824, I think we are going to be in a pretty healthy spot with what we know today. I guess the challenge we all have is trying to guess what\u2019s coming in terms of the broader macro situation. We continue to see strong demand. Retention continues to be pretty good, although it\u2019s normalizing a little bit in the down market as we did expect. But I think things feel pretty good at this juncture. So I am going to have to ask you to bear with us a little bit as we make our way through our plan and we stay tuned to what\u2019s going on in the macro environment even closer as we get forward or closer to our July 1 beginning of the year. So the \u2013 we did have, as you mentioned, we had a particularly strong PEO bookings month in March, which we are optimistic is going to continue and help us as we go forward. Certainly, we are going to have to see how those bookings continue through the balance of the year, trying to anticipate how those are going to actually result in revenue. Things do start relatively quickly in the PEO business, but it\u2019s going to take some time once again to see how that stuff rolls from bookings into revenue. But we are pretty optimistic about how things went in the third quarter, especially with the finish and we do expect to see that reacceleration as quickly as we want to. And by the way, back to your earlier question a little bit, we talked about high single-digit growth in our mid-term view and we won\u2019t be happy if we don\u2019t get something like that. Yes, thanks for the question. The biggest impact, I guess, in terms of growth would be we are going to continue to see strong growth from client fund interest in the fourth quarter. But certainly, Q3 is by far the strongest quarter just given the seasonality of tax receipts, etcetera, for us. So I think that would be one of the key drivers. And of course, we did mention as well that we expect to see pays per control growth coming down and softening a little bit, even though a bit higher than we expected to see. Last quarter, it is coming down. It\u2019s certainly starting to moderate. Yes. So on the modeling side, roughly a 1% change in ES bookings growth impacts us in the $17 million to $20 million annually on revenue growth. So that\u2019s kind of how we think about your models. I think that\u2019s been pretty consistent. Yes, Kartik, it\u2019s a good question. So certainly, talked about pays per control growth decelerating. We called that out. And we\u2019ve also \u2013 I mentioned earlier, for \u201824, I think there is a risk that it decelerates further. So we will have to watch and see what happens there. On the inflation side and pricing, we\u2019re still in the early days of our FY \u201824 plan. So we\u2019re watching it carefully. I think we can say that we are happy with the impact of the results of the price pricing decisions we took in \u201823. We had those readily accepted, I guess, with \u2013 reflected by our higher NPS scores by our continued strong retention. So we have an ability to take price. But as we always come back to, we\u2019re in this for the long haul with our clients, their long-term retention is the most important thing to us. So we need to make sure that we continue to have that good value proposition between what the absolute prices, how much price we can take, etcetera. But once again, Kartik, it\u2019s definitely something we\u2019re looking at and trying to evaluate as we get closer to putting the plan to bid. Yes. Maybe I will jump in. I think in terms of verticals, certainly seeing all the reports and reading all the things about commercial real estate that everyone else is. That\u2019s \u2013 we look at the breadth and the distribution of our client base, it\u2019s pretty broad. So, I am not so sure that we are seeing any particular verticals that are causing us any undue concern at this time. I would say, has been reported, Maria mentioned it in the prepared remarks, certainly, the enterprise space, the up-market space is where there has been a lot more layoffs announced, etcetera particularly in tech. So, we are looking at that. We have said in the past though that\u2019s not the biggest part of our business. So, even though there is some more softness in that end of the market, it\u2019s being more than offset by the success we are having in the down in the mid-market. So, from a particular vertical, nothing in particular. Yes. I think there is a couple of things going on. One, certainly, we are continuing to benefit from bookings growth, retention, price pays per controllers all a little bit stronger. And we certainly are getting lots of tailwinds. We have lots of tailwinds in Q3, in particular, from client fund interest. So, that\u2019s been very helpful for us. The things slow a little bit from a client from an interest perspective in Q4. So, that certainly is not as helpful as it was. And we are of course, as Maria just mentioned, we are taking advantage of some of those extra flow funds that we have to invest \u2013 reinvest in the business or continue to invest in the business on modernization. So, it\u2019s all about I think trying to find the right balance and still delivering the \u2013 as we mentioned, higher end of the earnings per share prediction or guidance. So, it\u2019s all to find the right balance, and we will continue to invest in modernization and deliver improvements as we go forward. But those are the two impacts. So, the biggest impact was the reserve adjustment on workers\u2019 comp. And the other big item there is the lower SUI costs. So, there is virtually no margins on SUI. So, SUI comes down at the top, it certainly improves the margins. So, those would be the two major impacts on the margin improvement in PEO. We have had that strategy in place for some 20 years or so. And we have realized about $2.8 billion of incremental benefit from that strategy. And so we have a strategy in place. We always revisit these strategies and look at them. It\u2019s true that the yield curve is inverted for the seventh time in 50 years. How long that continues, not sure. But we will continue to look at that strategy and see what we need to do, if anything, to change it as we go forward. But it is something we have been committed to and we followed closely. Near-term, certainly we have benefited this quarter because of the inflow of funds in calendar Q1, there is a big balance or a big benefit there to us. So, as we go forward, we will continue to look at the opportunities and decide if we need to make any material changes to the investment strategy."

I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanyal Hussain: Thank you, Michelle, and welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I'll turn it over now to Maria.\nMaria Black: Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone for joining us. ADP delivered strong Q2 results headlined by 10% organic constant currency revenue growth; 120 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion; and 19% adjusted EPS growth. We continue to deliver exceptional value in the HCM market as we invest in ourselves and innovate to continuously meet and exceed the changing needs of our more than 1 million diverse global clients. I'll start with some highlights from the quarter. In Q2, we drove very strong ES new business bookings growth, which included an incredible finish in December. We have continued to see robust demand across our downmarket portfolio and our ES HRO offerings and our international sales performance, especially our GlobalView platform was much stronger in Q2 after a softer Q1. Overall, we are pleased with our sales results for the first half of the year, and although clients are still dealing with a number of uncertainties, our pipelines are healthy, and we feel well staffed, and well positioned to deliver solid bookings growth for the remainder of the year. Our ES retention was once again a source of outperformance with modest year-on-year improvement in Q2 overall despite continued normalization in down market out of business rates. This strong result was just shy of the record retention set during the pandemic and was led by our mid-market, our upmarket, and international businesses. And we're pleased to be taking our full year guidance up slightly. Our pays per control metric was 5% for the quarter, decelerating slightly from Q1 as we had anticipated. Job growth in the U.S. labor market has been slowing, but clearly remains solid, which you see reflected in our client base. Despite recent headlines noting job cuts by number of companies, we have yet to see broad-based softening in the labor market. Last, on our PEO, our growth in average worksite employees was solid at 8%. While we have been expecting growth to decelerate over the course of this year, the pace was a bit faster than we previously assumed and we're adjusting our outlook accordingly. With that said, demand for the PEO solution remains healthy. The secular growth opportunity is unchanged, and we are well positioned to reaccelerate our worksite employee growth. Stepping back from the quarter, I want to provide a quick update on our broader strategy. Over the last several years, you've heard us talk a lot about the modernization of our products. Our simpler user experience enhances ease of use for our key platforms like RUN and Workforce Now, and enables a more seamless integration to complementary solutions like insurance, retirement and payments. Our Next Gen Payroll engine is a prime example of how we're modernizing the back-end of our solutions, and we continue to offer it to a broader set of new mid-market clients. And brand new solutions like Roll in our Next Gen HCM platform position us to address certain HCM opportunities more fully than before. These product enhancements are designed to drive win rates and retention even higher, and we have tremendous opportunity in front of us. But our strategy has always been about much more than just offering HCM software. ADP clients want us to help them find, hire, pay, engage, and provide for the retirement of their workers in a thoughtful and compliant way. To truly solve for these needs, we are modernizing all aspects of the client relationship. That starts with product, but also extends to our go-to-market approach, how we onboard our clients, and even how we advise and support them on critical issues. We refer to this collective effort as our Modernization Journey. And as with our product journey, the opportunities here are incredible. We are removing friction and enhancing the client experience in many ways. In our U.S. down market, we continue to digitally onboard tens of thousands of clients every year, making onboarding easier for our clients and accelerating time to start. We have seen this success in the U.S. and we're beginning to scale the same capability in Canada. Our Intelligent Self-Service capability launched only last quarter is already helping a portion of our client base answer millions of questions from client employees through a completely automated process. And now in our international portfolio, we're implementing chatbots to reduce work for those clients as well. We continue to invest in our robust partner ecosystem, cultivating deep relationships and integrations with financial advisers, CPAs and benefits brokers to provide a seamless experience for our mutual clients. And we're using the power of our extensive data to deliver insights to bring greater value to clients from better aligning pays to market trends, to reducing the frequency and severity of workers compensation claims, to identifying tax credits and other legislative incentives. To bring this large-scale Modernization Journey to life, I'll speak to one of our fastest-growing businesses. ADP retirement services, which helps employers establish and administer retirement plans. Businesses today face a complex environment with significant legislative change and our clients look to us to help them navigate these changes, stay compliant and address talent challenges. For example, in the retirement space specifically, the recently passed SECURE Act 2.0 alone has over 90 provisions for businesses and employees to consider. And what we've designed makes life easy for our clients and partners, improves the financial wellness of their employees, and sets us apart in the market. Our robust 401(k) solution with thousands of different investment options is not only clean and intuitive, thanks to our new UX framework, but is also deeply integrated with RUN and Workforce Now. Our highly tenured, licensed, retirement services sales force understands our clients and understands which solutions to make a meaningful difference in a client's unique talent strategy. To expand on our partnerships with financial advisers, we recently developed a platform called Advisor Access, much like the Accountant Connect platform we developed for the CPA community years ago. This positions us better to serve our mutual clients and their employees. And our tax credit team, full of experts in their field, is there to help our clients or their CPAs apply for, and obtain the appropriate legislative incentives. Our goal in our Modernization Journey is to consistently improve the full end-to-end experience for our clients and their employees, which will in turn contribute to our long-term sustainable growth and profitability. We look forward to keeping you updated. And now over to Don.\nDon McGuire: Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some more color on our results for the quarter and update you on our fiscal '23 outlook. Overall, we had a strong Q2 on both revenue and margins. If I can summarize, we had generally positive developments in our ES segment despite some incremental headwinds. Meanwhile, trends were a little softer than expected in our PEO. Let me focus on ES first, and I'll cover our results and outlook all at once. ES segment revenue increased 8% on a reported basis and 10% on an organic constant currency basis which was a good outcome for the quarter. Maria mentioned the strong new business bookings performance in Q2. Given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty, we think it's prudent to maintain our current guidance range for now, although, we feel well positioned for the back half. We also had near-record ES retention in Q2, with first half ES retention results up year-on-year, we're now revising our outlook and we expect retention to be down only 20 basis points to 30 basis points for the full year. This continues to assume normalization in out-of-business losses in our downmarket. Pays per control were in line with our expectation in Q2, but with better line of sight on Q3, we are now assuming less of a deceleration in pays per control over the back half than we did previously and are raising our outlook to now assumed 3% to 4% pays per control growth for the year. And on FX, we had about two percentage points of revenue headwind in Q2, but the outlook for the rest of the year is slightly improved, and we now expect full year headwind somewhere between 1% and 2%. Those are the bigger positive developments in ES revenue. There were few developments in the other direction as well. Client funds interest revenue was up nicely in Q2, but was actually a bit lighter than we had planned. This is primarily because yields pulled back slightly from where they were three months ago when we provided our prior outlook. We're also tweaking down our balance growth assumption now to 4% to 5% growth for the year due primarily to assumptions around average wage related to worker mix, tax rates as well as the impact of the lapping of the payroll tax deferral. Together, we are lowering the full year by $5 million at the midpoint for revenue and $15 million at the midpoint for net impact to our earnings. We also saw underperformance in some of our volume-based businesses like our recruitment outsourcing business and our employment verification business. Overall, though, we're feeling good about our ES revenue growth trajectory and are taking up our guidance by 1% to now expecting growth of 8% to 9% for the year. Our ES margin was up 170 basis points in Q2, which was in line with our expectations and there was no change for our full year outlook. As a reminder, we've invested in headcount in sales, product and other areas throughout the organization over the last several quarters as we see continued opportunity to win new clients and further increase satisfaction with existing clients. And although we may scale back as appropriate, at a high level, we feel comfortable with our staffing levels against the secular growth opportunity in front of us. Moving on to the PEO. We delivered 11% PEO revenue growth in Q2 with 8% growth in average worksite employees. As Maria shared, the PEO results came in a bit softer than expected. The PEO business continues to benefit from long-term tailwinds, but there was a lingering effect from the pandemic, which is still adding variability to our PEO results and outlook. We are, for example, lapping very strong results on retention, bookings and same-store pays. And while the overall trends are playing out consistent with our expectations, we continue to refine our assumptions about pays and magnitude. With that said, we still see a continued solid demand environment in the PEO and the team remains focused on reaccelerating worksite employee growth. For this fiscal year, we are lowering our PEO revenue outlook to 8% to 9%, driven by growth in average worksite employees of about 6% to 7%. PEO margin in Q2 was up 130 basis points about in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect PEO margin to be flat to up 25 basis points for fiscal 2023. Adding it all up, the favorable revision to our ES revenue outlook is largely offset by our lighter PEO revenue growth forecast. And so we continue to expect consolidated revenue growth of 8% to 9% in fiscal '23. We also maintain our outlook for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 125 basis points to 150 basis points. We still expect our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate to be about 23%. And we continue to expect adjusted EPS growth of 15% to 17%, supported by our steady share repurchases. I'll just make one quick comment on cadence. We expect consolidated revenue growth to be relatively steady in Q3 from where we were in Q2. We expect margin expansion to be a bit more modest compared to what we experienced in Q2, closer to 50 basis points to 75 basis points of expansion. There were a few reasons, including the lapping of a onetime item last year, comparisons from a headcount perspective, and certain investments in sales and marketing that we're assuming for Q3. Again, there's no major change contemplated for the full year, but hopefully, this helps you think about Q3. Thank you, and I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. On PEO, you mentioned the lingering effects from the pandemic is having an impact. But I was just curious, is the macro environment and I guess, labor market trends impacting PEO differently than ES? Is there more -- is it a question of sensitivity to small versus large market clients? Is it vertical exposure? Or is this really something you see is as quite transient?\nMaria Black: Thank you, Ramsey. I appreciate the question. So I'll try to cover all the ground on the PEO that you asked about. So specifically, what we saw with respect to the first half, we did see, as mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did see that booking did come in softer. We saw that retention came in a bit softer as well than our expectations. In terms of the lingering effect that we cited, all of our businesses had an impact from the pandemic. I would say the PEO is probably the one that had the most impact. If you think about all the drivers that constitute the PEO, it's everything from average wages to worker mix to paid unemployment to certainly the lines of insurance, workers' compensation and health benefits. So I would say it's the business that had the most impact as the pandemic came into the business. And as the pandemic gets flushing out, it is having a lingering effect on the business. I think you touched on what we're seeing with respect to pays per control in the PEO in the context of ES. But I would say is, pays per control is -- the growth rate is decelerating in the PEO. That was expected. If it contributes to the slighter softer performance in the first half and is contributing to the second half. But the two main drivers really behind the performance in the first half as well as the outlook for the second half are bookings and retention. One thing I would say, though, because I want to go back to the strength of that business. We have incredible faith in that business as it relates to the growth from a long-term outlook perspective. The demand is still there. In absolute form from a bookings perspective, the PEO did have growth year-on-year, albeit it was softer than ES and softer than our expectations.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. That was super helpful. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up for me. Tech layoffs have been -- tech sector layoffs have been in the headline recently. I know you guys have a very diversified business, but I thought I'd ask anyway. How exposed are you to that particular vertical? Are you feeling any kind of acute impact from all those headlines kind of layoffs in the technology sector?\nDon McGuire: Yes, Ramsey, it's a good question. I think it's hard to avoid all the headlines that we're seeing day in, day out. And it's fair to say that there's been a number of large names that have announced major layoffs, I'd also with the -- tough to say that some of those clients are -- or some of those people making those layoffs are our clients. But those layoffs are happening around the world in some cases, they're not necessarily our clients in all of our markets. So I think it's fair to say that we have yet to see any significant impact from all those announcements. And I guess I'll just round it out by saying, we're still seeing stronger or strong demand. We've taken up our pays per control assumption for the back half. And we're doing that not just on our own internal perspective, but we're also looking at the BLS reports, the JOLTS reports. Everywhere you look continues to suggest that there's still strong demand for employment. Unemployment continues to be very low. Unemployment applications are still in record lows. They're not increasing. So the macro environment continues to be very, very favorable for us, irrespective of some of those headlines that we're seeing.\nRamsey El-Assal: Perfect. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nEugene Simuni: Thank you very much. Hi, Maria and Don. I wanted to ask about ES bookings. So it sounds like a positive commentary, strong performance there. I think you called out international as coming back strong versus last quarter and also downmarket. Can you talk a little bit about the mid-market? How are the trends there? And yes, I think the key question in everybody's mind is, are you seeing any signs of macro pressure on bookings as companies potentially pulling back their tech spending?\nMaria Black: We were very pleased with our overall new business bookings for the second quarter. Definitely saw an acceleration in pipelines. I'll get the pipelines in a minute. I did cite the downmarket, the strength that we're seeing in the downmarket, that's really our entire downmarket portfolio. So thinking about our -- obviously, our RUN offering, but all the things that tether off of the RUN offer, which is the retirement services that I spoke to at length during the prepared remarks, Insurance Services. We did see strength in Employer Services HRO. And then last but not least, one of the other things that I was most pleased to see was the bounce back in international in the second quarter, both in pipelines as well as results. And that was, as mentioned really in our GlobalView space. So very happy with the results, very happy with the strengthening of pipelines. That's what gives us confidence, stepping into the back half as we think about heading toward our guidance of 6% to 9%. In terms of -- I think you also wanted to know about the mid-market because I didn't cite that specifically. We had very solid yes, very solid mid-market sales, and we continue to see the demand there as a byproduct that is certainly not getting easier for anyone to be an employer, both from a legislative perspective as well as a talent perspective. We have incredible strength in that business as it relates to the product investments we've made. So think about user experience to what we're attaching with the Next Generation Payroll engine. So we made good product enhancements. We had strong NPS. We have incredible retention results. So the mid-market in general had also a solid sales performance. What I would say is, as you contemplate the mid-market, don't forget that Employer Services HRO, the offer that we call Comprehensive Services fits squarely in that market, and that's an area that experienced tremendous growth during the pandemic, and that growth has sustained and is exceeding the overall Employer Services growth. So altogether, the net results for the mid-market are very, very solid for us.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Got it. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up for me on pays per control. Your number was very strong this quarter we thought, out from your expectations. But also keeps outperforming by 1 point or 2, kind of the broad measures of labor market growth in the U.S. like nonfarm payrolls. Remind us what's the driver of that? And how sustainable is that as the overall labor market slows down? Can you maintain that one to two point premium?\nDon McGuire: Yes, it's a good question. But just to remind everyone that, that number is really a mid-market number. So we focus on the mid-market when we provide that pays per control number. And it has been strong. As I mentioned in the earlier answer with respect to the macro environment, the labor market continues to be strong. We're continuing to see our existing clients add employees. As Maria said, bookings are strong. And I think it's the kind of the $64,000 question about how long the labor market can continue to grow. Unemployment can stay so low as we look at some of the headlines and will those things start to converge at some point in the future. But for now, I think we're comfortable with what we've done in terms of taking up the pays per control growth for the back half.\nDanyal Hussain: And Eugene, just to your point about that spread, having existed in the past, I think typically, we would have expected 2% to 3% pays per control growth in normal economic environment, and that compares to maybe 1% to 2% total employment growth. And that's a function of our clients in general being perhaps a bit healthier than the overall economy, but also the fact that total labor includes things like bankruptcies and new business formation. So it's a slightly different take on employment.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to quickly just revisit a little bit, I think you touched on it. But retention and it's an area where we had at least been expecting to see some normalization but -- especially from a company perspective, but it seems to continue to improve or tighten. Obviously, you made technology advancements, et cetera, but what are some other areas, if any, that you'd point to -- that are helping drive that retention performance.\nMaria Black: Sure. Thanks, James. With respect to retention, we are very, very pleased by the strength that we've seen year-to-date. We cited, at the end of the first quarter, we had record retention. The second quarter was near record. If you look at the first half, it was a record. So we're very proud of the -- not to be a broken record, but the record retention and the strength that we saw -- and we believe that, it is a byproduct of the investments. I alluded to the investments we've made into the mid-market, as an example of the user experience. That's broad-based now across the RUN platform, our mobile app, our international offer, where we're also in international seeing record retention. So we believe a lot of these things are anchored in just really driving a better user experience, driving the product into a better place. I think the other is NPS. We have strong service results that's broad-based across the portfolio. I think we generated a tremendous amount of goodwill and value during the pandemic and how we chose to service our clients. And I think that value is -- has continued, and we see that in the results on the NPS side. So I think that's another place. You did touch on normalization. I think it's an important point to make. We do believe at this point, specifically in the down market, I think we even touched on it during the prepared remarks. We do believe that retention has normalized. When we normalize for average or adjust for average size client, we are back to the downmarket really having out of business and bankruptcies back to fiscal '18, fiscal '19 levels. So we do believe that the downmarket has normalized. So again, back to kind of the broader retention picture, it is a very strong one for us because we believe at this point, that is broad-based. And it's really a result of the investments and the service levels that we offer.\nJames Faucette: So Maria, that's an interesting point that you're already kind of at least what you think were -- where we should be from a attrition perspective, et cetera, at least compared to where we were pre-COVID. What are you seeing now from the competitive environment, especially, as we see companies expressing more concern. Are you seeing flight to quality versus some of the regional players or newer entrants? Is that helping you? Just love an update of how the competitive environment factors into what you're seeing overall?\nMaria Black: The competitive environment is certainly -- on one hand, I could say it continues to evolve. On the other hand, I would tell you, if there's nothing really new to report. I think what we're seeing and we look very closely at our balance of trade, we look very closely at our win rate. We're measuring all these investments that we make and whether or not they're impacting things such as our balance of trade and such as our win rate. And what I would offer is that, there is a direct correlation between the places we're investing, whether that's the downmarket and our go-to-market brands, headcounts or in the mid-market into the product and the next-generation suite and the win rates that we have. And so we do believe that we're getting stronger in terms of our offer. And I think the record retention is a direct correlation to that.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maria, you mentioned there was a modernization initiative. I'm wondering if you can expand a little bit on that, just in terms of what we should expect over the next six to 18 months in terms of new offerings or increased offerings. And how would that end up impacting both from a revenue as well as from expense perspective? How should we think about that?\nMaria Black: Sure. I love speaking about the investments we're making into the Modernization Journey. And so perhaps, I can offer the story around the next generation and how we're thinking about the impact of that over the next 16, 18 months from a revenue perspective. And maybe, Don, if you want to cover the margin side. So Mark, as it relates to our overall modernization initiatives, there is all the things that I talked about in the prepared remarks, which is around tools, technology, removing friction, taking work out. Last quarter alone, we talked about Intelligent Self-Service, Voice of the Employee. So these are bespoke features, functionality that were layering into our offers, and into our platforms to make them more competitive and bring more value to the market. With respect to the next generation platforms, I touched briefly on Next Generation HCM. We've given updates of that over time. And I think we continue to see us implement our backlog, continue to build scale, build implementation. Our goal would be -- to use your time horizon over the next 16 to 18 months that we would open the aperture to have that suite specifically sold across a broader set of the upmarket clients. In terms of the Next Generation Payroll, which is what we are offering attached to Workforce Now in the mid-market. We continue to make progress on Next Generation Payroll, pretty excited about that progress from a quarter perspective. Every quarter, there's an increase of the number of clients that we are attaching the Next Gen Payroll towards Workforce Now. So I think from Q4 to Q1, we had more. From Q1 to Q2 -- or Q2 to Q1, we had more. As continue again to attach more and more, we're running about 30% to 40% attached. So again, using your time frames over the next 16 -- six to 18 months, our goal would be to continue to more broadly offer and scale that offering across specifically, our mid-market. We're seeing, again, great signs on win rates, things like that. I think the other initiative I would speak to is Roll. Very excited about our project that we -- or it's not project, our product that we call Roll, which is really the downmarket product that we're offering to an incremental buyer that digital native. And so again, it's exceeding all of its project milestones. We're learning. We're continuing to understand how a digital buyer wants to consume payroll end-to-end in a digital capacity. And we believe over the next six to 18 months that we will learn more and as such, we will scale it across. In terms of the impacts to revenue, I would tell you, revenue over the next six to 18 months, I'm not sure that any of those projects will make a meaningful impact to the revenue. They certainly will make any meaningful impact to bookings. And as we onboard those clients, that will generate new revenue lines for us, whether that's an upmarket, our Next Gen HCM, it's a broader piece to the mid-market, our Next Gen Payroll. And then in the downmarket in the micro market that Roll addresses, it take a lot of units for it to make a meaningful revenue impact to the broader ADP. But that's the -- the excitement is really in the offers, and offers being able to drive win rates and retention and changing the competitive narrative. So with that, I'll kind of stop and I'll let Don speak to any margin impact.\nDon McGuire: Yes, Mark, I'll just follow up on Maria's comments. I think the adoption of these products is exciting and doing well. And as we have the adoption increase quarter-to-quarter, we expect to see improvements in revenue from these new offers. But I think at the same time, the penetration rate within our 1 million existing clients is going to take some time to achieve. So the margin impacts from those new sales and those clients is going to take some time to make its way through to the bottom line, so to speak. But I would say that we -- you've heard us often speak about transformation of these calls over the last few years. And I would say that internally, I think our biggest transformation exercise, our biggest transformation opportunity is coming from these new products themselves. So we are excited about these new offers, and we do think they're going to -- they're going to help us out in the future.\nMark Marcon: That's terrific. Thank you. And then obviously, in the headlines, everybody is concerned about what could potentially occur from a macro perspective in terms of, if we go into a recession, ADP has obviously got a stellar long-term track record of navigating successfully through recessions. But I'm wondering, what's your philosophy going to be Maria, if we go into a recession in terms of thinking about expenses, margins, et cetera. Would you just focus on the long-term or would you do things in a short-term manner to adjust expenses?\nMaria Black: We do have a recession playbook, if you will. I think the first thing that happens is, we adjust things such as our go-to-market. When you think about how we address talent needs on the way up in an economy, it's kind of the converse on the way down. So that's not to suggest that the business wouldn't be impacted. The things that would be impacted are things like bookings. And the reason I bring that up is, it is somewhat self-adjusting, right, as it relates to the action. So in the absence of bookings, there is also the absence of expense. So some of that self-adjust, thinking selling commissions, overall incentive comp. We could also, as a byproduct of that, if there's lower volume on the sales side coming in, we would have lower volume on the implementation side and potentially lower volume on the service side. And so there will be, maybe a pullback in hiring things of that nature. And these are all playbooks that we've run before, a few times in my lifetime. We may add that juncture, choose to prioritize key investments differently, depending on what's happening. But we're going and we're very committed to continuing the work we've been doing on Modernization and on transformation. And I think one of the big lessons for us whether it was this most recent pandemic downturn, if you will, an event or it was the last -- the financial crisis or even the -- I've been here long enough to be a part of the 2000, call it, dot-com, et cetera, bust. And what I would say is, our investments in growth will be maintained. I think that's the key is ensuring that we make smart decisions during a downturn so that when we come out of the downturn, we're positioned to execute quickly. I think we made some very wise decisions, specifically, on the go-to-market, on the seller side during the pandemic that allowed us -- we were lucky because it was short and steep and fast. And as everything opened back up, we were well positioned to take advantage of that market because of the investments that we continue to make. So to answer your question, I think most of the changes that we would make are somewhat self-adjusting in their nature, if bookings were impacted.\nMark Marcon: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. Your line is open.\nBryan Bergin: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. First one I had is on pricing. So just any change in view around ES pricing, any change in claim acceptance to the higher levels that I think you were contemplating when you entered the fiscal year, just given the macro?\nDon McGuire: Yes, Bryan, thanks for the question. I think it's a relatively short answer. The fact is our prices are holding well. As a matter of fact, I would say that we are kind of at the high end of the guidance we gave previously, and we're comfortable with that. I think if we look at our retention, we look at our NPS scores, it appears that those price increases have been understood and accepted as well, as could be expected.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Good to hear. And then on the international front. So can you just talk about what you saw in Europe here that drove the better performance in the quarter. And you cited U.S. pays per control here in the earnings material, what does that imply in the Europe base? So I'm curious not just on the employment level but also the demand, whether there's really any particular solutions that drove that better performance or different underlying behavior in that base versus U.S?\nMaria Black: We were very pleased by the improvement that we saw in international bookings. It was driven mainly by our GlobalView offer and a bit of our in-country business. So very excited about what we saw specifically, as it relates to performance in the second quarter. But also about pipelines, right? So a quarter ago, I was on this call citing that we believe that there was some pipeline depletion that happened specifically in international. So pipelines that were pulled into last fiscal year. International was one of the businesses that had an incredibly strong fourth quarter finish. And so we did see a need during the first quarter to rebuild pipelines. The great news is those pipelines were rebuilt and we saw that execution in the second quarter. It's also what gives us optimism as we head into the back half. So very excited about international. And as optimistic as I am, it is an area that we're still continuing to watch for all the obvious things, I said. Last quarter, which is, there's still the crisis in the Ukraine. There's still the energy crisis. It is also an area that we see a tiny bit of pipeline aging. And so international remains a watch item for us, albeit, very excited about the pipeline build and the results in the second quarter. And I think you asked about pays per control in international?\nDanyal Hussain: Yes. Bryan, pays per control for our international pays tends to be more subdued than what we have in the U.S. in both directions. And so early pandemic, it didn't fall very much at all. And in the recovery, subsequent, we had less growth there. So that's continued.\nDon McGuire: Yes. So just maybe -- so the government programs that are in place and the kind of the social aspect, if you will, of European employment means that things don't go down very quickly. And as a result, they don't recover very quickly as well because they don't have much to recover from. So that's a good for consistency, if you will, continuity of earnings. So that's -- that works in our favor in these -- when times are trying.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Makes sense. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thanks. Thanks so much. Sorry, hope you can hear me. Maria, I think I heard you say you were looking to reposition PEO growth. If that's the case, can you elaborate on that? I'm just trying to think if the implied second half growth in WSE volume within PEO, that's a good number to start from. As we look to next year, could growth get better or worse from there? Or how quickly can the repositioning, benefit of the volume outlook? Thank you.\nMaria Black: The comment that I made was really about bookings. And so we are looking to reaccelerate bookings in the back half. For PEO, as mentioned, it was a bit softer in the first half. In terms of the question of when we anticipate the reacceleration, the well-positioned reacceleration and worksite employee growth, we don't anticipate that it will be in the next couple of quarters. So not a position to necessarily give guidance for next year. But we are lapping -- as mentioned in the remarks, we are lapping record retention, record bookings. And as some of that lapping happens, we believe we're well positioned to reaccelerate works on employee growth into next year.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Got it. Perfect. Thank you. And then just on Retirement Services, since you mentioned it, in your prepared remarks. Any update on penetration there across the major lines? And if there's any change in the outlook or the model there. Thank you.\nMaria Black: Sure. So it's safe to say that business is outperforming its targets. It has great growth. We do have -- and last week, we talked about it, we do have 125,000 plans across that business. It's primarily an SMB space, a little bit into the mid-market and even upmarket. But nonetheless, if you just think of it in the SMB context and with the new SECURE Act and -- which is the 2.0 version of the 1.0 and all the state mandates. At this juncture, we have 125,000 of 800,000-ish RUN clients that take advantage of the offer. So you can kind of think about the opportunity in that way. That's not to suggest that every single one of those RUN clients could be a retirement plan, but even if we were to capture a bit of that. We do believe, and it's part of the reason I'm so excited about it is because it does continue to outperform its growth targets. And we believe there's tremendous runway for growth in Retirement Services over the coming years.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thanks for that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSamad Samana: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask one on the volume-based parts of the businesses that you mentioned, particularly on the employment verification. I was just wondering if you could help us understand how much did that contribute? And what are the assumptions going forward? Are you assuming that there will just be less activity around employment verification? Or do you think it was just seasonally lower? Just how should we think about that since you called it out this quarter.\nDon McGuire: Okay. So let me talk about the two volume businesses that we referenced in the prepared remarks. The first one would be the RPO business, the recruitment outsourcing. That business was down and that business is not a very big business for us. And most of it is focused in the upmarket. Most of the clients we have there are in the enterprise space. And I think that is an area, of course, where we are seeing something internally that correlates more with some of the headlines that we're seeing in the press. But it's not a very big business for us, and it did come down. On the employment verification business, of course, mostly and significantly related to the mortgage market. We don't share the number that EV business is part of our broader $1 billion comprehensive services business. It's meaningful for us. From a revenue perspective, it's more meaningful for us, if you will, from a margin perspective because it's above-average margin business. Hence, we called it out. But our expectations as we look forward is, we do expect there to be softness in the mortgage market in the back half of the year. And we've reflected those expectations and those forecasts into the numbers that we're sharing with you today.\nSamad Samana: Great. And then maybe just a housekeeping question on the rate side. So just so we understand it. When the company gives the forward outlook for the float revenue guidance. Are you assuming -- I'm assuming the tenure that's come in at the short end of the curve has actually gone up. So is it -- should we assume that the tenure at current levels is what you're now forecasting going forward? I'm just trying to -- we're just trying to make sure that we get it correct, the inter-quarter moves and how we should think about that on the guidance of that.\nDon McGuire: Yes. So since we presented -- since we gave guidance last quarter, rates have come down, particularly on the mid and the long rates. And even though short-term rates have increased, some of our short-term borrowing costs in our commercial paper program. So the rates that we're giving and the reason we take in our client fund interest forecast down a little bit at the midpoint, is to reflect those increased borrowing rates and the softening, if you will, of interest rates in the mid and the longer term.\nDanyal Hussain: Yes. Samad, thanks for asking that question because I know we take a slightly different approach than some of our peers. But even when you think about the short end of the yield curve, what is currently baked into market expectations is also what baked into our outlook for the year. So even if the Fed raises rates, that does not necessarily suggest upside to what we had previously guided. And to Don's point, at the longer -- the mid and longer end of the yield curve, you actually saw a decline. And so we share in our earnings release the incremental yield on new purchases and that declined from, I think, 4.3% last quarter to 4.1% this quarter. So in other words, we're getting less in the mid and long end of the yield curve, and we're getting more or less what we expected in the short.\nSamad Samana: Great. That's helpful. Thanks for clarifying that. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey, thanks, guys. I wanted to come back on PEO for a second and maybe piggybacking on Tien-Tsin's question. Just as we think about the second half of the fiscal year. It looks like the revenue growth is going to come in 5%, 6%. And then you talked about getting to some easier comps and some reacceleration. But are you thinking any differently about the medium-term guide for PEO? I think that was 10% to 12% when you provided that at the Analyst Day.\nMaria Black: So the medium-term guide, all of the medium-term guides were somewhat aspirational in their nature, and we're not sitting here today making changes to any of our medium-term guide. I think, again, when I think about the PEO outlook, just a reminder, because I said it earlier on the call, but I think it is an important point. The demand has been incredibly strong still for the PEO. It is still growing nicely through the second quarter. Technically was year-on-year growth. It just wasn't what we had expected, and it decelerated a bit earlier than we thought. And so when we think about kind of the back half of the PEO, we do expect bookings to reaccelerate. As mentioned, we expect works on employees to not accelerate in the coming quarters, but we're well positioned to do so as we lap the compares into next year. But I think the big piece -- by the way, even retention was healthy. Retention is right in line with really where it's been in the last decade. I spent a lot of years in that business. And I've seen this as nothing abnormal, if you will. It's really just the byproduct of some lingering effects from the pandemic, which is not that different than some of the strangeness that we experienced during ACA in that business. And so what I would say is, demand is healthy, bookings is healthy, just not as high as we wanted it to be on tough compares. Retention is healthy, just not as high as we wanted it to be, again, on tough compares. And we feel well positioned in that business to accelerate and very excited about its long-term growth opportunity for us.\nDon McGuire: Yes. Sorry. And at the same time, remember, at Investor Day, we said that we were expecting high single-digit growth in average worksite employees. So I think we're still very much on that track and pretty much committed to that.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Appreciate that. Just wanted to follow up on -- so on the pays per control side, obviously, you upticked the guide there. But we have seen in the temp labor market, there's been some material declines in recent months. I'm just wondering how you guys think about the temp labor market relative to broader labor market conditions. And your business with some kind of potential lag? Just any views there would be helpful. Thanks.\nDanyal Hussain: Yes. Jason, I think --\nDon McGuire: Sorry, I will -- let me start. Maybe Danny can add some color. I think some of the leading indicators we look at -- so look at the JOLTS report, we look at the job postings, et cetera, those still seem to be healthy. It is -- I mean, the open positions, the until positions are certainly declining, but they still remain at healthy levels compared to pre-pandemic levels. So I think that would be an indicator we look at. And I think there's still some room there before they get back to what we saw pre-pandemic. So I guess we'll continue to pay attention to it. We're focused on it. But at this point in time, things still feel to be pretty healthy.\nDanyal Hussain: Yes. Jason, exactly to that point. It's one of many leading indicators that we look at. And for sure, things are slowing, given where we are with employment and 3.5% unemployment rate. So it's not a question of whether we expect the monthly jobs growth to slow over the next several months, I think that's more or less assumed. But the question is, at these employment levels to get that type of growth is still a very healthy outcome. And so I think that's how we would characterize the overall environment today.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Thanks for the color guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: We have time for one more question, and that question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKartik Mehta: Good morning. Maybe Maria or Don, as you look at the PEO business and is -- are you seeing any more competition in the business? Could that be a part of maybe you're seeing? Or is this just that you need to reposition the business a little bit and the business was so strong that the comparisons are difficult.\nMaria Black: I think the business was so strong. I think the compares were difficult. We plan for deceleration. It happened faster. We do not see a competitive change or landscape that exists. Again, in terms of where that business gets its business from, that 50-50 split between kind of new clients coming in as well as upgrades as well as where we actually return clients that leave. Certainly, there is PEO to PEO switching, but it's a very small piece to the overall results on the booking side or the impact on retention. And we're not seeing -- again, we look at balance of trade, we look at win rates and we do not see a meaningful change in the competitive landscape.\nKartik Mehta: And then maybe Don and Danny, I know you're talking about leading indicators and Don, you talked about the JOLTS report, and I assume we have lots of other statistics. But I'm wondering, are you able to look at the customers you have and the demand they see for employees? And if you kind of compare that to what you saw three, six months ago. Are you able to do that? And if so, maybe what you might see in that type of -- those type of statistics?\nDon McGuire: Yes. I mean, I think the way we look at that, Kartik, is through the pays per control growth. And so as we went from 7% growth in Q1 down to 5% and we were looking to be a bit flatter in the back half, although we've become a little bit more optimistic on that as time has gone on. So I think that would be the key area where we kind of take a look and see what the demand is with our installed client base.\nDanyal Hussain: Yes. Beyond that, Kartik, we do have some recruitment solutions beyond the recruitment outsourcing one that Don spoke about earlier. And so we have, for example, data on the total number of job postings that our clients have. And if you were to look back, that would typically track JOLTS, the trends would be very similar. Now that said, clearly, you could be in an environment where people have job postings and then they decide to pull them. So how accurate that is, how great of a leading indicator that is, it's hard to say. But at the same time, we have live data on pays per control as Don points out. So we know with precision how many people are being added week-to-week. That's healthy. The job postings are healthy. Granted there are some signs of deceleration, layoffs and temp, but the bigger picture is still healthy.\nKartik Mehta: Well thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Maria Black for closing remarks.\nMaria Black: Thank you, Michelle, and thank you to all of you on the phone today for your thoughtful questions. As you heard from our tone today, very pleased with the first half, excited about how we're positioned for the second half against our updated guidance. Again, everything that we do every day is all about solving for clients in the world of work. And with that, I think it'd be appropriate for me to thank the 60,000 plus associates that are out there every day doing that work for our clients, for their workers and bringing meaningful value into the world of work and into the world of HCM. So thank you to all the associates. Thanks to all the analysts and the investors for your support and your continued support. We certainly appreciate it and we look forward to keeping you updated and speaking with you again soon. Thanks so much.\nOperator: This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

            "name": "Maria Black",
            "content": "Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone for joining us. ADP delivered strong Q2 results headlined by 10% organic constant currency revenue growth; 120 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion; and 19% adjusted EPS growth. We continue to deliver exceptional value in the HCM market as we invest in ourselves and innovate to continuously meet and exceed the changing needs of our more than 1 million diverse global clients. I'll start with some highlights from the quarter. In Q2, we drove very strong ES new business bookings growth, which included an incredible finish in December. We have continued to see robust demand across our downmarket portfolio and our ES HRO offerings and our international sales performance, especially our GlobalView platform was much stronger in Q2 after a softer Q1. Overall, we are pleased with our sales results for the first half of the year, and although clients are still dealing with a number of uncertainties, our pipelines are healthy, and we feel well staffed, and well positioned to deliver solid bookings growth for the remainder of the year. Our ES retention was once again a source of outperformance with modest year-on-year improvement in Q2 overall despite continued normalization in down market out of business rates. This strong result was just shy of the record retention set during the pandemic and was led by our mid-market, our upmarket, and international businesses. And we're pleased to be taking our full year guidance up slightly. Our pays per control metric was 5% for the quarter, decelerating slightly from Q1 as we had anticipated. Job growth in the U.S. labor market has been slowing, but clearly remains solid, which you see reflected in our client base. Despite recent headlines noting job cuts by number of companies, we have yet to see broad-based softening in the labor market. Last, on our PEO, our growth in average worksite employees was solid at 8%. While we have been expecting growth to decelerate over the course of this year, the pace was a bit faster than we previously assumed and we're adjusting our outlook accordingly. With that said, demand for the PEO solution remains healthy. The secular growth opportunity is unchanged, and we are well positioned to reaccelerate our worksite employee growth. Stepping back from the quarter, I want to provide a quick update on our broader strategy. Over the last several years, you've heard us talk a lot about the modernization of our products. Our simpler user experience enhances ease of use for our key platforms like RUN and Workforce Now, and enables a more seamless integration to complementary solutions like insurance, retirement and payments. Our Next Gen Payroll engine is a prime example of how we're modernizing the back-end of our solutions, and we continue to offer it to a broader set of new mid-market clients. And brand new solutions like Roll in our Next Gen HCM platform position us to address certain HCM opportunities more fully than before. These product enhancements are designed to drive win rates and retention even higher, and we have tremendous opportunity in front of us. But our strategy has always been about much more than just offering HCM software. ADP clients want us to help them find, hire, pay, engage, and provide for the retirement of their workers in a thoughtful and compliant way. To truly solve for these needs, we are modernizing all aspects of the client relationship. That starts with product, but also extends to our go-to-market approach, how we onboard our clients, and even how we advise and support them on critical issues. We refer to this collective effort as our Modernization Journey. And as with our product journey, the opportunities here are incredible. We are removing friction and enhancing the client experience in many ways. In our U.S. down market, we continue to digitally onboard tens of thousands of clients every year, making onboarding easier for our clients and accelerating time to start. We have seen this success in the U.S. and we're beginning to scale the same capability in Canada. Our Intelligent Self-Service capability launched only last quarter is already helping a portion of our client base answer millions of questions from client employees through a completely automated process. And now in our international portfolio, we're implementing chatbots to reduce work for those clients as well. We continue to invest in our robust partner ecosystem, cultivating deep relationships and integrations with financial advisers, CPAs and benefits brokers to provide a seamless experience for our mutual clients. And we're using the power of our extensive data to deliver insights to bring greater value to clients from better aligning pays to market trends, to reducing the frequency and severity of workers compensation claims, to identifying tax credits and other legislative incentives. To bring this large-scale Modernization Journey to life, I'll speak to one of our fastest-growing businesses. ADP retirement services, which helps employers establish and administer retirement plans. Businesses today face a complex environment with significant legislative change and our clients look to us to help them navigate these changes, stay compliant and address talent challenges. For example, in the retirement space specifically, the recently passed SECURE Act 2.0 alone has over 90 provisions for businesses and employees to consider. And what we've designed makes life easy for our clients and partners, improves the financial wellness of their employees, and sets us apart in the market. Our robust 401(k) solution with thousands of different investment options is not only clean and intuitive, thanks to our new UX framework, but is also deeply integrated with RUN and Workforce Now. Our highly tenured, licensed, retirement services sales force understands our clients and understands which solutions to make a meaningful difference in a client's unique talent strategy. To expand on our partnerships with financial advisers, we recently developed a platform called Advisor Access, much like the Accountant Connect platform we developed for the CPA community years ago. This positions us better to serve our mutual clients and their employees. And our tax credit team, full of experts in their field, is there to help our clients or their CPAs apply for, and obtain the appropriate legislative incentives. Our goal in our Modernization Journey is to consistently improve the full end-to-end experience for our clients and their employees, which will in turn contribute to our long-term sustainable growth and profitability. We look forward to keeping you updated. And now over to Don. Thank you, Ramsey. I appreciate the question. So I'll try to cover all the ground on the PEO that you asked about. So specifically, what we saw with respect to the first half, we did see, as mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did see that booking did come in softer. We saw that retention came in a bit softer as well than our expectations. In terms of the lingering effect that we cited, all of our businesses had an impact from the pandemic. I would say the PEO is probably the one that had the most impact. If you think about all the drivers that constitute the PEO, it's everything from average wages to worker mix to paid unemployment to certainly the lines of insurance, workers' compensation and health benefits. So I would say it's the business that had the most impact as the pandemic came into the business. And as the pandemic gets flushing out, it is having a lingering effect on the business. I think you touched on what we're seeing with respect to pays per control in the PEO in the context of ES. But I would say is, pays per control is -- the growth rate is decelerating in the PEO. That was expected. If it contributes to the slighter softer performance in the first half and is contributing to the second half. But the two main drivers really behind the performance in the first half as well as the outlook for the second half are bookings and retention. One thing I would say, though, because I want to go back to the strength of that business. We have incredible faith in that business as it relates to the growth from a long-term outlook perspective. The demand is still there. In absolute form from a bookings perspective, the PEO did have growth year-on-year, albeit it was softer than ES and softer than our expectations. We were very pleased with our overall new business bookings for the second quarter. Definitely saw an acceleration in pipelines. I'll get the pipelines in a minute. I did cite the downmarket, the strength that we're seeing in the downmarket, that's really our entire downmarket portfolio. So thinking about our -- obviously, our RUN offering, but all the things that tether off of the RUN offer, which is the retirement services that I spoke to at length during the prepared remarks, Insurance Services. We did see strength in Employer Services HRO. And then last but not least, one of the other things that I was most pleased to see was the bounce back in international in the second quarter, both in pipelines as well as results. And that was, as mentioned really in our GlobalView space. So very happy with the results, very happy with the strengthening of pipelines. That's what gives us confidence, stepping into the back half as we think about heading toward our guidance of 6% to 9%. In terms of -- I think you also wanted to know about the mid-market because I didn't cite that specifically. We had very solid yes, very solid mid-market sales, and we continue to see the demand there as a byproduct that is certainly not getting easier for anyone to be an employer, both from a legislative perspective as well as a talent perspective. We have incredible strength in that business as it relates to the product investments we've made. So think about user experience to what we're attaching with the Next Generation Payroll engine. So we made good product enhancements. We had strong NPS. We have incredible retention results. So the mid-market in general had also a solid sales performance. What I would say is, as you contemplate the mid-market, don't forget that Employer Services HRO, the offer that we call Comprehensive Services fits squarely in that market, and that's an area that experienced tremendous growth during the pandemic, and that growth has sustained and is exceeding the overall Employer Services growth. So altogether, the net results for the mid-market are very, very solid for us. Sure. Thanks, James. With respect to retention, we are very, very pleased by the strength that we've seen year-to-date. We cited, at the end of the first quarter, we had record retention. The second quarter was near record. If you look at the first half, it was a record. So we're very proud of the -- not to be a broken record, but the record retention and the strength that we saw -- and we believe that, it is a byproduct of the investments. I alluded to the investments we've made into the mid-market, as an example of the user experience. That's broad-based now across the RUN platform, our mobile app, our international offer, where we're also in international seeing record retention. So we believe a lot of these things are anchored in just really driving a better user experience, driving the product into a better place. I think the other is NPS. We have strong service results that's broad-based across the portfolio. I think we generated a tremendous amount of goodwill and value during the pandemic and how we chose to service our clients. And I think that value is -- has continued, and we see that in the results on the NPS side. So I think that's another place. You did touch on normalization. I think it's an important point to make. We do believe at this point, specifically in the down market, I think we even touched on it during the prepared remarks. We do believe that retention has normalized. When we normalize for average or adjust for average size client, we are back to the downmarket really having out of business and bankruptcies back to fiscal '18, fiscal '19 levels. So we do believe that the downmarket has normalized. So again, back to kind of the broader retention picture, it is a very strong one for us because we believe at this point, that is broad-based. And it's really a result of the investments and the service levels that we offer. The competitive environment is certainly -- on one hand, I could say it continues to evolve. On the other hand, I would tell you, if there's nothing really new to report. I think what we're seeing and we look very closely at our balance of trade, we look very closely at our win rate. We're measuring all these investments that we make and whether or not they're impacting things such as our balance of trade and such as our win rate. And what I would offer is that, there is a direct correlation between the places we're investing, whether that's the downmarket and our go-to-market brands, headcounts or in the mid-market into the product and the next-generation suite and the win rates that we have. And so we do believe that we're getting stronger in terms of our offer. And I think the record retention is a direct correlation to that. Sure. I love speaking about the investments we're making into the Modernization Journey. And so perhaps, I can offer the story around the next generation and how we're thinking about the impact of that over the next 16, 18 months from a revenue perspective. And maybe, Don, if you want to cover the margin side. So Mark, as it relates to our overall modernization initiatives, there is all the things that I talked about in the prepared remarks, which is around tools, technology, removing friction, taking work out. Last quarter alone, we talked about Intelligent Self-Service, Voice of the Employee. So these are bespoke features, functionality that were layering into our offers, and into our platforms to make them more competitive and bring more value to the market. With respect to the next generation platforms, I touched briefly on Next Generation HCM. We've given updates of that over time. And I think we continue to see us implement our backlog, continue to build scale, build implementation. Our goal would be -- to use your time horizon over the next 16 to 18 months that we would open the aperture to have that suite specifically sold across a broader set of the upmarket clients. In terms of the Next Generation Payroll, which is what we are offering attached to Workforce Now in the mid-market. We continue to make progress on Next Generation Payroll, pretty excited about that progress from a quarter perspective. Every quarter, there's an increase of the number of clients that we are attaching the Next Gen Payroll towards Workforce Now. So I think from Q4 to Q1, we had more. From Q1 to Q2 -- or Q2 to Q1, we had more. As continue again to attach more and more, we're running about 30% to 40% attached. So again, using your time frames over the next 16 -- six to 18 months, our goal would be to continue to more broadly offer and scale that offering across specifically, our mid-market. We're seeing, again, great signs on win rates, things like that. I think the other initiative I would speak to is Roll. Very excited about our project that we -- or it's not project, our product that we call Roll, which is really the downmarket product that we're offering to an incremental buyer that digital native. And so again, it's exceeding all of its project milestones. We're learning. We're continuing to understand how a digital buyer wants to consume payroll end-to-end in a digital capacity. And we believe over the next six to 18 months that we will learn more and as such, we will scale it across. In terms of the impacts to revenue, I would tell you, revenue over the next six to 18 months, I'm not sure that any of those projects will make a meaningful impact to the revenue. They certainly will make any meaningful impact to bookings. And as we onboard those clients, that will generate new revenue lines for us, whether that's an upmarket, our Next Gen HCM, it's a broader piece to the mid-market, our Next Gen Payroll. And then in the downmarket in the micro market that Roll addresses, it take a lot of units for it to make a meaningful revenue impact to the broader ADP. But that's the -- the excitement is really in the offers, and offers being able to drive win rates and retention and changing the competitive narrative. So with that, I'll kind of stop and I'll let Don speak to any margin impact. We do have a recession playbook, if you will. I think the first thing that happens is, we adjust things such as our go-to-market. When you think about how we address talent needs on the way up in an economy, it's kind of the converse on the way down. So that's not to suggest that the business wouldn't be impacted. The things that would be impacted are things like bookings. And the reason I bring that up is, it is somewhat self-adjusting, right, as it relates to the action. So in the absence of bookings, there is also the absence of expense. So some of that self-adjust, thinking selling commissions, overall incentive comp. We could also, as a byproduct of that, if there's lower volume on the sales side coming in, we would have lower volume on the implementation side and potentially lower volume on the service side. And so there will be, maybe a pullback in hiring things of that nature. And these are all playbooks that we've run before, a few times in my lifetime. We may add that juncture, choose to prioritize key investments differently, depending on what's happening. But we're going and we're very committed to continuing the work we've been doing on Modernization and on transformation. And I think one of the big lessons for us whether it was this most recent pandemic downturn, if you will, an event or it was the last -- the financial crisis or even the -- I've been here long enough to be a part of the 2000, call it, dot-com, et cetera, bust. And what I would say is, our investments in growth will be maintained. I think that's the key is ensuring that we make smart decisions during a downturn so that when we come out of the downturn, we're positioned to execute quickly. I think we made some very wise decisions, specifically, on the go-to-market, on the seller side during the pandemic that allowed us -- we were lucky because it was short and steep and fast. And as everything opened back up, we were well positioned to take advantage of that market because of the investments that we continue to make. So to answer your question, I think most of the changes that we would make are somewhat self-adjusting in their nature, if bookings were impacted. We were very pleased by the improvement that we saw in international bookings. It was driven mainly by our GlobalView offer and a bit of our in-country business. So very excited about what we saw specifically, as it relates to performance in the second quarter. But also about pipelines, right? So a quarter ago, I was on this call citing that we believe that there was some pipeline depletion that happened specifically in international. So pipelines that were pulled into last fiscal year. International was one of the businesses that had an incredibly strong fourth quarter finish. And so we did see a need during the first quarter to rebuild pipelines. The great news is those pipelines were rebuilt and we saw that execution in the second quarter. It's also what gives us optimism as we head into the back half. So very excited about international. And as optimistic as I am, it is an area that we're still continuing to watch for all the obvious things, I said. Last quarter, which is, there's still the crisis in the Ukraine. There's still the energy crisis. It is also an area that we see a tiny bit of pipeline aging. And so international remains a watch item for us, albeit, very excited about the pipeline build and the results in the second quarter. And I think you asked about pays per control in international? The comment that I made was really about bookings. And so we are looking to reaccelerate bookings in the back half. For PEO, as mentioned, it was a bit softer in the first half. In terms of the question of when we anticipate the reacceleration, the well-positioned reacceleration and worksite employee growth, we don't anticipate that it will be in the next couple of quarters. So not a position to necessarily give guidance for next year. But we are lapping -- as mentioned in the remarks, we are lapping record retention, record bookings. And as some of that lapping happens, we believe we're well positioned to reaccelerate works on employee growth into next year. Sure. So it's safe to say that business is outperforming its targets. It has great growth. We do have -- and last week, we talked about it, we do have 125,000 plans across that business. It's primarily an SMB space, a little bit into the mid-market and even upmarket. But nonetheless, if you just think of it in the SMB context and with the new SECURE Act and -- which is the 2.0 version of the 1.0 and all the state mandates. At this juncture, we have 125,000 of 800,000-ish RUN clients that take advantage of the offer. So you can kind of think about the opportunity in that way. That's not to suggest that every single one of those RUN clients could be a retirement plan, but even if we were to capture a bit of that. We do believe, and it's part of the reason I'm so excited about it is because it does continue to outperform its growth targets. And we believe there's tremendous runway for growth in Retirement Services over the coming years. So the medium-term guide, all of the medium-term guides were somewhat aspirational in their nature, and we're not sitting here today making changes to any of our medium-term guide. I think, again, when I think about the PEO outlook, just a reminder, because I said it earlier on the call, but I think it is an important point. The demand has been incredibly strong still for the PEO. It is still growing nicely through the second quarter. Technically was year-on-year growth. It just wasn't what we had expected, and it decelerated a bit earlier than we thought. And so when we think about kind of the back half of the PEO, we do expect bookings to reaccelerate. As mentioned, we expect works on employees to not accelerate in the coming quarters, but we're well positioned to do so as we lap the compares into next year. But I think the big piece -- by the way, even retention was healthy. Retention is right in line with really where it's been in the last decade. I spent a lot of years in that business. And I've seen this as nothing abnormal, if you will. It's really just the byproduct of some lingering effects from the pandemic, which is not that different than some of the strangeness that we experienced during ACA in that business. And so what I would say is, demand is healthy, bookings is healthy, just not as high as we wanted it to be on tough compares. Retention is healthy, just not as high as we wanted it to be, again, on tough compares. And we feel well positioned in that business to accelerate and very excited about its long-term growth opportunity for us. I think the business was so strong. I think the compares were difficult. We plan for deceleration. It happened faster. We do not see a competitive change or landscape that exists. Again, in terms of where that business gets its business from, that 50-50 split between kind of new clients coming in as well as upgrades as well as where we actually return clients that leave. Certainly, there is PEO to PEO switching, but it's a very small piece to the overall results on the booking side or the impact on retention. And we're not seeing -- again, we look at balance of trade, we look at win rates and we do not see a meaningful change in the competitive landscape. Thank you, Michelle, and thank you to all of you on the phone today for your thoughtful questions. As you heard from our tone today, very pleased with the first half, excited about how we're positioned for the second half against our updated guidance. Again, everything that we do every day is all about solving for clients in the world of work. And with that, I think it'd be appropriate for me to thank the 60,000 plus associates that are out there every day doing that work for our clients, for their workers and bringing meaningful value into the world of work and into the world of HCM. So thank you to all the associates. Thanks to all the analysts and the investors for your support and your continued support. We certainly appreciate it and we look forward to keeping you updated and speaking with you again soon. Thanks so much."

            "name": "Don McGuire",
            "content": "Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some more color on our results for the quarter and update you on our fiscal '23 outlook. Overall, we had a strong Q2 on both revenue and margins. If I can summarize, we had generally positive developments in our ES segment despite some incremental headwinds. Meanwhile, trends were a little softer than expected in our PEO. Let me focus on ES first, and I'll cover our results and outlook all at once. ES segment revenue increased 8% on a reported basis and 10% on an organic constant currency basis which was a good outcome for the quarter. Maria mentioned the strong new business bookings performance in Q2. Given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty, we think it's prudent to maintain our current guidance range for now, although, we feel well positioned for the back half. We also had near-record ES retention in Q2, with first half ES retention results up year-on-year, we're now revising our outlook and we expect retention to be down only 20 basis points to 30 basis points for the full year. This continues to assume normalization in out-of-business losses in our downmarket. Pays per control were in line with our expectation in Q2, but with better line of sight on Q3, we are now assuming less of a deceleration in pays per control over the back half than we did previously and are raising our outlook to now assumed 3% to 4% pays per control growth for the year. And on FX, we had about two percentage points of revenue headwind in Q2, but the outlook for the rest of the year is slightly improved, and we now expect full year headwind somewhere between 1% and 2%. Those are the bigger positive developments in ES revenue. There were few developments in the other direction as well. Client funds interest revenue was up nicely in Q2, but was actually a bit lighter than we had planned. This is primarily because yields pulled back slightly from where they were three months ago when we provided our prior outlook. We're also tweaking down our balance growth assumption now to 4% to 5% growth for the year due primarily to assumptions around average wage related to worker mix, tax rates as well as the impact of the lapping of the payroll tax deferral. Together, we are lowering the full year by $5 million at the midpoint for revenue and $15 million at the midpoint for net impact to our earnings. We also saw underperformance in some of our volume-based businesses like our recruitment outsourcing business and our employment verification business. Overall, though, we're feeling good about our ES revenue growth trajectory and are taking up our guidance by 1% to now expecting growth of 8% to 9% for the year. Our ES margin was up 170 basis points in Q2, which was in line with our expectations and there was no change for our full year outlook. As a reminder, we've invested in headcount in sales, product and other areas throughout the organization over the last several quarters as we see continued opportunity to win new clients and further increase satisfaction with existing clients. And although we may scale back as appropriate, at a high level, we feel comfortable with our staffing levels against the secular growth opportunity in front of us. Moving on to the PEO. We delivered 11% PEO revenue growth in Q2 with 8% growth in average worksite employees. As Maria shared, the PEO results came in a bit softer than expected. The PEO business continues to benefit from long-term tailwinds, but there was a lingering effect from the pandemic, which is still adding variability to our PEO results and outlook. We are, for example, lapping very strong results on retention, bookings and same-store pays. And while the overall trends are playing out consistent with our expectations, we continue to refine our assumptions about pays and magnitude. With that said, we still see a continued solid demand environment in the PEO and the team remains focused on reaccelerating worksite employee growth. For this fiscal year, we are lowering our PEO revenue outlook to 8% to 9%, driven by growth in average worksite employees of about 6% to 7%. PEO margin in Q2 was up 130 basis points about in line with our expectations, and we continue to expect PEO margin to be flat to up 25 basis points for fiscal 2023. Adding it all up, the favorable revision to our ES revenue outlook is largely offset by our lighter PEO revenue growth forecast. And so we continue to expect consolidated revenue growth of 8% to 9% in fiscal '23. We also maintain our outlook for adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 125 basis points to 150 basis points. We still expect our fiscal 2023 effective tax rate to be about 23%. And we continue to expect adjusted EPS growth of 15% to 17%, supported by our steady share repurchases. I'll just make one quick comment on cadence. We expect consolidated revenue growth to be relatively steady in Q3 from where we were in Q2. We expect margin expansion to be a bit more modest compared to what we experienced in Q2, closer to 50 basis points to 75 basis points of expansion. There were a few reasons, including the lapping of a onetime item last year, comparisons from a headcount perspective, and certain investments in sales and marketing that we're assuming for Q3. Again, there's no major change contemplated for the full year, but hopefully, this helps you think about Q3. Thank you, and I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Yes, Ramsey, it's a good question. I think it's hard to avoid all the headlines that we're seeing day in, day out. And it's fair to say that there's been a number of large names that have announced major layoffs, I'd also with the -- tough to say that some of those clients are -- or some of those people making those layoffs are our clients. But those layoffs are happening around the world in some cases, they're not necessarily our clients in all of our markets. So I think it's fair to say that we have yet to see any significant impact from all those announcements. And I guess I'll just round it out by saying, we're still seeing stronger or strong demand. We've taken up our pays per control assumption for the back half. And we're doing that not just on our own internal perspective, but we're also looking at the BLS reports, the JOLTS reports. Everywhere you look continues to suggest that there's still strong demand for employment. Unemployment continues to be very low. Unemployment applications are still in record lows. They're not increasing. So the macro environment continues to be very, very favorable for us, irrespective of some of those headlines that we're seeing. Yes, it's a good question. But just to remind everyone that, that number is really a mid-market number. So we focus on the mid-market when we provide that pays per control number. And it has been strong. As I mentioned in the earlier answer with respect to the macro environment, the labor market continues to be strong. We're continuing to see our existing clients add employees. As Maria said, bookings are strong. And I think it's the kind of the $64,000 question about how long the labor market can continue to grow. Unemployment can stay so low as we look at some of the headlines and will those things start to converge at some point in the future. But for now, I think we're comfortable with what we've done in terms of taking up the pays per control growth for the back half. Yes, Mark, I'll just follow up on Maria's comments. I think the adoption of these products is exciting and doing well. And as we have the adoption increase quarter-to-quarter, we expect to see improvements in revenue from these new offers. But I think at the same time, the penetration rate within our 1 million existing clients is going to take some time to achieve. So the margin impacts from those new sales and those clients is going to take some time to make its way through to the bottom line, so to speak. But I would say that we -- you've heard us often speak about transformation of these calls over the last few years. And I would say that internally, I think our biggest transformation exercise, our biggest transformation opportunity is coming from these new products themselves. So we are excited about these new offers, and we do think they're going to -- they're going to help us out in the future. Yes, Bryan, thanks for the question. I think it's a relatively short answer. The fact is our prices are holding well. As a matter of fact, I would say that we are kind of at the high end of the guidance we gave previously, and we're comfortable with that. I think if we look at our retention, we look at our NPS scores, it appears that those price increases have been understood and accepted as well, as could be expected. Yes. So just maybe -- so the government programs that are in place and the kind of the social aspect, if you will, of European employment means that things don't go down very quickly. And as a result, they don't recover very quickly as well because they don't have much to recover from. So that's a good for consistency, if you will, continuity of earnings. So that's -- that works in our favor in these -- when times are trying. Okay. So let me talk about the two volume businesses that we referenced in the prepared remarks. The first one would be the RPO business, the recruitment outsourcing. That business was down and that business is not a very big business for us. And most of it is focused in the upmarket. Most of the clients we have there are in the enterprise space. And I think that is an area, of course, where we are seeing something internally that correlates more with some of the headlines that we're seeing in the press. But it's not a very big business for us, and it did come down. On the employment verification business, of course, mostly and significantly related to the mortgage market. We don't share the number that EV business is part of our broader $1 billion comprehensive services business. It's meaningful for us. From a revenue perspective, it's more meaningful for us, if you will, from a margin perspective because it's above-average margin business. Hence, we called it out. But our expectations as we look forward is, we do expect there to be softness in the mortgage market in the back half of the year. And we've reflected those expectations and those forecasts into the numbers that we're sharing with you today. Yes. So since we presented -- since we gave guidance last quarter, rates have come down, particularly on the mid and the long rates. And even though short-term rates have increased, some of our short-term borrowing costs in our commercial paper program. So the rates that we're giving and the reason we take in our client fund interest forecast down a little bit at the midpoint, is to reflect those increased borrowing rates and the softening, if you will, of interest rates in the mid and the longer term. Yes. Sorry. And at the same time, remember, at Investor Day, we said that we were expecting high single-digit growth in average worksite employees. So I think we're still very much on that track and pretty much committed to that. Sorry, I will -- let me start. Maybe Danny can add some color. I think some of the leading indicators we look at -- so look at the JOLTS report, we look at the job postings, et cetera, those still seem to be healthy. It is -- I mean, the open positions, the until positions are certainly declining, but they still remain at healthy levels compared to pre-pandemic levels. So I think that would be an indicator we look at. And I think there's still some room there before they get back to what we saw pre-pandemic. So I guess we'll continue to pay attention to it. We're focused on it. But at this point in time, things still feel to be pretty healthy. Yes. I mean, I think the way we look at that, Kartik, is through the pays per control growth. And so as we went from 7% growth in Q1 down to 5% and we were looking to be a bit flatter in the back half, although we've become a little bit more optimistic on that as time has gone on. So I think that would be the key area where we kind of take a look and see what the demand is with our installed client base."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Michelle, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]  I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danyal Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanyal Hussain: Thank you, Michelle, and welcome, everyone to ADP's first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call. Participating today are Carlos Rodriguez, our CEO; Maria Black, our President; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call.  During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures, can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations.  And with that, let me turn it over to Carlos.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thank you, Danny, and thanks, everybody, for joining the call. As you saw this morning in the news, we have a little bit more excitement than normal, but I promise you that 1.5 hours from now, we'll go back to our boring cells because we do have a business to run.  But before I talk about the quarter, I thought it was appropriate to just share a few thoughts given the transition from me to Maria as our new CEO. As you know, I'm going to continue as Exec Chair, but obviously, that's going to be a role primarily to supporting Maria and also helping the Board and not really involved in day-to-day operations. So it's definitely going to be my last earnings call, which is hard to say because it\u2019s been 44 earnings calls for me. But it's really been an incredible ride.  Obviously, I could thank a lot of people. One person in particular that I do want to call out is John Jones, who is going to remain our Lead Independent Director. And the combination of John and Les Brun before him were incredible mentors to me, incredibly helpful in providing advice and guidance on behalf of the Board. And also, I'm proud to call them friends. And I also want to thank Gary Butler and Art Weinbach, my predecessors who gave me the opportunity to be here today and also help me a lot in terms of making me the person I am and the leader that I am today. I'm proud of a couple of things. I'll just mention a few. One of them is I'm proud of our growth. We doubled our revenues over the last 10 or 11 years. And today, as you know, we reached an important milestone of 1 million clients. So I appreciate -- I wish I could say that it was anything other than a coincidence. But however it happened. It's a great thing to have happened here on my last earnings call. We made it through a lot of challenges, economic. We went through, what I would call financial repression in terms of interest rates, which fortunately now we have a little bit of the opposite situation, which we'll talk about today. So there's many QEs. I think there were three QEs over my tenure. And then the final straw that almost broke the camel\u2019s back was interest rates. Even on the 10-year going, I think it was like under 0.5% in the pandemic, which was really kind of incredible to see happen. We also made it through a pandemic that hopefully only happens every 100 years, and we had some dissident shareholders that also had some opinions about how to run ADP that we had to deal with. I'm also proud of our associates. I'm proud they've always said about their commitment to our clients and to ADP. There's something that my predecessors and the culture have around our client centricity, which is really remarkable, and our associates always step up to the plate and deliver in a business that, again, we don't get a lot of credit, and I know that we're not quite up there in terms of the list of first responders and people who save lives. But we do keep the economy going, and we do, I think, make sure that commerce worldwide operates smoothly. So our associates are the ones who get that done, and I'm proud of them. The person I'm most proud of is Maria. She's now been tested. She's prepared. She's been through a very thoughtful and long succession process, and she's going to be the -- what is only the seventh CEO of ADP. And I know that she's the right person starting from the ground up. I wish I could have said that because that's what makes this special, this place special. We love to bring in talent from the outside but we have some incredible people that grow up and know this place, understand this place and know how to make it continue to hum the way it's been humming for more than 70 years. Most importantly, she not only knows our industry, but she knows our clients' needs deeply and takes great interest in that. And that is going to serve us well, as well as for growth orientation, which I think is going to be very important for ADP's future. Last thing I'll say is that I recently told our team at a senior meeting that I tried -- I strive to be what I learned about many, many years ago, something called a servant leader. And I tried to be that way to my team and to my organization here at ADP. But I want all of you to know that I tried to be that also to all of you and to our shareholders, as much as I tried to be that way for our clients and our associates. It's been truly an honor of a lifetime to serve ADP\u2019s CEO. And we are kind of a company that likes to fly under the radar. We kind of like it that way. So I know that nobody is going to write any books about us or they may not be even writing articles about us today, but this is one of the most successful commercial enterprises in history. All I have to do is go back and look at the track record. Most people don't do that. They don't go back and look at the 10-year to 20-year and, in our case, the 50 year. The company went public in 1961. I encourage you to look at our history, our results and our TSR and compare it to some of the greatest investors and investments of all time. And I think you'll see that ADP ranks right up at the top. Anybody who knows me knows how much I love sports and how -- what a sports -- I am. So I was trying to think of an analogy. And I feel like not only did I join the championship team, but I won the Super Bowl being here at ADP. It's really been an incredible ride. But right now, it's time to pass the torch. It's always great to have change, especially in a company like ADP because I know you can rely on our consistent, predictable results, but we also have to continue to grow for decades to come. And the only way to do that is to bring in fresh thinking and to have change. And that's exactly what we're doing with Maria. So before I talk about the quarter and the results, I'm going to turn it over to Maria and let her say a few things.\nMaria Black: Thank you, Carlos. You mentioned servant leadership, and I have to say that you are truly the embodiment of servant leadership. You have always kept our North Star true, which is putting our clients and our associates first. And I know I speak on behalf of all of our stakeholders, our associates, our shareholders, the communities we serve and the 1 million clients now we have the honor of serving and thanking you for everything that you've done over the decade that you served as our CEO. So my sincere thank you to you, Carlos.  I'm truly humbled and grateful for this opportunity and certainly for the confidence, Carlos that you've given me and that the Board has given me and entrusted me with this role. I am genuinely thrilled to lead ADP. You mentioned it, and it's true. I did start from the ground up. I started with this company 26 years ago, selling ADP's products and offering store-to-door. This ability to really see our clients from the front line has given me a vision and a true understanding of the client centricity that you mentioned that we embody as a company. And since selling 26 years ago door to door, I've served in roles all across ADP in sales and service, implementation, operations, including our PEO and SBS. I'm really, really proud of the role that we play in our clients' lives and how they trust us to really help them succeed in their HCM journey. For the last 73 years, we've had an amazing legacy and a culture. And that culture is really anchored in innovation and it's anchored in developing and providing technology and solutions that help address our clients' needs but also help address the needs of their workers. And I'm incredibly proud to be a part of that journey as we continue the modernization that we've been undergoing over the last few years. Of course, as you mentioned, none of this is possible without the 60,000 dedicated associates that we have that are at the center of absolutely everything that we deliver. I am committed to continuing to empower their great talent, which time and time again has reshaped the HCM industry through a relentless focus on again, solving our clients' needs and predicting their future needs. I'm also grounded by our history and our own beginning as a small business out of Paterson, New Jersey, founded by Henry Taub, a man who simply wanted to help local businesses. Then and now, I know and I feel deeply that this core value continues to define us as a company. So with that, thank you again, Carlos, and thank you to the Board. And now I will thank you in advance to all of our stakeholders in your confidence as we continue to build on ADP's incredibly strong results-oriented foundation. We continue to drive product innovation, leading technology. And more than anything, we continue deliver the consistent value creation that we're known for as the leader in the HCM industry.  So with that, I think it's appropriate to turn it over to the results this quarter.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Thanks, Maria. Speaking of consistent value creation, let me start talking a little bit about the results here so we can get to the questions. We got off to a really strong start in fiscal 2023, with strong results that reflected the momentum we've been building for several quarters now. In Q1, we delivered 10% revenue growth, 11% on an organic constant currency basis, and this was driven by strength in a number of our businesses. And on top of that, we delivered 30 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion as our revenue outperformance helped us overcome elevated expense grow over from last year's first quarter as well as continued investments in the business, which we anticipated and communicated to you last quarter.  We delivered 13% adjusted EPS growth in the quarter, and we remain well positioned as we move ahead for the rest of the year. I'll cover a few highlights for the quarter before I turn it back over to Maria. Our new business bookings, we showed continued momentum through Q1 with demand strongest in our downmarket offering like RUN and our retirement services businesses, and we also continue to see strong traction in our PEO solution. At the same time, bookings growth in our international business started a bit softer than we had hoped. We're continuing to watch the demand environment in international markets as clients and prospects there are dealing with a number of uncertainties, as you know. We are keeping an eye on the macroeconomic environment as well, but overall demand remains strong, and our pipeline looks solid. We'll share further updates on what we're seeing with bookings as we progress through the year. Our ES retention was very strong with a new overall Q1 record level led by great performance in our mid-market. We accomplished this year-over-year improvement despite further normalization in small business out of business rates in the quarter. We assume we will continue to experience normalization in out-of-business rates towards prepandemic levels as the year progresses, and we are clearly very pleased with the Q1 results and -- that were better than expected. Our pays to control metric was 6% for the quarter, in line with our expectations as strong hiring that our clients have conducted these past few quarters has carried through to strong pays per control growth this quarter. We continue to expect deceleration in pays per control growth later this year, and we've seen sequential employment growth begin to slow both in the National Employment Report and in public data. But that said, job postings and other leading indicators within our client base suggest that, at the very least in the short term, demand for labor will remain solid. And moving on to our PEO. We saw a modest deceleration in average worksite employee growth in the average worksite employee growth rate, which was anticipated, but the 12% growth was slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter, and we're very pleased with that growth. Demand for both our PEO and our ES HRO offerings remains high as the value proposition for a fully outsourced model continues to resonate in the market. And in fact, our HRO businesses combine now to serve over 3 million worksite employees out of the 40 million total workers paid by ADP. Q1 not only provided a strong start to fiscal 2023 but also represented a major milestone in our company's history. As we -- as I mentioned earlier, we crossed the 1 million client mark during the quarter. What an incredible accomplishment. We accomplished this by driving improvement and growth on a consistent basis through decades of different employment cycles, business environments and technology shifts. It's a proud moment that was made possible only because of our relentless focus on meeting the needs of our clients, as Maria mentioned, both by delivering exceptional service and providing leading HCM technology. underpinning all of this is the dedication of our associates who ultimately make ADP a company it is today. As we look ahead, we recognize the need to remain agile in this unique and dynamic economic environment. And it is certainly our hope that inflation normalizes soon without significant harm to the global economy. But if macroeconomic conditions instead prove more challenging than we'd all like, we believe our stable business model should allow us to maintain our focus on innovation and our steady approach to investment, positioning us to continue driving long-term sustainable growth for many years to come. And it's for that reason that while I am incredibly excited to have reached 1 million clients, I'm even more excited about the opportunities ahead for ADP.  And I'll now turn it over to our new CEO, Maria.\nMaria Black: Thank you, Carlos. As I mentioned earlier, I am also proud of the collective efforts of our associates who made this achievement possible. One of the beauties of having 1 million clients and directly serving 3 million worksite employees in our HRO businesses is that we have unparalleled insight into the needs of the HR department, and we are putting that insight to work. I'm proud to share that, in September, we won the top HR product at annual HR Tech Conference for the eighth year in a row, this time for a new offering we're calling Intelligent Self-Service. HR departments today devote a significant amount of time to addressing questions from their workers to help better manage this volume of worker and practitioner interaction. Intelligent Self-Service uses predictive analytics to help proactively address common issues before workers need to contact or HR leaders. Not only does this solution ultimately improve the experience for the worker, but it further enables the practitioner to focus on more strategic items, which is a key objective for our clients. There are a few different components to Intelligent Self-Service. The first is something we're calling action cards, which you can think of as proactive nudges in the ADP mobile app that appear in the flow of work so that workers are alerted and encouraged to act when there's something they need to address such as a missed time punch or time card approval. Another component of the offering is our virtual assistant chatbot, which was previously available to our clients' HR practitioners but is now, for the first time, being expanded to workers as well in order to address their requests or questions. And the third piece is case management, which helps with more complex problems that require HR systems. This feature presents a streamlined way to create, manage and track workers' interactions with our HR experts and quickly get to the right experts based on the workers made. Intelligent Self-Service is designed to create a better HR experience and reduce work, and we believe we are designing a solution that can reduce our clients' case volume by 30% or more, which, of course, would be an incredibly value-add win for everyone. We have already rolled out some of these components and are in pilot for others, but the feedback so far has been very positive. I also want to give a quick Q1 update on our new user experience. As a reminder, our new user experience represents a significant enhancement we've been making to our scaled strategic platforms using new design principles to make them even more intuitive and more personal so our users can easily leverage our solutions to the fullest. Last year, we moved clients on RUN, iHCM and Next Gen HCM as well as the ADP Mobile app over to the new user experience. And later in the year, we also moved 20,000 Workforce Now clients to the new UX. Enhancing Workforce Now is especially important given how integral the platform is to so many of our businesses, and I'm pleased to now share we've taken that 20,000 clients last year to over 80,000 through the end of Q1 with essentially all of Workforce Now clients on this new enhanced experience. Among other user experience initiatives, we relaunched the ADP RUN mobile app with our new UX with managers and HR practitioners of small businesses running payroll and HR while on the go. This app is a powerful tool for them, and the relaunch has been a resounding success. You can see the app and the reviews for yourself, but it's doing phenomenally well with 4.9 stars on several thousand reviews representing meaningful improvement from the experience it is replacing. These are exactly the types of outcomes we had hoped to achieve with this user experience work, and we are very excited about continuing to roll out to more solutions within our key platforms. From our voice of employee offering, we mentioned last quarter to our new Intelligent Self-Service capability to our UX deployment into our ongoing Next Gen rollout, our product teams are busy and our clients are excited about the continued innovation at ADP and our overall modernization journey. We look forward to continuing to develop ways to provide more value to our clients and prospects in this dynamic HCM and economic environment and to ultimately deliver on our bookings growth goals for this year and beyond.  And with that, over to Don.\nDon McGuire: Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter represented a strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth on a reported basis and 11% growth on an organic constant currency basis. Our EBIT margin was up 30 basis points, coming in above our expectations as strong overall revenue growth and growing clients fund interest revenue contribution as well as favorable workers' compensation reserve adjustments in our PEO overcame inflation-related cost pressures and higher-than-typical year-over-year headcount growth. Our robust revenue and margin performance combined to drive 13% adjusted EPS growth for the quarter supported by our ongoing return of cash to our investors via share repurchases. In our Employer Services segment, increased 9% on a reported and 11% on an organic constant currency basis. Key drivers to this growth were strong bookings and retention performance we delivered in recent quarters as well as solid contributions from price and pays per control. And of course, client funds interest, which mostly benefits the ES segment, grew nicely in Q1 with 39% growth driven by a healthy 9% balance growth and 40 basis point improvement in average yield. Partially offsetting that was FX, which was a slightly bigger headwind than we had anticipated. Our ES margin increase of 50 basis points was higher than planned primarily as a result of that strong revenue growth. For our PEO, revenue in the quarter grew 13%. Average worksite employees increased 12% on a year-over-year basis to $704,000 as bookings and same-store pays both continue to perform well, though the same-store pays contributed less than it did in recent quarters as we expected. PEO margin increased 80 basis points in the quarter due primarily to revenue growth and favorable workers' compensation reserve adjustments. Let me now turn to our updated outlook for fiscal '23. I think, overall, you'll find a very steady outlook compared to our prior guidance with upside due in part to higher interest rates.  Beginning with the ES segment revenues, we now expect growth of 7% to 8% and driven by the following key assumptions. First, we continue to expect ES new business bookings to grow between 6% and 9%. And as Carlos covered, we see a stable overall demand environment at this time, but it's still early in the year. And with a wide range of outcomes and we will continue to watch for impact from a potentially slowing global economy as we progress from here. For ES retention, we were happy to deliver another strong quarter, but we believe it's prudent to anticipate further normalization of small business out of business rates as we move through fiscal '23. As such, at this time, we're leaving our outlook unchanged at down 25 basis points to 50 basis points. Meanwhile, we will look to maintain our strong retention levels in our other business units. For pays per control, we had healthy 6% growth in Q1, in line with expectations, and we continue to anticipate a return to a more typical 2% to 3% growth rate for the full year as employment growth moderates. As we discussed last quarter, our pays per control growth outlook assumes a deceleration in growth in Q2 and very little growth in the second half of fiscal '23. This could, of course, prove to be either too conservative or bullish depending on how macroeconomic factors develop, but it still feels like a reasonable assumption to make at this point. Last quarter, we spoke a bit about price, and there is no change to our expectation for price to contribute about 100 basis points to 150 basis points to our ES revenue growth in fiscal '23. Our clients understand these price increases and recognize that they reflect our own cost pressures. And for client funds interest revenue, we now expect higher average rates compared to our prior outlook. Our client funds short portfolio will continue to benefit as the Federal funds rate increases over the balance of the fiscal year, and our new investments in our client extended and loan portfolios are now expected to yield about 4.3%. Between those two drivers, we now expect the average yield on our client funds portfolio to be 2.4% in fiscal '23, which is about 20 basis points higher than our prior outlook. We continue to expect our client funds balances to grow 4% to 6%. And putting those together, we now expect our client funds interest revenue to increase to a range of $790 million to $810 million in fiscal '23, up $70 million from our prior outlook. Partially offsetting this revenue upside is higher short-term borrowing costs associated with our client funds extended strategy. With higher expected commercial paper and reverse repo rates over the rest of the year, we now expect the net impact from our client fund's extended strategy to be $720 million to $740 million in fiscal '23, up $45 million from our prior outlook. One last factor to consider is our ES -- in our ES revenue outlook is FX headwind, which has unfortunately become a more meaningful drag over the last three months. We're now factoring in an FX headwind closer to 2% for fiscal '23 ES revenue, up slightly from our prior assumption. For ES margin, we now expect an increase of 200 basis points to 225 basis points, up 25 basis points from our prior outlook. We continue to expect our margins to benefit from our strong revenue growth outlook, including growth in client funds interest revenue, and we're pleased to be able to increase our outlook accordingly. Moving on to the PEO segment, where we're making very few changes. We continue to expect PEO revenue and PEO revenue excluding zero margin pass-throughs to grow 10% to 12%. The primary driver for our PEO growth is our outlook for average worksite employee growth of 8% to 10%. We now expect PEO margin to be flat to up 25 basis points in fiscal '23, narrowing our prior range higher due in part to the strong Q1 margin performance. Adding it all up, we now expect consolidated revenue growth of 8% to 9% in fiscal '23 and adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 125 basis points to 150 basis points. We still expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '23 to be about 23%, and we now expect adjusted EPS growth of 15% to 17% supported by our steady share repurchases.  And now I'll turn it back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Pete Christiansen with Citi.\nPeter Christiansen : First, congrats to Maria. Looking forward to seeing your touch on strategic vision here and certainly to Carlos for such a successful tenure as CEO, particularly through some volatile events in the last couple of years, for sure. I just had a question as it relates to bookings trends certainly see that the outlook is held steady. And I know that we're kind of early in the selling season. But if there's any -- just wondering if you could put any color on any differentiating trends you're seeing at this point of the year, maybe perhaps versus the last year or two, maybe attach rates or on ancillary modules or even going to more outsourced models, seeing any changes in behavior there? And then as it relates to the pricing discussion that we just had, do you feel like you have any more room? It seems like your clients are responding well and things look good. But do you still -- do you think that there's potential upside to the pricing strategy? Sorry.\nMaria Black : Thank you, Pete, and thank you for the well wishes. I certainly appreciate them. And as you mentioned, look forward to connecting with many of you around strategic vision going forward. With respect to bookings and really thinking through year-on-year changes in behavior, I'll comment on that, and then I'll turn it over to Don that can talk about whether or not we have more room on price. . But again, just to kind of confirm the overall outlook at 6% to 9%, we do feel confident in this outlook. When I think about how we planned for the year, and we were generally pleased with the results that we saw in the first quarter, in fact, they were actually technically a record from a year-on-year perspective. But the thing that makes us not necessarily call that out in that way and really speaking to the continued momentum, to your question, it's really about in the context of the records that we've had, in the past few quarters, it's really been broad-based across every bit of the portfolio. And as you heard in the prepared remarks this morning, we had significant strength in our downmarket offerings. Really pleased to see that across our RUN portfolio, the small business segment inclusive of our insurance offerings, retirement offerings. We also continue to have significant strength in our HRO offerings, inclusive of the PEO. So in terms of changing behavior, I see that as constant behavior as it relates to -- those are businesses that have had continued strength over several quarters and the value proposition, both downmarket and certainly into the HRO space has been good. I think the area, again, that we called out a little bit that we're keeping an eye on is really our international business. Now the good news with our international business is that it's a small contributor to our overall bookings. But when we look at what really happened with the international space, specifically for this quarter, we don't still actually see a macro impact. We see more of an impact of the strength that we had coming into or coming off of a record Q4. And so when you think about our upmarket business, specifically our international business, there are times that it's a bit lumpy as we pull deals forward to accelerate through the fourth quarter. And candidly, who wouldn't want to have an incredible finish and an incredible quarter? But as it has for several decades, I would say that does sometimes lend itself to some of those businesses needing -- continue to rebuild the pipeline. So that's really what we think is happening. But at the same time, we're very -- we're keeping an eye on specifically in Europe, what's happening in the Ukraine, what's happening with the energy crisis. Those are watch items for us. But just kind of reiterate, we don't see any macro overall trends. We don't see changes in behavior. We see the strength continuing in the downmarket and into our HRO and PEO offerings, and we were very, very pleased with the results this quarter, and they are record results in that respect.\nDon McGuire : Yes. And with respect to the pricing, we've been very happy with our ability to execute the price increase in the way we did. And as we've said on prior calls, we're mindful of the fact that these are incremental costs for our clients as well, and we need to be competitive. So we made sure that we've price increased and passed on the costs we have in a way that keeps our customers with us for a very, very long time. Having said that, we said 100 basis points to 150 basis points. And I would tell you that, currently, we're pushing towards the upper end of that range in the price increase. So we've done very well against expectations and executed, as I said, well across the business. Of course, is there more available? Good question. If we look at our client base, particularly with the large clients, we do have contractual obligations that come due from time to time. And a number of those are tied to various price indices, et cetera. So that limits the ability to do anything beyond some of the pricing indices that drive or undermine or underlay, if you will, the price that we have. But I guess I would say we've been very happy with where we are now, and we'll always look to see if there's an opportunity. But I think that we want to make sure -- we will continue to make sure that we do what's best for ADP in the long term as opposed to being too overzealous, if you will, with short-term price increases.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang : Great. Carlos, I want to say, again, again, grateful to have worked with you and share the time and learn from you from, I guess, over 40 earnings calls and meetings and stuff. So I appreciate that. And of course, congrats to Maria. I want to just ask, if you don't mind, 100% agree from the release, Carlos led the transition from payroll to HCM. So I know you can't tell us everything in terms of what's next here, but is it fair to think the focus might be more so on the employee now in addition to the employer, in addition to modernization, maybe data? Just maybe some thoughts there would be great. Love to hear it.\nCarlos Rodriguez : I think that was for you, Maria, given that I'll be sitting on the beach.\nMaria Black : Fair enough. Thank you for the chance to comment a little bit. Obviously, early days as it relates to -- I mean essentially starting as early days as it relates to having conversations around long-term strategy. I think the first thing I'd like to reiterate, I know I talked about my 26 years here. I have spent eight of those as part of the incredible management team that Carlos alluded to earlier, and that's been a part of the journey that we've been on as it relates to the overall modernization journey. So I think you mentioned the transition from payroll to HCM. That is a piece of that modernization. But in my mind, it's more broad-based than that. It's really been about the decisions we've made, everything from our strategic locations to early days of platform migrations to configuring our organization to really create a technology organization. We've been actively modernizing our service organization. You hear me speak about that all the time in terms of continuing the modernization of tools but also making sure that we're taking the work out for our clients. We've been making a transition to the public cloud. And then one of my favorite topics is the modern selling approach that we've been embarking upon that really, as we go on for many years as we found it inside sales, if you will, 20 years ago to the most recent during the pandemic, really focused on digital selling and meeting the buyers in a different way. So I think all of that is really about our modernization journey. And I think as I look forward into the next decade, if you will, in the next chapter, it is really about continuing the great work and the foundation that you mentioned that Carlos laid. I have a lot of passion around our clients. I have a lot of passion around the 40 million workers that they pay and how we can create value for each one of those stakeholders, both the workers as you mentioned, the clients' employees as well as our clients. And my ultimate goal, Carlos touched on it, I think I mentioned it as well upfront, when I think about client centricity and really solving meaningful things for our clients, I think the last decade in this modernization journey has really been about setting us up to be able to deliver value in a very different way for our clients. My goal would be to continue that journey and, in the end, make sure that our clients are in love with our products and in love with the experience that they have with ADP and the true evangelists of what it is that we bring. And I feel confident in how we've been set up to embark on that journey, and I look forward to sharing more with you on it as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh : Great. And my congratulations all around as well. Carlos, I guess, why is now the right time? I mean you've done an amazing job, you're still incredibly young. Just any thoughts as to why transition now?\nCarlos Rodriguez : Actually, it's a good question because, honestly, it's something that we started -- we were joking about it yesterday, that I started talking about this about 12 months after I became CEO. Not that I was trying to leave 12 months after I became CEO. But in case people haven't noticed, I'm like a business junky, right? So I just love business. I also love kind of the whole idea of like a successful commercial enterprise, and you have this kind of tension in this area of succession where the longer you are around, the more you know. There's some studies out there that show that beyond a certain amount of time is really when CEOs hit their stride. But then there's an equal amount of research that shows you move beyond a certain time, you become stale. You don't have any new ideas. You become enamored with your own ideas and thoughts. And so I have not written the book on this, but I read a lot of books on this. And my sense was that kind of beyond seven years was -- there was diminishing returns based on my \"research.\" And you can see that I made it past that. And some of that was -- circumstances, I think, made it such because I didn't have any specific goal. Like I'm not trying to run out the door. My -- the only thing I want to do is the best thing for ADP, and the best thing in this case now for Maria and for our Board. And so this is a collective decision over -- I know it's hard to believe but really over a decade as to what the right timing was, who the right person was and how to position them for success and how to position the company for success. By the way, that also involves -- we had a very meaningful refreshment of our Board that, I think, is something that has to be taken into context because it's all a package, right? It's the right CEO, the right Board, the right Board leadership. And so I think that bringing the Board along, I think, required a little bit more time than I had expected. So that's a long way of saying I don't have any magic answers to what the right time is. What I know for sure is not the right way to do it. There's nothing to do with my age and whether I'm young or I'm old or whatnot. It has to be done when it's the right time and it's the best thing for ADP, and I think that's what we just did.\nKevin McVeigh : That makes a lot of sense. The numbers speak for themselves. So I'll leave it there. Congrats again. \nCarlos Rodriguez : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. \nKartik Mehta : Carlos, just -- or Maria, just your thoughts on the economy. Obviously, I look at your results and things look good. I know you said maybe the second half, you're just being a little bit more cautious. But as you look at kind of the numbers now and you talk to your customers, just your thoughts on how the economy looks now and just kind of the outlook over the next six to nine months?\nCarlos Rodriguez: So we obviously don't have the market cornered on economic forecast. We do have a reasonable amount of data, particularly on what I would call the near-term next few quarters, I would say. But when you look at the last two, three, five years, 10 years, really, as long as I've been doing this, you have to be really careful about taking economic forecasts at face value. So you have to be careful. You have to be prepared for all eventualities. And that's why we like to call ourselves an all-weather business model because I think we actually perform, I think, through a variety -- obviously, better in some than others. But I guess that's the way of saying we're not obsessed with economic forecast because if I had taken economic forecast at face value over the last three or four years, we would have made numerous mistakes. And I think all I have to do is go back. I know nobody does this because otherwise there wouldn't be -- economists wouldn't exist. But if you look at what economists forecast 12 months prior and then what actually happened or 20 months prior to what actually happened, that's not really the right way to run a business. But it doesn't inform our decisions right, and our planning.  And as you mentioned, what happened this year in terms of our fiscal year planning is we thought -- kind of common sense told us that some of these things were going to happen like normalization of downmarket retention, right, towards hopefully still above pre-pandemic levels but not at the kind of levels they were when the government was providing so much support for small businesses that you could just see it in the data in terms of the drop in bankruptcies and out of business and so forth. So we expected some normalization there. Likewise, pays per control, it's not -- you just don't make numbers up. Like we -- if you assume that you reach kind of \"full employment\", and that the population and employment [Audio Gap] employable people is growing at a certain rate, you can kind of back into kind of a normalized pays per control rate, and then you sprinkle in a little bit -- maybe there's going to be some economic weakness in the back half. And I think what we signaled and what we have in our plan is, I think, kind of flattish pays per control growth, which to me personally is feeling conservative right now based on the -- we feel like we have this kind of continued strength into this quarter, and that typically doesn't fall off the cliff right away. But maybe that happens in the first quarter of '24 that it becomes flattish. I don't know. But I know that right now, there are definitely still -- we got back to what employment was pre pandemic, but the population also grew and the employable number of people grew. So labor force participation is still below where it was before. So there is definitely still room for some employment growth there. So this could be a very strange slowdown, right, or if you want to call it a recession, where it's, I think Danny calls it a labor full recession where it doesn't feel like employment, at least the stuff that we look at background checks, job postings, et cetera. I mean if you look at the jokes, you look at everything, there's still a lot of -- we had 260,000 jobs created -- and that wasn't 500,000, it wasn't 1 million, but in any other environment, that would be like an incredibly strong number, but it's clearly is clearly slowing, but everything we see is that the labor markets remain, again, in the time horizon that we have visibility to pretty strong or certainly not as strong as a year ago or when we were in the middle of the recovery from the pandemic, but that's really more of the comparisons than kind of anything underlying.  So I think we're just heading back to kind of more normal rates, but in an unusual way where the labor market doesn't appear to be the leading the leader in the slowdown. It appears to be people spending less on stuff that they spent a lot of during the pandemic, if I can be bold. That might be like exercise bicycles. It might be things like grills, like -- and maybe even, unfortunately, for a company that's close to my heart, software, right, and some things that are -- that you have these kind of, unfortunately, fluctuations of demand that we've never seen before. And so the now how do you predict and forecast how that all kind of lands in the medium to longer term. It's very, very hard for any company to do. But specifically for us, labor is still strong. As long as labor is strong, our clients are still looking for tools to employ, to hire and to manage that labor. And we have this other little weird thing happening to us, which is really fantastic, which is interest rates are rising. And they\u2019re rising in the face -- I mean, typically, when interest rates are rising, the economy is slowing, and that's exactly obviously what the intent of the Fed is. But right now, you're kind of at this point where we're getting this big tailwind from interest rates, and it doesn't feel like that's going to change again in the near term. It doesn't mean that rates won't stop increasing, but if rates stop increasing, like, for example, like in the spring of '23, and they stay there, home run for ADP. All of you and everybody internally here at ADP make fun of me when I used to talk about how our balances in 2008 were like $15 billion and they had grown to $30 billion, but our client funds interest had been cut almost by 2/3 because of interest rates. And I used to say, \"Can you imagine if interest rates go back to where they -- near back to where they were back then, but our balance is now are $33 million and growing, I think it was 9.5% this quarter, wouldn't that be amazing?\" And that's exactly what's happening. So I'm leaving a little bit of gas in the tank for Maria. Well, actually, I can't take credit for that. I appreciate Chairman Powell helped with that. But we -- I think we have some gas in the tank here with interest rates as well, which again, is a little unusual, but I don't know if you want to call it a hedge to our business model, but -- it's definitely welcome because we are -- as you know, we always carefully watch our expenses and everything in ADP, but it's a much better place to be from an ability to invest and an ability to weather when you have this significant tailwind, which is not a secret. I mean I think Don laid out the numbers, and you can do the math. It's a pretty big tailwind.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Congrats Maria. Congrats to Carlos as well. I had two questions. The first one, just, Maria, picking up on your comments around some of the Intelligent Self-Service offerings. I think you made mention of the potential for customer service cases to be cut by 30%. I was just curious to get a little more color around that, what might be the time line for achieving that goal. And is that any kind of rough proxy for how much your customer service costs could be reduced over time if this is successful?\nMaria Black : Thank you, Jason, for the well wishes. And I'm actually -- I'm glad you asked this question because I wanted to make sure there's clarity around that 30%. And that 30%, just so we're all on the same page, it's really about our clients being able to save that time. So this is really about serving up, leveraging intelligence, artificial intelligence, machine learning. It's really serving us the most frequent interactions that can be either performed in a self-service capacity or really performed again through this case management and really taking the work out than necessarily, call it, taking the work out of our system. It's really about giving that 30% to our clients.  In fairness, it is early days as we measure this. And when I say that, I'd say that lightly in that we did study this across our 3 million HR worksite employees, if I may call them that, that in terms of the most frequent cases that get served up and what that would yield in terms of a return to our clients. And that's where that 30% comes from. But as we launch this product and more and more adoption happens, we will be keeping a keen eye on that outcome to ensure that, that number remains true, and our hope is to continue to make progress and take more work out of our -- out of the system for our clients as they navigate the relationship between them and the practitioners and the workers.\nJason Kupferberg : Just one quick follow-up. Just if nothing had changed in the rate environment since the time of the last earnings call, would you guys have raised revenue or margin guidance for fiscal '23?\nDon McGuire : I think it's -- certainly, the rates helped us. But just a couple of things to comment on. Certainly, we still we're performing well against our internal expectations on margin improvement. So we're still very focused on spend and efficiency of spend, et cetera. But I don't think that we would have been as -- we wouldn't have been as eager to raise expectations in the absence of interest rates, especially given it's still Q1, and we need a little bit of time to see how things progress over the next couple of quarters.\nCarlos Rodriguez : Well, that's fair. But I'm pretty happy with the results because we -- Don, this is just the way our culture is. So everybody is talking about all the positives that we have, like interest income and so forth. But we had some headwinds as well. Like our T&E is up significantly. Remember, last -- it's hard to remember that last year, this quarter, I think we were still in the whole Omicron thing. It was just starting and we really hadn't opened up most of our buildings. I think our salespeople were for sure in the field but not traveling and spending the way they are now. By the way, we were very grateful that we have them back in the field. . So like there are a couple of things like T&E is the smallest of them. The biggest one is when you look at our headcount numbers, it hasn't come up yet, but our sales force is I think, more than fully staffed. And as you probably heard from our comments six to nine months ago, it was difficult to get there back then. Now not only are we fully staffed but our turnover is coming down across the board not just in sales but also across the rest of the organization. So all of a sudden, if you look at our headcount growth for this quarter, it is what I would call a peak and the highest I have ever seen since I've been here at ADP. That was necessary because there was some catch-up, which is why we -- I called it a grow-over issue from last year's first quarter, where we were definitely understaffed, didn't have enough people. And then all of a sudden, our revenues actually were outperforming. The number of clients is outperforming, and you know how important retention is to us. So we set to basically stop up across the Board implementation, service and sales. And that's when you had that whole great resignation thing happening at the same time. And it was -- I mean, again, I don't think most companies go around talking about this, but we were trying to hire as fast and as many people as we could at that point. The good news is we were successful. I think the better news is that puts us in, I think, in a good position in terms of staffing and sales, but also in terms of our service and implementation organizations. And now with declining turnover again, from a plan standpoint, besides planning for patient for control to be \"flattish\" in the second half, our headcount growth declines -- the growth of headcount declines every quarter for the next 4 quarters. And I think that, I think, should help us feel good about this quarter and also about the fiscal year. So I think technically, Don is correct. By the way, if you go back to ADP's 10-year history, this has been a weird two or three years like us not raising as we hadn't raised in the quarter, again, I don't know what you would have thought of that or what it would have meant, but I think that's pretty -- any maybe can confirm or tell me I'm wrong, but like we weren't in the habit of changing a lot in the first quarter because this is -- how can we say this is a predictable, stable business that we know what we're doing and then changing set every quarter. It doesn't make sense. Now we have a pandemic, that's a different story. Like we struggled like everyone else to kind of keep a handle on what things were happening -- how things were happening on the way down and also on the way back up. But this is going to be a much more stable environment. I would hope some of you would welcome that. But with 10%, 11% growth organic and our headwinds from expenses abating here a little bit, I think we're in a pretty good position.\nDanyal Hussain : Jason, the only other thing I would point out is that in addition to interest becoming more favorable and contributing to most of the raise as you can calculate on your own, FX obviously also got worse. So in this parallel universe without a higher interest rate, we would perhaps be absorbing that higher FX and not changing the outlook.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen. \nBryan Bergin : First congrats, Carlos, on your success; and Maria, on the promotion. I wanted to just start with a more specific follow-up on the bookings trends in the pipeline. Can you just give more color on what you're seeing in those forward sales indicators, lead volumes, sales cycles in recent weeks? And really just any discernible changes you've noticed there?\nCarlos Rodriguez : Yes. I think Maria can talk about -- I think she's actually been looking into a lot of the details around pipeline disorder. The only thing that I would add is color commentary. I was trying to defer to Maria on kind of the big picture in terms of bookings. But since I've been doing this for a long time, 44 quarters and then many years kind of watching from, I guess, a year before that as not quite a year, but as President, and before that, I really paid close attention to all this stuff. And Maria mentioned it, but the problem with the crystal ball right now is that when we have the kind of finish we had, you saw how enthusiastic we were and how bullish we were in terms of our finish and whatnot. And almost predictably, when we have that kind of finish, about half of our business, we count the bookings when we sign a contract. And the other half, we only count the bookings once the client starts. And that portion of the business that -- like, by the way, that's the way most companies that sell to larger clients book their bookings, which is when you sign a contract. That's why it's called bookings. That has always been an issue when we have this very strong quarter and very strong finish, the pull-forward stuff has been driving me crazy forever because we have very strong incentives and what we call accelerators in terms of commissions and so forth that drive, and we want that because we want to get the revenue as quickly as possible, but that sometimes leads to kind of a weaker start. The problem here is that on top of that, now you have a macroeconomic challenge potentially, we definitely have a macroeconomic challenge in Europe. Luckily, it's not a huge part our bookings. So it's hard to differentiate. But what I would tell you, again, back to color, the businesses that we count the bookings when they start are mostly the downmarket businesses. So that would be SBS, PEO, et cetera. We had double-digit bookings growth in those businesses. That makes me think that it's unlikely that, all of a sudden, we have an economic whatever challenge or disaster because why would those businesses still be performing the way they are. But I would just -- a forward-looking statement, I would say I don't know for sure that that there isn't a problem in terms of demand or the economy or whatnot, but it doesn't feel from the first quarter like we could put our finger on something that says, holy cow, we have to put the kind of the red flag or the yellow warning flag up just yet. And I don't know, Maria, if you have comments in terms of a little bit more tangible\u2026\nMaria Black : Yes. Thank you, Carlos. He's right. Carlos is right. I've been studying deeply the pipeline specifically of these businesses that recognize bookings potentially have some of the pull forward into the fourth quarter. And that's primarily in the larger size type of organizations. And so in studying the pipeline kind of segment by segment, country by country, if you will, and deeply, it does appear that the pipelines are there, the pipelines are continuing to build when I think about deal cycle time, right? So you think about all the data points we are analyzing on a daily basis to really understand the question you're asking, Bryan, which is, is this an economic and macro, is this -- what is this. And the answer is, from a pipeline perspective, the pipelines are healthy. From a deal cycle time, let's go back to Carlos' commentary. It does appear that we did have a lot of pull forward, and there were potentially not enough days to pull things into the first quarter. And we have -- again, what does that really mean in the macro? It's really returning to more pre-pandemic levels. So these are not concerning deal cycle times. These are actually more normal deal cycle times, the ones that we saw pre-pandemic. What I'm referring to there is really there used to be a time that it did take a lot of time to move larger deals through the system because so many individuals are involved, whether that's on the contracting side, the legal side. During the pandemic, there was a deal acceleration that happened, and a lot of that has to do with us being stationary. That's no longer the case. We see that every day in terms of the world is back at work. And companies are reporting in the news, we are seeing incredible strength amongst our client base. We're seeing demand for HCM. There is 6% pays per control growth. So as Carlos mentioned earlier, the jobs are there. Our clients are growing. Our products and offerings fit right into that sweet spot that everybody is still trying to solve for, and our pipelines are healthy. So at this juncture, there really isn't a macro broad-based trend that we can see besides the watch areas we've called out. I think the only other comment I would make, I alluded to it earlier, and is please remember that when a quarter ago, we gave the guidance for the 6% to 9%. The way that we thought about the year, first and foremost, the first quarter is the lightest quarter for us from a pure dollar perspective. So it's the smaller contributor from a dollar perspective on the full year. The way that we planned the year, which we talked about on the 6% to 9% bookings guidance that we gave a quarter ago was really assuming some elements of a slowdown in the back half, specifically in the fourth quarter. So it's really about this quarter, i.e., the current one that we're in, which is the second quarter and the third quarter, and so in looking at where we stand today, we feel confident in the 6% to 9% in terms of how we plan for it. We didn't assume massive and severe recession, but we definitely have assumptions in there that we feel confident at this point that we can execute against.\nCarlos Rodriguez : And one of the -- if I can just add like one of the beauties of our business model is that bookings are, for sure, an incredibly important thing, especially kind of over the longer term. But I mean, I hope it's obvious that, from a revenue standpoint, again, with visibility only for the next two, three quarters, we have -- it's really about converting prior sales, which were incredibly strong in prior bookings. I mean you saw what our bookings results were for the fourth quarter and for the year. So that's the stuff that now turns into revenue in those businesses where we recognize the booking at the time we sign a contract. So that -- it's just -- I know it's obvious but just a reminder because this business doesn't -- we're not selling widgets, where if you stop selling widgets, like all of a sudden you're back to zero next quarter, like the -- I think we have a solid revenue plan that I think reflects, as Maria said, what I think was already a pretty conservative number in terms of bookings growth, particularly in the back half of the year. So we may have other issues like FX on the negative side, clients fund interest may help even more or may help less, but I don't think the bookings issue is a fiscal '23 focus item in terms of impact on revenue. \nBryan Bergin : Okay. All right. A follow-up on retention then. It seems like it's fair to say you beat your plan in 1Q. But what do you attribute that 1Q success to? Was it more a function of a slower rate of SMB out-of-business losses? Or do you think it also did better on the controllable factors as well?\nCarlos Rodriguez : It's really -- I think it's -- the controllable factors, I think, are the most satisfying part of the whole story because the story is kind of playing out a little bit the way we expected, which is small business is kind of in the process of kind of normalizing. But the really -- by the way, positive ironically in our international business, which might not be so ironic because the challenges economically, there are probably getting -- convincing people that they stay put. I don't want to say that it's not all great execution because we have a great leader in international, and we have the former great leader of international here, which is Don McGuire. So there's a lot of great things that have happened in that business that are probably powering some underlying improvement in retention. So some of it is probably inertia as a result of what's happening in the economic environment there. But the most satisfying part of the whole story here is what's happening in the mid-market, where I think some fundamental improvements that we made pre-pandemic, you remember all the pain in terms of the migrations and then the improvements in product, the UX experience improvements, all those things, it just seems like it's ratcheted up the \"potential\", the maximum potential retention, if you will, for our mid-market business, which was a record this quarter as well. Clearly, the down market -- the pace of normalization of the down market has some impact. But the big story, I think, this quarter was really the mid-market, and our international business has helped a lot on the retention side.\nDanyal Hussain : Bryan, I'll just confirm the down market didn't really contribute to the outperformance versus our expectations. So the mid-market was clearly the bigger piece.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. \nSamad Samana : I'll congrats that is given so far as well. Maybe just a question. When I think about the transitioning of the Workforce Now base to the new UX and the progress there and -- market, how should we think about maybe that were going to translate into monetary benefits? Is that more of a benefit in gross margin for a lower cost to serve or just less back-end work or higher retention, all of the above? Just help us maybe map what the kind of economic outcome is from moving over to the new UX for ADP.\nMaria Black : I have a lot of time for our new UX. I can't boast about it enough. And the majority of that reason is all of the above. We expect this to impact our clients' satisfaction, their retention, our ability to demo more, sell more. In terms of teasing out the specific results difficult, but the answer to your question is all of the above.\nSamad Samana : Got you. And then maybe one for Don, any thoughts on locking in or changing duration with rates where they are? Just as I think if I look back historically at the presentation, yields currently are higher than they've been at kind of any time for even what the long end of the portfolio looks like. Any -- any view on changing duration? I know you guys get what the mix is, but I'm curious if it were locking it in for a longer duration.\nDon McGuire : Yes, I'm going to start on this, but something tells me Carlos won't be able to resist following up on whatever I have to say here. So I guess I would say that the laddering strategy that was implemented a number of years ago has delivered great returns. And while I think everyone can see the temptation of changing the duration and trying to benefit more from short-term rates, rates will either normalize or they may even come down again at some point in the future. So this laddering strategy that's been deployed over the number of years has served us very well, and we expect it will continue to serve us well. And not to say that this question doesn't come up from time to time if we discuss it. But every time that we look at it, we -- you really either -- you're making a bet for today as opposed to for down the road. And given the positive experience we've had, it doesn't really behoove us to make any substantial changes to a policy and a program that has been doing very, very well. Carlos, I'm sure...\nCarlos Rodriguez : I have nothing to add other than -- I obviously picked the right time to retire. Very well said. And because I think that encapsulates lots of other things where we focus more on the longer-term in the medium term rather than because, again, if rates do normalize, as you said, we're going to be very grateful that we -- that our extended portfolio that we took advantage of these \"higher rates\" that will help us for two, three, in some cases, five years down the road. So it's the right -- we're not a financial services company. We're not a bank, and that's not the kind of best that we're trying to make here. This is just -- happens to be a nice little windfall as a result of a business model that we have that allows us to kind of manage float income at a very, very large scale. And anyway, well said.\nSamad Samana : I think we all appreciate the institutional continuity as the transition occurs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird.\nMark Marcon : Carlos, congratulations on a great tenure not just as CEO but everything that you did prior to that. And Maria, look forward to working with you and getting to know you even more over the coming years. I'm wondering, can you talk a little bit about how you're set up for this current fall selling season? Certainly, you've got a number of big product improvements. Which ones could we end up seeing like being incremental in terms of PEPM? And just how strong do you think the sales momentum could be? How are you thinking about your marketing efforts, particularly with all the improvements that you've got in place?\nMaria Black : Yes. Thanks, Mark. And similarly, I look forward to spending more time together, and I've appreciated the time thus far that we spent together getting to know each other. So in terms of selling season, we do feel -- I think Carlos mentioned, I think the first call-out I would make, I know you asked specifically about products and contributions PEPM, but I think it's important to go back to the discussion that Carlos had around headcount. So I've been -- I spent some of last year and last fiscal year speaking about a flattish headcount growth as it related to sales. We committed to a -- business growth heading into the quarter, and I'm pleased to report, as Carlos alluded to, that we are ahead of those plans. And so what that means is that we have more quota carriers in the system as we head into selling season, significantly more than we expected but significantly more than last selling season. And that, in and of itself, is the biggest contributor that we have to our overall results as we think about the productivity of more people in the system and, as Carlos also mentioned, with tenure of those associates picking up the increase in productivity of our sellers as they lap the 10-year band. So I think that's the biggest variable I see. We do have a lot of amazing things as it relates to products in the system. Certainly, the new user experience being broad-based across all of the products gives the sellers an extra step in their momentum as they head into the end of the year as it relates to demos due to that nature. I mentioned some of the other products such as the voice of the employee and our Intelligent Self-Service, which both serve us up through our mid-market. So that mid-market value proposition is continuing to grow. The other is the strength that we are seeing in that PEO and the HRO are comprehensive and managed services business -- businesses as it relates to customers that are continuing to face the complexity. By the way, whether they are up market, in the mid-market or even down market needing more of those tools to navigate the complexity of being an employer, and so we see tremendous strength there. And so we're making good progress on our Next Gen. Very pleased to see specifically on our Next Gen Payroll how that's resonating in the mid-market with Workforce Now. And as we continue to increase the addressable area that we are able to target with those offerings undoubtedly will yield, as you suggested, greater sales, greater PEPM as well some of these enhanced features and products that are served up through our existing platforms that I've mentioned before.\nMark Marcon : That's great. And then with regards to Next Gen Payroll, can you give us an update in terms of what percentage of the new Workforce Now clients are now getting Next Gen Payroll?\nMaria Black : Yes. So we are -- we committed to -- and I've been talking about kind of that 50% of our overall mid-market and Workforce Now clients, and we continue to make progress on that. So we're not entirely -- at the entire market that work with an outsource today. But each and every day, actually, in every release, we continue to clear the path for more and more opportunities to be able to participate in that Next Gen offering, which is truly the game changer for ADP as it relates to the innovation there. \nMark Marcon: That's terrific. And Carlos, in terms of sports analogy, maybe Don Shula might be appropriate, great track record. Congrats.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Yes, listen, I appreciate that because I joke around with people that I used to actually watch TV and sports a long time ago, but there was like about a 20-year period where I have no idea what's going on. But I do know Don Shula and I know the goose egg defense, I think they were called to say, whatever the hell they were.\nMark Marcon: It was the no-name defense.\nCarlos Rodriguez: So no-name defense. There you go there. I screwed it up. It was trying to prove that I actually knew something about sports and I blew it so. But I appreciate that. That's greatly appreciated. You're a class act yourself, Mark. Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one more question, and it comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut : Good morning, and congratulations, Carlos and Maria, Carlos, all the best for you in the next chapter. Don, a question for you on pays per control growth. 6%, clearly well above the 2% to 3% guide. But as you noted, contemplated, can you walk us through the sequencing of kind of pays per control in terms of what's embedded in the quarterly thought process as we go through FY '23?\nDon McGuire : Yes. So I think we were happy with 6% growth in the first quarter. And once again, back to Carlos' earlier comments, if you had believed all the economic forecasts, you might not have been expecting to see that stronger growth in pays per control. But we do continue to see the pays per control growth moderating down in the first half of this year. And as we shared -- as I shared in the prior -- the prepared comments, we have virtually zero pays per control growth in the back half of the year. So we do expect that we should -- given the strength of the first quarter, the first half should be a little bit better. I think we've reflected that in some of our guidance here already. And as we go through the next few months, we will be in a position to better decide whether we think we're going to be bullish or bearish on what's going to happen in the back half. And quite frankly, I think we'd all like to be very bullish about what's going to happen based on the first quarter's results, but I think if we did that, we'd kind of look a little bit foolish given all the predictions and all the storm clouds that people are talking about. So 6% first quarter slowing for the first half and then essentially very little growth if any, in the back half is what we're looking at.\nCarlos Rodriguez : Yes. And I think the simple math is, again, rather than getting into individual quarters because that talk about trying to like -- it's very hard to pin down that exact number. But I think ballpark, 6 for the first half, zero for the second half, gets you to 2 to 3 that you have for the full year. I mean that's probably the right -- obviously, the way we laid it out is slightly different than that but that's close enough, I think, for what you're trying to accomplish, I think.\nDavid Togut : Appreciate that insight. Just as a quick follow-up. Looking at Slide [Audio Gap] zero, the 25 basis point increase for the full year. Can you walk us through how big the workers' compensation reserve adjustment was in the September quarter and how you expect that to trend through the year?\nDon McGuire : Sure. I mean, I can give you the specific numbers, you'll see them later in the Q anyway. So the -- we had a $14 million positive adjustment in the first quarter, and that compares to a $10 million positive adjustment in the first quarter of last year. So not that significant, $4 million, give or take. So that's the -- those are the raw numbers. We do not expect to see as good a reserve release in this fiscal year as we saw last year. There's still several quarters to go through, and the actuarials let us know what those numbers are, but we are contemplating the same level of reserve adjustment or recovery as we did in FY '22.\nCarlos Rodriguez : The only -- the other color commentary that I would add is, I think the PEO -- again, if you look at last year, it's obviously, we've seen, as expected, some deceleration, but I would call 12% employee growth is still pretty strong. That obviously requires investment, right, in terms of service, implementation expense, et cetera. And so I would say that the PEO is one of those places where we were really adding a lot in terms of expense and resources from a place where we were not where we needed to be, call it, last year's first quarter. So that's the poster child, I think, for this kind of grow-over expense situation that we have. But the good news is, I think, is we are -- we're staffed. Again, turnover is improving across the board in terms of all parts of ADP. And I'm talking to other CEOs, I think this is happening kind of across. Things are just kind of settling down. That helps a lot because improvements in tenure help a lot in terms of productivity and just getting the work done.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I am pleased to hand the program over to Carlos Rodriguez for closing remarks.\nCarlos Rodriguez: Well, what can I say? Another disappointing quarter where no one asked about the dividend. So let me just say that if the Board -- obviously I don't want to get ahead of the Board, but if the Board approves a dividend increase in November, this will be our 48th year of increasing dividends, which I think is a pretty elite group out there. And if you look at our payout ratio and you assume the Board will want to stay in the same payout ratio, you can do the math in terms of what's going to happen with our dividend. I think people really way underestimate. I hope this doesn't become an environment where for the next 10 years people are very focused on dividends because that has its own negative implications. But if you look at over 50 years or 70 years or 100 years, dividends matter, right? And compounding growth of dividends matters a lot. If you look at ADP's return, I'm doing a little math since we went public, which is why I was bragging about this being one of the most successful commercial enterprises in history. And again, and all of you have the same HP 12C calculators, you do that math, it's a pretty important driver of overall returns. So I'm incredibly proud of that. Maria gets to be the person who will preside over the celebration, again, forward-looking statements assuming we get there, of reaching 50 years, which will make us a dividend king. And I think there's only like less than 15 companies that have accomplished that, and some pretty incredible names. So that's the only thing I want to talk about was the dividend and the one last comment I have is what I've always said, and I'll say it again, I'm incredibly grateful. I'm grateful to my team. I'm grateful to Maria. I'm grateful to the Board. But the people who really get all the work done are the people on the front lines here at ADP, the 60,000 associates that make everything happen for us. There's something that Henry Taub put in the water that has created this culture, a can-do culture of delivering consistent results, not just from a financial standpoint before our clients. I think it's just fundamental to what we do to our DNA. And I'm so proud of our associates in terms of what I've seen them do throughout my career here at ADP, but particularly over the last three years, which were unbelievably challenging. And I know many other companies and many other employees of other companies stepped up to the plate. So I know that we're not unique, but I don't know what I know, and I only know the people I know, and they're great people doing great things every day for our clients. And that -- doing that is what has delivered the results that you guys enjoy as investors. So never forget that it all starts with our associates. I thank you for listening. This is my last earnings call after 44 of them. And like I said, I won the Super Bowl, and I like the analogy to the Dolphins. I'm not sure that I had a perfect season ever. I made plenty of mistakes, I learned from them and made myself and ADP a better and stronger company, but I definitely feel like I have one of those Super Bowl rings on. So I may have to go buy something a little bit bigger in terms of jewelry, so I can brag about it. But thanks again for listening to me all these years, putting up with me. And as I said, to our leaders and to our associates that I remain their servant leader, I remain your servant leader now moving on to becoming a shareholder and also to a Director. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Maria Black",
            "content": "Thank you, Carlos. You mentioned servant leadership, and I have to say that you are truly the embodiment of servant leadership. You have always kept our North Star true, which is putting our clients and our associates first. And I know I speak on behalf of all of our stakeholders, our associates, our shareholders, the communities we serve and the 1 million clients now we have the honor of serving and thanking you for everything that you've done over the decade that you served as our CEO. So my sincere thank you to you, Carlos.  I'm truly humbled and grateful for this opportunity and certainly for the confidence, Carlos that you've given me and that the Board has given me and entrusted me with this role. I am genuinely thrilled to lead ADP. You mentioned it, and it's true. I did start from the ground up. I started with this company 26 years ago, selling ADP's products and offering store-to-door. This ability to really see our clients from the front line has given me a vision and a true understanding of the client centricity that you mentioned that we embody as a company. And since selling 26 years ago door to door, I've served in roles all across ADP in sales and service, implementation, operations, including our PEO and SBS. I'm really, really proud of the role that we play in our clients' lives and how they trust us to really help them succeed in their HCM journey. For the last 73 years, we've had an amazing legacy and a culture. And that culture is really anchored in innovation and it's anchored in developing and providing technology and solutions that help address our clients' needs but also help address the needs of their workers. And I'm incredibly proud to be a part of that journey as we continue the modernization that we've been undergoing over the last few years. Of course, as you mentioned, none of this is possible without the 60,000 dedicated associates that we have that are at the center of absolutely everything that we deliver. I am committed to continuing to empower their great talent, which time and time again has reshaped the HCM industry through a relentless focus on again, solving our clients' needs and predicting their future needs. I'm also grounded by our history and our own beginning as a small business out of Paterson, New Jersey, founded by Henry Taub, a man who simply wanted to help local businesses. Then and now, I know and I feel deeply that this core value continues to define us as a company. So with that, thank you again, Carlos, and thank you to the Board. And now I will thank you in advance to all of our stakeholders in your confidence as we continue to build on ADP's incredibly strong results-oriented foundation. We continue to drive product innovation, leading technology. And more than anything, we continue deliver the consistent value creation that we're known for as the leader in the HCM industry.  So with that, I think it's appropriate to turn it over to the results this quarter. Thank you, Carlos. As I mentioned earlier, I am also proud of the collective efforts of our associates who made this achievement possible. One of the beauties of having 1 million clients and directly serving 3 million worksite employees in our HRO businesses is that we have unparalleled insight into the needs of the HR department, and we are putting that insight to work. I'm proud to share that, in September, we won the top HR product at annual HR Tech Conference for the eighth year in a row, this time for a new offering we're calling Intelligent Self-Service. HR departments today devote a significant amount of time to addressing questions from their workers to help better manage this volume of worker and practitioner interaction. Intelligent Self-Service uses predictive analytics to help proactively address common issues before workers need to contact or HR leaders. Not only does this solution ultimately improve the experience for the worker, but it further enables the practitioner to focus on more strategic items, which is a key objective for our clients. There are a few different components to Intelligent Self-Service. The first is something we're calling action cards, which you can think of as proactive nudges in the ADP mobile app that appear in the flow of work so that workers are alerted and encouraged to act when there's something they need to address such as a missed time punch or time card approval. Another component of the offering is our virtual assistant chatbot, which was previously available to our clients' HR practitioners but is now, for the first time, being expanded to workers as well in order to address their requests or questions. And the third piece is case management, which helps with more complex problems that require HR systems. This feature presents a streamlined way to create, manage and track workers' interactions with our HR experts and quickly get to the right experts based on the workers made. Intelligent Self-Service is designed to create a better HR experience and reduce work, and we believe we are designing a solution that can reduce our clients' case volume by 30% or more, which, of course, would be an incredibly value-add win for everyone. We have already rolled out some of these components and are in pilot for others, but the feedback so far has been very positive. I also want to give a quick Q1 update on our new user experience. As a reminder, our new user experience represents a significant enhancement we've been making to our scaled strategic platforms using new design principles to make them even more intuitive and more personal so our users can easily leverage our solutions to the fullest. Last year, we moved clients on RUN, iHCM and Next Gen HCM as well as the ADP Mobile app over to the new user experience. And later in the year, we also moved 20,000 Workforce Now clients to the new UX. Enhancing Workforce Now is especially important given how integral the platform is to so many of our businesses, and I'm pleased to now share we've taken that 20,000 clients last year to over 80,000 through the end of Q1 with essentially all of Workforce Now clients on this new enhanced experience. Among other user experience initiatives, we relaunched the ADP RUN mobile app with our new UX with managers and HR practitioners of small businesses running payroll and HR while on the go. This app is a powerful tool for them, and the relaunch has been a resounding success. You can see the app and the reviews for yourself, but it's doing phenomenally well with 4.9 stars on several thousand reviews representing meaningful improvement from the experience it is replacing. These are exactly the types of outcomes we had hoped to achieve with this user experience work, and we are very excited about continuing to roll out to more solutions within our key platforms. From our voice of employee offering, we mentioned last quarter to our new Intelligent Self-Service capability to our UX deployment into our ongoing Next Gen rollout, our product teams are busy and our clients are excited about the continued innovation at ADP and our overall modernization journey. We look forward to continuing to develop ways to provide more value to our clients and prospects in this dynamic HCM and economic environment and to ultimately deliver on our bookings growth goals for this year and beyond.  And with that, over to Don. Thank you, Pete, and thank you for the well wishes. I certainly appreciate them. And as you mentioned, look forward to connecting with many of you around strategic vision going forward. With respect to bookings and really thinking through year-on-year changes in behavior, I'll comment on that, and then I'll turn it over to Don that can talk about whether or not we have more room on price. . But again, just to kind of confirm the overall outlook at 6% to 9%, we do feel confident in this outlook. When I think about how we planned for the year, and we were generally pleased with the results that we saw in the first quarter, in fact, they were actually technically a record from a year-on-year perspective. But the thing that makes us not necessarily call that out in that way and really speaking to the continued momentum, to your question, it's really about in the context of the records that we've had, in the past few quarters, it's really been broad-based across every bit of the portfolio. And as you heard in the prepared remarks this morning, we had significant strength in our downmarket offerings. Really pleased to see that across our RUN portfolio, the small business segment inclusive of our insurance offerings, retirement offerings. We also continue to have significant strength in our HRO offerings, inclusive of the PEO. So in terms of changing behavior, I see that as constant behavior as it relates to -- those are businesses that have had continued strength over several quarters and the value proposition, both downmarket and certainly into the HRO space has been good. I think the area, again, that we called out a little bit that we're keeping an eye on is really our international business. Now the good news with our international business is that it's a small contributor to our overall bookings. But when we look at what really happened with the international space, specifically for this quarter, we don't still actually see a macro impact. We see more of an impact of the strength that we had coming into or coming off of a record Q4. And so when you think about our upmarket business, specifically our international business, there are times that it's a bit lumpy as we pull deals forward to accelerate through the fourth quarter. And candidly, who wouldn't want to have an incredible finish and an incredible quarter? But as it has for several decades, I would say that does sometimes lend itself to some of those businesses needing -- continue to rebuild the pipeline. So that's really what we think is happening. But at the same time, we're very -- we're keeping an eye on specifically in Europe, what's happening in the Ukraine, what's happening with the energy crisis. Those are watch items for us. But just kind of reiterate, we don't see any macro overall trends. We don't see changes in behavior. We see the strength continuing in the downmarket and into our HRO and PEO offerings, and we were very, very pleased with the results this quarter, and they are record results in that respect. Fair enough. Thank you for the chance to comment a little bit. Obviously, early days as it relates to -- I mean essentially starting as early days as it relates to having conversations around long-term strategy. I think the first thing I'd like to reiterate, I know I talked about my 26 years here. I have spent eight of those as part of the incredible management team that Carlos alluded to earlier, and that's been a part of the journey that we've been on as it relates to the overall modernization journey. So I think you mentioned the transition from payroll to HCM. That is a piece of that modernization. But in my mind, it's more broad-based than that. It's really been about the decisions we've made, everything from our strategic locations to early days of platform migrations to configuring our organization to really create a technology organization. We've been actively modernizing our service organization. You hear me speak about that all the time in terms of continuing the modernization of tools but also making sure that we're taking the work out for our clients. We've been making a transition to the public cloud. And then one of my favorite topics is the modern selling approach that we've been embarking upon that really, as we go on for many years as we found it inside sales, if you will, 20 years ago to the most recent during the pandemic, really focused on digital selling and meeting the buyers in a different way. So I think all of that is really about our modernization journey. And I think as I look forward into the next decade, if you will, in the next chapter, it is really about continuing the great work and the foundation that you mentioned that Carlos laid. I have a lot of passion around our clients. I have a lot of passion around the 40 million workers that they pay and how we can create value for each one of those stakeholders, both the workers as you mentioned, the clients' employees as well as our clients. And my ultimate goal, Carlos touched on it, I think I mentioned it as well upfront, when I think about client centricity and really solving meaningful things for our clients, I think the last decade in this modernization journey has really been about setting us up to be able to deliver value in a very different way for our clients. My goal would be to continue that journey and, in the end, make sure that our clients are in love with our products and in love with the experience that they have with ADP and the true evangelists of what it is that we bring. And I feel confident in how we've been set up to embark on that journey, and I look forward to sharing more with you on it as we move forward. Thank you, Jason, for the well wishes. And I'm actually -- I'm glad you asked this question because I wanted to make sure there's clarity around that 30%. And that 30%, just so we're all on the same page, it's really about our clients being able to save that time. So this is really about serving up, leveraging intelligence, artificial intelligence, machine learning. It's really serving us the most frequent interactions that can be either performed in a self-service capacity or really performed again through this case management and really taking the work out than necessarily, call it, taking the work out of our system. It's really about giving that 30% to our clients.  In fairness, it is early days as we measure this. And when I say that, I'd say that lightly in that we did study this across our 3 million HR worksite employees, if I may call them that, that in terms of the most frequent cases that get served up and what that would yield in terms of a return to our clients. And that's where that 30% comes from. But as we launch this product and more and more adoption happens, we will be keeping a keen eye on that outcome to ensure that, that number remains true, and our hope is to continue to make progress and take more work out of our -- out of the system for our clients as they navigate the relationship between them and the practitioners and the workers. Yes. Thank you, Carlos. He's right. Carlos is right. I've been studying deeply the pipeline specifically of these businesses that recognize bookings potentially have some of the pull forward into the fourth quarter. And that's primarily in the larger size type of organizations. And so in studying the pipeline kind of segment by segment, country by country, if you will, and deeply, it does appear that the pipelines are there, the pipelines are continuing to build when I think about deal cycle time, right? So you think about all the data points we are analyzing on a daily basis to really understand the question you're asking, Bryan, which is, is this an economic and macro, is this -- what is this. And the answer is, from a pipeline perspective, the pipelines are healthy. From a deal cycle time, let's go back to Carlos' commentary. It does appear that we did have a lot of pull forward, and there were potentially not enough days to pull things into the first quarter. And we have -- again, what does that really mean in the macro? It's really returning to more pre-pandemic levels. So these are not concerning deal cycle times. These are actually more normal deal cycle times, the ones that we saw pre-pandemic. What I'm referring to there is really there used to be a time that it did take a lot of time to move larger deals through the system because so many individuals are involved, whether that's on the contracting side, the legal side. During the pandemic, there was a deal acceleration that happened, and a lot of that has to do with us being stationary. That's no longer the case. We see that every day in terms of the world is back at work. And companies are reporting in the news, we are seeing incredible strength amongst our client base. We're seeing demand for HCM. There is 6% pays per control growth. So as Carlos mentioned earlier, the jobs are there. Our clients are growing. Our products and offerings fit right into that sweet spot that everybody is still trying to solve for, and our pipelines are healthy. So at this juncture, there really isn't a macro broad-based trend that we can see besides the watch areas we've called out. I think the only other comment I would make, I alluded to it earlier, and is please remember that when a quarter ago, we gave the guidance for the 6% to 9%. The way that we thought about the year, first and foremost, the first quarter is the lightest quarter for us from a pure dollar perspective. So it's the smaller contributor from a dollar perspective on the full year. The way that we planned the year, which we talked about on the 6% to 9% bookings guidance that we gave a quarter ago was really assuming some elements of a slowdown in the back half, specifically in the fourth quarter. So it's really about this quarter, i.e., the current one that we're in, which is the second quarter and the third quarter, and so in looking at where we stand today, we feel confident in the 6% to 9% in terms of how we plan for it. We didn't assume massive and severe recession, but we definitely have assumptions in there that we feel confident at this point that we can execute against. I have a lot of time for our new UX. I can't boast about it enough. And the majority of that reason is all of the above. We expect this to impact our clients' satisfaction, their retention, our ability to demo more, sell more. In terms of teasing out the specific results difficult, but the answer to your question is all of the above. Yes. Thanks, Mark. And similarly, I look forward to spending more time together, and I've appreciated the time thus far that we spent together getting to know each other. So in terms of selling season, we do feel -- I think Carlos mentioned, I think the first call-out I would make, I know you asked specifically about products and contributions PEPM, but I think it's important to go back to the discussion that Carlos had around headcount. So I've been -- I spent some of last year and last fiscal year speaking about a flattish headcount growth as it related to sales. We committed to a -- business growth heading into the quarter, and I'm pleased to report, as Carlos alluded to, that we are ahead of those plans. And so what that means is that we have more quota carriers in the system as we head into selling season, significantly more than we expected but significantly more than last selling season. And that, in and of itself, is the biggest contributor that we have to our overall results as we think about the productivity of more people in the system and, as Carlos also mentioned, with tenure of those associates picking up the increase in productivity of our sellers as they lap the 10-year band. So I think that's the biggest variable I see. We do have a lot of amazing things as it relates to products in the system. Certainly, the new user experience being broad-based across all of the products gives the sellers an extra step in their momentum as they head into the end of the year as it relates to demos due to that nature. I mentioned some of the other products such as the voice of the employee and our Intelligent Self-Service, which both serve us up through our mid-market. So that mid-market value proposition is continuing to grow. The other is the strength that we are seeing in that PEO and the HRO are comprehensive and managed services business -- businesses as it relates to customers that are continuing to face the complexity. By the way, whether they are up market, in the mid-market or even down market needing more of those tools to navigate the complexity of being an employer, and so we see tremendous strength there. And so we're making good progress on our Next Gen. Very pleased to see specifically on our Next Gen Payroll how that's resonating in the mid-market with Workforce Now. And as we continue to increase the addressable area that we are able to target with those offerings undoubtedly will yield, as you suggested, greater sales, greater PEPM as well some of these enhanced features and products that are served up through our existing platforms that I've mentioned before. Yes. So we are -- we committed to -- and I've been talking about kind of that 50% of our overall mid-market and Workforce Now clients, and we continue to make progress on that. So we're not entirely -- at the entire market that work with an outsource today. But each and every day, actually, in every release, we continue to clear the path for more and more opportunities to be able to participate in that Next Gen offering, which is truly the game changer for ADP as it relates to the innovation there."

            "content": "Thank you, Danny, and thanks, everybody, for joining the call. As you saw this morning in the news, we have a little bit more excitement than normal, but I promise you that 1.5 hours from now, we'll go back to our boring cells because we do have a business to run.  But before I talk about the quarter, I thought it was appropriate to just share a few thoughts given the transition from me to Maria as our new CEO. As you know, I'm going to continue as Exec Chair, but obviously, that's going to be a role primarily to supporting Maria and also helping the Board and not really involved in day-to-day operations. So it's definitely going to be my last earnings call, which is hard to say because it\u2019s been 44 earnings calls for me. But it's really been an incredible ride.  Obviously, I could thank a lot of people. One person in particular that I do want to call out is John Jones, who is going to remain our Lead Independent Director. And the combination of John and Les Brun before him were incredible mentors to me, incredibly helpful in providing advice and guidance on behalf of the Board. And also, I'm proud to call them friends. And I also want to thank Gary Butler and Art Weinbach, my predecessors who gave me the opportunity to be here today and also help me a lot in terms of making me the person I am and the leader that I am today. I'm proud of a couple of things. I'll just mention a few. One of them is I'm proud of our growth. We doubled our revenues over the last 10 or 11 years. And today, as you know, we reached an important milestone of 1 million clients. So I appreciate -- I wish I could say that it was anything other than a coincidence. But however it happened. It's a great thing to have happened here on my last earnings call. We made it through a lot of challenges, economic. We went through, what I would call financial repression in terms of interest rates, which fortunately now we have a little bit of the opposite situation, which we'll talk about today. So there's many QEs. I think there were three QEs over my tenure. And then the final straw that almost broke the camel\u2019s back was interest rates. Even on the 10-year going, I think it was like under 0.5% in the pandemic, which was really kind of incredible to see happen. We also made it through a pandemic that hopefully only happens every 100 years, and we had some dissident shareholders that also had some opinions about how to run ADP that we had to deal with. I'm also proud of our associates. I'm proud they've always said about their commitment to our clients and to ADP. There's something that my predecessors and the culture have around our client centricity, which is really remarkable, and our associates always step up to the plate and deliver in a business that, again, we don't get a lot of credit, and I know that we're not quite up there in terms of the list of first responders and people who save lives. But we do keep the economy going, and we do, I think, make sure that commerce worldwide operates smoothly. So our associates are the ones who get that done, and I'm proud of them. The person I'm most proud of is Maria. She's now been tested. She's prepared. She's been through a very thoughtful and long succession process, and she's going to be the -- what is only the seventh CEO of ADP. And I know that she's the right person starting from the ground up. I wish I could have said that because that's what makes this special, this place special. We love to bring in talent from the outside but we have some incredible people that grow up and know this place, understand this place and know how to make it continue to hum the way it's been humming for more than 70 years. Most importantly, she not only knows our industry, but she knows our clients' needs deeply and takes great interest in that. And that is going to serve us well, as well as for growth orientation, which I think is going to be very important for ADP's future. Last thing I'll say is that I recently told our team at a senior meeting that I tried -- I strive to be what I learned about many, many years ago, something called a servant leader. And I tried to be that way to my team and to my organization here at ADP. But I want all of you to know that I tried to be that also to all of you and to our shareholders, as much as I tried to be that way for our clients and our associates. It's been truly an honor of a lifetime to serve ADP\u2019s CEO. And we are kind of a company that likes to fly under the radar. We kind of like it that way. So I know that nobody is going to write any books about us or they may not be even writing articles about us today, but this is one of the most successful commercial enterprises in history. All I have to do is go back and look at the track record. Most people don't do that. They don't go back and look at the 10-year to 20-year and, in our case, the 50 year. The company went public in 1961. I encourage you to look at our history, our results and our TSR and compare it to some of the greatest investors and investments of all time. And I think you'll see that ADP ranks right up at the top. Anybody who knows me knows how much I love sports and how -- what a sports -- I am. So I was trying to think of an analogy. And I feel like not only did I join the championship team, but I won the Super Bowl being here at ADP. It's really been an incredible ride. But right now, it's time to pass the torch. It's always great to have change, especially in a company like ADP because I know you can rely on our consistent, predictable results, but we also have to continue to grow for decades to come. And the only way to do that is to bring in fresh thinking and to have change. And that's exactly what we're doing with Maria. So before I talk about the quarter and the results, I'm going to turn it over to Maria and let her say a few things. Thanks, Maria. Speaking of consistent value creation, let me start talking a little bit about the results here so we can get to the questions. We got off to a really strong start in fiscal 2023, with strong results that reflected the momentum we've been building for several quarters now. In Q1, we delivered 10% revenue growth, 11% on an organic constant currency basis, and this was driven by strength in a number of our businesses. And on top of that, we delivered 30 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion as our revenue outperformance helped us overcome elevated expense grow over from last year's first quarter as well as continued investments in the business, which we anticipated and communicated to you last quarter.  We delivered 13% adjusted EPS growth in the quarter, and we remain well positioned as we move ahead for the rest of the year. I'll cover a few highlights for the quarter before I turn it back over to Maria. Our new business bookings, we showed continued momentum through Q1 with demand strongest in our downmarket offering like RUN and our retirement services businesses, and we also continue to see strong traction in our PEO solution. At the same time, bookings growth in our international business started a bit softer than we had hoped. We're continuing to watch the demand environment in international markets as clients and prospects there are dealing with a number of uncertainties, as you know. We are keeping an eye on the macroeconomic environment as well, but overall demand remains strong, and our pipeline looks solid. We'll share further updates on what we're seeing with bookings as we progress through the year. Our ES retention was very strong with a new overall Q1 record level led by great performance in our mid-market. We accomplished this year-over-year improvement despite further normalization in small business out of business rates in the quarter. We assume we will continue to experience normalization in out-of-business rates towards prepandemic levels as the year progresses, and we are clearly very pleased with the Q1 results and -- that were better than expected. Our pays to control metric was 6% for the quarter, in line with our expectations as strong hiring that our clients have conducted these past few quarters has carried through to strong pays per control growth this quarter. We continue to expect deceleration in pays per control growth later this year, and we've seen sequential employment growth begin to slow both in the National Employment Report and in public data. But that said, job postings and other leading indicators within our client base suggest that, at the very least in the short term, demand for labor will remain solid. And moving on to our PEO. We saw a modest deceleration in average worksite employee growth in the average worksite employee growth rate, which was anticipated, but the 12% growth was slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter, and we're very pleased with that growth. Demand for both our PEO and our ES HRO offerings remains high as the value proposition for a fully outsourced model continues to resonate in the market. And in fact, our HRO businesses combine now to serve over 3 million worksite employees out of the 40 million total workers paid by ADP. Q1 not only provided a strong start to fiscal 2023 but also represented a major milestone in our company's history. As we -- as I mentioned earlier, we crossed the 1 million client mark during the quarter. What an incredible accomplishment. We accomplished this by driving improvement and growth on a consistent basis through decades of different employment cycles, business environments and technology shifts. It's a proud moment that was made possible only because of our relentless focus on meeting the needs of our clients, as Maria mentioned, both by delivering exceptional service and providing leading HCM technology. underpinning all of this is the dedication of our associates who ultimately make ADP a company it is today. As we look ahead, we recognize the need to remain agile in this unique and dynamic economic environment. And it is certainly our hope that inflation normalizes soon without significant harm to the global economy. But if macroeconomic conditions instead prove more challenging than we'd all like, we believe our stable business model should allow us to maintain our focus on innovation and our steady approach to investment, positioning us to continue driving long-term sustainable growth for many years to come. And it's for that reason that while I am incredibly excited to have reached 1 million clients, I'm even more excited about the opportunities ahead for ADP.  And I'll now turn it over to our new CEO, Maria. I think that was for you, Maria, given that I'll be sitting on the beach. Actually, it's a good question because, honestly, it's something that we started -- we were joking about it yesterday, that I started talking about this about 12 months after I became CEO. Not that I was trying to leave 12 months after I became CEO. But in case people haven't noticed, I'm like a business junky, right? So I just love business. I also love kind of the whole idea of like a successful commercial enterprise, and you have this kind of tension in this area of succession where the longer you are around, the more you know. There's some studies out there that show that beyond a certain amount of time is really when CEOs hit their stride. But then there's an equal amount of research that shows you move beyond a certain time, you become stale. You don't have any new ideas. You become enamored with your own ideas and thoughts. And so I have not written the book on this, but I read a lot of books on this. And my sense was that kind of beyond seven years was -- there was diminishing returns based on my \"research.\" And you can see that I made it past that. And some of that was -- circumstances, I think, made it such because I didn't have any specific goal. Like I'm not trying to run out the door. My -- the only thing I want to do is the best thing for ADP, and the best thing in this case now for Maria and for our Board. And so this is a collective decision over -- I know it's hard to believe but really over a decade as to what the right timing was, who the right person was and how to position them for success and how to position the company for success. By the way, that also involves -- we had a very meaningful refreshment of our Board that, I think, is something that has to be taken into context because it's all a package, right? It's the right CEO, the right Board, the right Board leadership. And so I think that bringing the Board along, I think, required a little bit more time than I had expected. So that's a long way of saying I don't have any magic answers to what the right time is. What I know for sure is not the right way to do it. There's nothing to do with my age and whether I'm young or I'm old or whatnot. It has to be done when it's the right time and it's the best thing for ADP, and I think that's what we just did. Thank you. So we obviously don't have the market cornered on economic forecast. We do have a reasonable amount of data, particularly on what I would call the near-term next few quarters, I would say. But when you look at the last two, three, five years, 10 years, really, as long as I've been doing this, you have to be really careful about taking economic forecasts at face value. So you have to be careful. You have to be prepared for all eventualities. And that's why we like to call ourselves an all-weather business model because I think we actually perform, I think, through a variety -- obviously, better in some than others. But I guess that's the way of saying we're not obsessed with economic forecast because if I had taken economic forecast at face value over the last three or four years, we would have made numerous mistakes. And I think all I have to do is go back. I know nobody does this because otherwise there wouldn't be -- economists wouldn't exist. But if you look at what economists forecast 12 months prior and then what actually happened or 20 months prior to what actually happened, that's not really the right way to run a business. But it doesn't inform our decisions right, and our planning.  And as you mentioned, what happened this year in terms of our fiscal year planning is we thought -- kind of common sense told us that some of these things were going to happen like normalization of downmarket retention, right, towards hopefully still above pre-pandemic levels but not at the kind of levels they were when the government was providing so much support for small businesses that you could just see it in the data in terms of the drop in bankruptcies and out of business and so forth. So we expected some normalization there. Likewise, pays per control, it's not -- you just don't make numbers up. Like we -- if you assume that you reach kind of \"full employment\", and that the population and employment [Audio Gap] employable people is growing at a certain rate, you can kind of back into kind of a normalized pays per control rate, and then you sprinkle in a little bit -- maybe there's going to be some economic weakness in the back half. And I think what we signaled and what we have in our plan is, I think, kind of flattish pays per control growth, which to me personally is feeling conservative right now based on the -- we feel like we have this kind of continued strength into this quarter, and that typically doesn't fall off the cliff right away. But maybe that happens in the first quarter of '24 that it becomes flattish. I don't know. But I know that right now, there are definitely still -- we got back to what employment was pre pandemic, but the population also grew and the employable number of people grew. So labor force participation is still below where it was before. So there is definitely still room for some employment growth there. So this could be a very strange slowdown, right, or if you want to call it a recession, where it's, I think Danny calls it a labor full recession where it doesn't feel like employment, at least the stuff that we look at background checks, job postings, et cetera. I mean if you look at the jokes, you look at everything, there's still a lot of -- we had 260,000 jobs created -- and that wasn't 500,000, it wasn't 1 million, but in any other environment, that would be like an incredibly strong number, but it's clearly is clearly slowing, but everything we see is that the labor markets remain, again, in the time horizon that we have visibility to pretty strong or certainly not as strong as a year ago or when we were in the middle of the recovery from the pandemic, but that's really more of the comparisons than kind of anything underlying.  So I think we're just heading back to kind of more normal rates, but in an unusual way where the labor market doesn't appear to be the leading the leader in the slowdown. It appears to be people spending less on stuff that they spent a lot of during the pandemic, if I can be bold. That might be like exercise bicycles. It might be things like grills, like -- and maybe even, unfortunately, for a company that's close to my heart, software, right, and some things that are -- that you have these kind of, unfortunately, fluctuations of demand that we've never seen before. And so the now how do you predict and forecast how that all kind of lands in the medium to longer term. It's very, very hard for any company to do. But specifically for us, labor is still strong. As long as labor is strong, our clients are still looking for tools to employ, to hire and to manage that labor. And we have this other little weird thing happening to us, which is really fantastic, which is interest rates are rising. And they\u2019re rising in the face -- I mean, typically, when interest rates are rising, the economy is slowing, and that's exactly obviously what the intent of the Fed is. But right now, you're kind of at this point where we're getting this big tailwind from interest rates, and it doesn't feel like that's going to change again in the near term. It doesn't mean that rates won't stop increasing, but if rates stop increasing, like, for example, like in the spring of '23, and they stay there, home run for ADP. All of you and everybody internally here at ADP make fun of me when I used to talk about how our balances in 2008 were like $15 billion and they had grown to $30 billion, but our client funds interest had been cut almost by 2/3 because of interest rates. And I used to say, \"Can you imagine if interest rates go back to where they -- near back to where they were back then, but our balance is now are $33 million and growing, I think it was 9.5% this quarter, wouldn't that be amazing?\" And that's exactly what's happening. So I'm leaving a little bit of gas in the tank for Maria. Well, actually, I can't take credit for that. I appreciate Chairman Powell helped with that. But we -- I think we have some gas in the tank here with interest rates as well, which again, is a little unusual, but I don't know if you want to call it a hedge to our business model, but -- it's definitely welcome because we are -- as you know, we always carefully watch our expenses and everything in ADP, but it's a much better place to be from an ability to invest and an ability to weather when you have this significant tailwind, which is not a secret. I mean I think Don laid out the numbers, and you can do the math. It's a pretty big tailwind. Well, that's fair. But I'm pretty happy with the results because we -- Don, this is just the way our culture is. So everybody is talking about all the positives that we have, like interest income and so forth. But we had some headwinds as well. Like our T&E is up significantly. Remember, last -- it's hard to remember that last year, this quarter, I think we were still in the whole Omicron thing. It was just starting and we really hadn't opened up most of our buildings. I think our salespeople were for sure in the field but not traveling and spending the way they are now. By the way, we were very grateful that we have them back in the field. . So like there are a couple of things like T&E is the smallest of them. The biggest one is when you look at our headcount numbers, it hasn't come up yet, but our sales force is I think, more than fully staffed. And as you probably heard from our comments six to nine months ago, it was difficult to get there back then. Now not only are we fully staffed but our turnover is coming down across the board not just in sales but also across the rest of the organization. So all of a sudden, if you look at our headcount growth for this quarter, it is what I would call a peak and the highest I have ever seen since I've been here at ADP. That was necessary because there was some catch-up, which is why we -- I called it a grow-over issue from last year's first quarter, where we were definitely understaffed, didn't have enough people. And then all of a sudden, our revenues actually were outperforming. The number of clients is outperforming, and you know how important retention is to us. So we set to basically stop up across the Board implementation, service and sales. And that's when you had that whole great resignation thing happening at the same time. And it was -- I mean, again, I don't think most companies go around talking about this, but we were trying to hire as fast and as many people as we could at that point. The good news is we were successful. I think the better news is that puts us in, I think, in a good position in terms of staffing and sales, but also in terms of our service and implementation organizations. And now with declining turnover again, from a plan standpoint, besides planning for patient for control to be \"flattish\" in the second half, our headcount growth declines -- the growth of headcount declines every quarter for the next 4 quarters. And I think that, I think, should help us feel good about this quarter and also about the fiscal year. So I think technically, Don is correct. By the way, if you go back to ADP's 10-year history, this has been a weird two or three years like us not raising as we hadn't raised in the quarter, again, I don't know what you would have thought of that or what it would have meant, but I think that's pretty -- any maybe can confirm or tell me I'm wrong, but like we weren't in the habit of changing a lot in the first quarter because this is -- how can we say this is a predictable, stable business that we know what we're doing and then changing set every quarter. It doesn't make sense. Now we have a pandemic, that's a different story. Like we struggled like everyone else to kind of keep a handle on what things were happening -- how things were happening on the way down and also on the way back up. But this is going to be a much more stable environment. I would hope some of you would welcome that. But with 10%, 11% growth organic and our headwinds from expenses abating here a little bit, I think we're in a pretty good position. Yes. I think Maria can talk about -- I think she's actually been looking into a lot of the details around pipeline disorder. The only thing that I would add is color commentary. I was trying to defer to Maria on kind of the big picture in terms of bookings. But since I've been doing this for a long time, 44 quarters and then many years kind of watching from, I guess, a year before that as not quite a year, but as President, and before that, I really paid close attention to all this stuff. And Maria mentioned it, but the problem with the crystal ball right now is that when we have the kind of finish we had, you saw how enthusiastic we were and how bullish we were in terms of our finish and whatnot. And almost predictably, when we have that kind of finish, about half of our business, we count the bookings when we sign a contract. And the other half, we only count the bookings once the client starts. And that portion of the business that -- like, by the way, that's the way most companies that sell to larger clients book their bookings, which is when you sign a contract. That's why it's called bookings. That has always been an issue when we have this very strong quarter and very strong finish, the pull-forward stuff has been driving me crazy forever because we have very strong incentives and what we call accelerators in terms of commissions and so forth that drive, and we want that because we want to get the revenue as quickly as possible, but that sometimes leads to kind of a weaker start. The problem here is that on top of that, now you have a macroeconomic challenge potentially, we definitely have a macroeconomic challenge in Europe. Luckily, it's not a huge part our bookings. So it's hard to differentiate. But what I would tell you, again, back to color, the businesses that we count the bookings when they start are mostly the downmarket businesses. So that would be SBS, PEO, et cetera. We had double-digit bookings growth in those businesses. That makes me think that it's unlikely that, all of a sudden, we have an economic whatever challenge or disaster because why would those businesses still be performing the way they are. But I would just -- a forward-looking statement, I would say I don't know for sure that that there isn't a problem in terms of demand or the economy or whatnot, but it doesn't feel from the first quarter like we could put our finger on something that says, holy cow, we have to put the kind of the red flag or the yellow warning flag up just yet. And I don't know, Maria, if you have comments in terms of a little bit more tangible\u2026 And one of the -- if I can just add like one of the beauties of our business model is that bookings are, for sure, an incredibly important thing, especially kind of over the longer term. But I mean, I hope it's obvious that, from a revenue standpoint, again, with visibility only for the next two, three quarters, we have -- it's really about converting prior sales, which were incredibly strong in prior bookings. I mean you saw what our bookings results were for the fourth quarter and for the year. So that's the stuff that now turns into revenue in those businesses where we recognize the booking at the time we sign a contract. So that -- it's just -- I know it's obvious but just a reminder because this business doesn't -- we're not selling widgets, where if you stop selling widgets, like all of a sudden you're back to zero next quarter, like the -- I think we have a solid revenue plan that I think reflects, as Maria said, what I think was already a pretty conservative number in terms of bookings growth, particularly in the back half of the year. So we may have other issues like FX on the negative side, clients fund interest may help even more or may help less, but I don't think the bookings issue is a fiscal '23 focus item in terms of impact on revenue. It's really -- I think it's -- the controllable factors, I think, are the most satisfying part of the whole story because the story is kind of playing out a little bit the way we expected, which is small business is kind of in the process of kind of normalizing. But the really -- by the way, positive ironically in our international business, which might not be so ironic because the challenges economically, there are probably getting -- convincing people that they stay put. I don't want to say that it's not all great execution because we have a great leader in international, and we have the former great leader of international here, which is Don McGuire. So there's a lot of great things that have happened in that business that are probably powering some underlying improvement in retention. So some of it is probably inertia as a result of what's happening in the economic environment there. But the most satisfying part of the whole story here is what's happening in the mid-market, where I think some fundamental improvements that we made pre-pandemic, you remember all the pain in terms of the migrations and then the improvements in product, the UX experience improvements, all those things, it just seems like it's ratcheted up the \"potential\", the maximum potential retention, if you will, for our mid-market business, which was a record this quarter as well. Clearly, the down market -- the pace of normalization of the down market has some impact. But the big story, I think, this quarter was really the mid-market, and our international business has helped a lot on the retention side. I have nothing to add other than -- I obviously picked the right time to retire. Very well said. And because I think that encapsulates lots of other things where we focus more on the longer-term in the medium term rather than because, again, if rates do normalize, as you said, we're going to be very grateful that we -- that our extended portfolio that we took advantage of these \"higher rates\" that will help us for two, three, in some cases, five years down the road. So it's the right -- we're not a financial services company. We're not a bank, and that's not the kind of best that we're trying to make here. This is just -- happens to be a nice little windfall as a result of a business model that we have that allows us to kind of manage float income at a very, very large scale. And anyway, well said. Yes, listen, I appreciate that because I joke around with people that I used to actually watch TV and sports a long time ago, but there was like about a 20-year period where I have no idea what's going on. But I do know Don Shula and I know the goose egg defense, I think they were called to say, whatever the hell they were. So no-name defense. There you go there. I screwed it up. It was trying to prove that I actually knew something about sports and I blew it so. But I appreciate that. That's greatly appreciated. You're a class act yourself, Mark. Thank you. Yes. And I think the simple math is, again, rather than getting into individual quarters because that talk about trying to like -- it's very hard to pin down that exact number. But I think ballpark, 6 for the first half, zero for the second half, gets you to 2 to 3 that you have for the full year. I mean that's probably the right -- obviously, the way we laid it out is slightly different than that but that's close enough, I think, for what you're trying to accomplish, I think. The only -- the other color commentary that I would add is, I think the PEO -- again, if you look at last year, it's obviously, we've seen, as expected, some deceleration, but I would call 12% employee growth is still pretty strong. That obviously requires investment, right, in terms of service, implementation expense, et cetera. And so I would say that the PEO is one of those places where we were really adding a lot in terms of expense and resources from a place where we were not where we needed to be, call it, last year's first quarter. So that's the poster child, I think, for this kind of grow-over expense situation that we have. But the good news is, I think, is we are -- we're staffed. Again, turnover is improving across the board in terms of all parts of ADP. And I'm talking to other CEOs, I think this is happening kind of across. Things are just kind of settling down. That helps a lot because improvements in tenure help a lot in terms of productivity and just getting the work done. Well, what can I say? Another disappointing quarter where no one asked about the dividend. So let me just say that if the Board -- obviously I don't want to get ahead of the Board, but if the Board approves a dividend increase in November, this will be our 48th year of increasing dividends, which I think is a pretty elite group out there. And if you look at our payout ratio and you assume the Board will want to stay in the same payout ratio, you can do the math in terms of what's going to happen with our dividend. I think people really way underestimate. I hope this doesn't become an environment where for the next 10 years people are very focused on dividends because that has its own negative implications. But if you look at over 50 years or 70 years or 100 years, dividends matter, right? And compounding growth of dividends matters a lot. If you look at ADP's return, I'm doing a little math since we went public, which is why I was bragging about this being one of the most successful commercial enterprises in history. And again, and all of you have the same HP 12C calculators, you do that math, it's a pretty important driver of overall returns. So I'm incredibly proud of that. Maria gets to be the person who will preside over the celebration, again, forward-looking statements assuming we get there, of reaching 50 years, which will make us a dividend king. And I think there's only like less than 15 companies that have accomplished that, and some pretty incredible names. So that's the only thing I want to talk about was the dividend and the one last comment I have is what I've always said, and I'll say it again, I'm incredibly grateful. I'm grateful to my team. I'm grateful to Maria. I'm grateful to the Board. But the people who really get all the work done are the people on the front lines here at ADP, the 60,000 associates that make everything happen for us. There's something that Henry Taub put in the water that has created this culture, a can-do culture of delivering consistent results, not just from a financial standpoint before our clients. I think it's just fundamental to what we do to our DNA. And I'm so proud of our associates in terms of what I've seen them do throughout my career here at ADP, but particularly over the last three years, which were unbelievably challenging. And I know many other companies and many other employees of other companies stepped up to the plate. So I know that we're not unique, but I don't know what I know, and I only know the people I know, and they're great people doing great things every day for our clients. And that -- doing that is what has delivered the results that you guys enjoy as investors. So never forget that it all starts with our associates. I thank you for listening. This is my last earnings call after 44 of them. And like I said, I won the Super Bowl, and I like the analogy to the Dolphins. I'm not sure that I had a perfect season ever. I made plenty of mistakes, I learned from them and made myself and ADP a better and stronger company, but I definitely feel like I have one of those Super Bowl rings on. So I may have to go buy something a little bit bigger in terms of jewelry, so I can brag about it. But thanks again for listening to me all these years, putting up with me. And as I said, to our leaders and to our associates that I remain their servant leader, I remain your servant leader now moving on to becoming a shareholder and also to a Director. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Don McGuire",
            "content": "Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter represented a strong start to the year with 10% revenue growth on a reported basis and 11% growth on an organic constant currency basis. Our EBIT margin was up 30 basis points, coming in above our expectations as strong overall revenue growth and growing clients fund interest revenue contribution as well as favorable workers' compensation reserve adjustments in our PEO overcame inflation-related cost pressures and higher-than-typical year-over-year headcount growth. Our robust revenue and margin performance combined to drive 13% adjusted EPS growth for the quarter supported by our ongoing return of cash to our investors via share repurchases. In our Employer Services segment, increased 9% on a reported and 11% on an organic constant currency basis. Key drivers to this growth were strong bookings and retention performance we delivered in recent quarters as well as solid contributions from price and pays per control. And of course, client funds interest, which mostly benefits the ES segment, grew nicely in Q1 with 39% growth driven by a healthy 9% balance growth and 40 basis point improvement in average yield. Partially offsetting that was FX, which was a slightly bigger headwind than we had anticipated. Our ES margin increase of 50 basis points was higher than planned primarily as a result of that strong revenue growth. For our PEO, revenue in the quarter grew 13%. Average worksite employees increased 12% on a year-over-year basis to $704,000 as bookings and same-store pays both continue to perform well, though the same-store pays contributed less than it did in recent quarters as we expected. PEO margin increased 80 basis points in the quarter due primarily to revenue growth and favorable workers' compensation reserve adjustments. Let me now turn to our updated outlook for fiscal '23. I think, overall, you'll find a very steady outlook compared to our prior guidance with upside due in part to higher interest rates.  Beginning with the ES segment revenues, we now expect growth of 7% to 8% and driven by the following key assumptions. First, we continue to expect ES new business bookings to grow between 6% and 9%. And as Carlos covered, we see a stable overall demand environment at this time, but it's still early in the year. And with a wide range of outcomes and we will continue to watch for impact from a potentially slowing global economy as we progress from here. For ES retention, we were happy to deliver another strong quarter, but we believe it's prudent to anticipate further normalization of small business out of business rates as we move through fiscal '23. As such, at this time, we're leaving our outlook unchanged at down 25 basis points to 50 basis points. Meanwhile, we will look to maintain our strong retention levels in our other business units. For pays per control, we had healthy 6% growth in Q1, in line with expectations, and we continue to anticipate a return to a more typical 2% to 3% growth rate for the full year as employment growth moderates. As we discussed last quarter, our pays per control growth outlook assumes a deceleration in growth in Q2 and very little growth in the second half of fiscal '23. This could, of course, prove to be either too conservative or bullish depending on how macroeconomic factors develop, but it still feels like a reasonable assumption to make at this point. Last quarter, we spoke a bit about price, and there is no change to our expectation for price to contribute about 100 basis points to 150 basis points to our ES revenue growth in fiscal '23. Our clients understand these price increases and recognize that they reflect our own cost pressures. And for client funds interest revenue, we now expect higher average rates compared to our prior outlook. Our client funds short portfolio will continue to benefit as the Federal funds rate increases over the balance of the fiscal year, and our new investments in our client extended and loan portfolios are now expected to yield about 4.3%. Between those two drivers, we now expect the average yield on our client funds portfolio to be 2.4% in fiscal '23, which is about 20 basis points higher than our prior outlook. We continue to expect our client funds balances to grow 4% to 6%. And putting those together, we now expect our client funds interest revenue to increase to a range of $790 million to $810 million in fiscal '23, up $70 million from our prior outlook. Partially offsetting this revenue upside is higher short-term borrowing costs associated with our client funds extended strategy. With higher expected commercial paper and reverse repo rates over the rest of the year, we now expect the net impact from our client fund's extended strategy to be $720 million to $740 million in fiscal '23, up $45 million from our prior outlook. One last factor to consider is our ES -- in our ES revenue outlook is FX headwind, which has unfortunately become a more meaningful drag over the last three months. We're now factoring in an FX headwind closer to 2% for fiscal '23 ES revenue, up slightly from our prior assumption. For ES margin, we now expect an increase of 200 basis points to 225 basis points, up 25 basis points from our prior outlook. We continue to expect our margins to benefit from our strong revenue growth outlook, including growth in client funds interest revenue, and we're pleased to be able to increase our outlook accordingly. Moving on to the PEO segment, where we're making very few changes. We continue to expect PEO revenue and PEO revenue excluding zero margin pass-throughs to grow 10% to 12%. The primary driver for our PEO growth is our outlook for average worksite employee growth of 8% to 10%. We now expect PEO margin to be flat to up 25 basis points in fiscal '23, narrowing our prior range higher due in part to the strong Q1 margin performance. Adding it all up, we now expect consolidated revenue growth of 8% to 9% in fiscal '23 and adjusted EBIT margin expansion of 125 basis points to 150 basis points. We still expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '23 to be about 23%, and we now expect adjusted EPS growth of 15% to 17% supported by our steady share repurchases.  And now I'll turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Yes. And with respect to the pricing, we've been very happy with our ability to execute the price increase in the way we did. And as we've said on prior calls, we're mindful of the fact that these are incremental costs for our clients as well, and we need to be competitive. So we made sure that we've price increased and passed on the costs we have in a way that keeps our customers with us for a very, very long time. Having said that, we said 100 basis points to 150 basis points. And I would tell you that, currently, we're pushing towards the upper end of that range in the price increase. So we've done very well against expectations and executed, as I said, well across the business. Of course, is there more available? Good question. If we look at our client base, particularly with the large clients, we do have contractual obligations that come due from time to time. And a number of those are tied to various price indices, et cetera. So that limits the ability to do anything beyond some of the pricing indices that drive or undermine or underlay, if you will, the price that we have. But I guess I would say we've been very happy with where we are now, and we'll always look to see if there's an opportunity. But I think that we want to make sure -- we will continue to make sure that we do what's best for ADP in the long term as opposed to being too overzealous, if you will, with short-term price increases. I think it's -- certainly, the rates helped us. But just a couple of things to comment on. Certainly, we still we're performing well against our internal expectations on margin improvement. So we're still very focused on spend and efficiency of spend, et cetera. But I don't think that we would have been as -- we wouldn't have been as eager to raise expectations in the absence of interest rates, especially given it's still Q1, and we need a little bit of time to see how things progress over the next couple of quarters. Yes, I'm going to start on this, but something tells me Carlos won't be able to resist following up on whatever I have to say here. So I guess I would say that the laddering strategy that was implemented a number of years ago has delivered great returns. And while I think everyone can see the temptation of changing the duration and trying to benefit more from short-term rates, rates will either normalize or they may even come down again at some point in the future. So this laddering strategy that's been deployed over the number of years has served us very well, and we expect it will continue to serve us well. And not to say that this question doesn't come up from time to time if we discuss it. But every time that we look at it, we -- you really either -- you're making a bet for today as opposed to for down the road. And given the positive experience we've had, it doesn't really behoove us to make any substantial changes to a policy and a program that has been doing very, very well. Carlos, I'm sure... Yes. So I think we were happy with 6% growth in the first quarter. And once again, back to Carlos' earlier comments, if you had believed all the economic forecasts, you might not have been expecting to see that stronger growth in pays per control. But we do continue to see the pays per control growth moderating down in the first half of this year. And as we shared -- as I shared in the prior -- the prepared comments, we have virtually zero pays per control growth in the back half of the year. So we do expect that we should -- given the strength of the first quarter, the first half should be a little bit better. I think we've reflected that in some of our guidance here already. And as we go through the next few months, we will be in a position to better decide whether we think we're going to be bullish or bearish on what's going to happen in the back half. And quite frankly, I think we'd all like to be very bullish about what's going to happen based on the first quarter's results, but I think if we did that, we'd kind of look a little bit foolish given all the predictions and all the storm clouds that people are talking about. So 6% first quarter slowing for the first half and then essentially very little growth if any, in the back half is what we're looking at. Sure. I mean, I can give you the specific numbers, you'll see them later in the Q anyway. So the -- we had a $14 million positive adjustment in the first quarter, and that compares to a $10 million positive adjustment in the first quarter of last year. So not that significant, $4 million, give or take. So that's the -- those are the raw numbers. We do not expect to see as good a reserve release in this fiscal year as we saw last year. There's still several quarters to go through, and the actuarials let us know what those numbers are, but we are contemplating the same level of reserve adjustment or recovery as we did in FY '22."

I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the conference over to Matt Keating, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Keating : Thank you, Michelle, and welcome, everyone to ADP's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you also find the Investor Presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. The description of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. I'll now turn it over to Maria.\nMaria Black : Thank you, Matt and good morning. Before we get started, I'd like to take a minute to thank Danyal Hussain for leading Investor Relations for these past several years. He helped lead us through the pandemic and helped Shepherd our CFO and CEO transitions during his time. With Danny moving on to a broader role, it is my pleasure to officially welcome Matt Keating to his first call. Congratulations to you both. We closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter that included 6% revenue growth, 80 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion and 11% adjusted EPS growth. For fiscal 2024, we delivered 7% revenue growth, 70 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion, and 12% adjusted EPS growth, representing another great year for ADP. I'm excited to share the progress we've made across our three strategic priorities, but first I'll start off with some additional highlights from our results. Our sales and marketing team delivered exceptional employer services, new business bookings in Q4, on top of a strong Q4 last year. This performance was broad based, showing continued strength in our small business portfolio, as well as our mid-market enterprise and international businesses. In fact, we sold and started more than 50,000 new small business clients during the quarter, which not only reflects the strength of our run solution, but also our reputation for commitment to strong service. Similarly, in the enterprise space, client interest in our next-gen HCM solution has exceeded expectations and resulted in strong Q4 sales, and we are excited to continue this great momentum. As a result of this exceptional performance, our fiscal 2024 employer services bookings growth came in at 7%, the high end of our 4% to 7% guidance range. This growth speaks to the power of ADP's unmatched distribution model, which remains a clear competitive advantage for us. With our new business pipeline even stronger than this time last year, we look forward to building on that momentum. Overall, our employer services retention came in better than expected for the year at 92%. We drove record level retention in our mid-market business for the second consecutive year in fiscal 2024. I'm also extremely proud to share that our client satisfaction scores for our total business reached new all-time highs for both the fourth quarter and full year. These results are a testament to the strength of our entire product portfolio and our commitment to supporting our clients. We are confident that these client satisfaction gains will support our retention results moving forward. Our employer services pays per control increased 2% both for the quarter and the full year. We were happy to have seen the resilience of the US Labor market, as our clients continued to hire employees at a moderate pace. Finally, our fourth quarter PEO revenue growth of 6% exceeded our expectations despite continued pressure from slowing client hiring activity. Our fiscal 2024 accomplishments extend far beyond our strong financial results. One year ago, I laid the foundation for our three strategic priorities that will guide our future growth. Now, I'd like to recap some of the great progress we made in each of these areas. Our first priority is to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. We had a very busy year on this front as we launched ADP Assist, our cross-platform solution powered by generative AI that transforms client data into actionable insights. This isn't just another technical solution, it's an experience that combines ADP's deep data set and expertise to empower HR professionals, leaders, and employees. We deployed ADP Assist across several of our platforms, including [Roll] (ph), RUN, Workforce Now, and next-gen HCM, with enhanced capabilities ranging from report creation to natural language search to initiating HR actions. These tools streamline daily tasks and are all powered by an easy-to-use search interface that is already receiving meaningful recognition in the field of generative AI. We are very proud to share that ADP Assist earned the Generative AI Innovation Award in the 2024 AI Breakthrough Awards, and we look forward to rolling out even more features in fiscal 2025. In addition to embedding generative AI in our products, we continued to advance our next-gen initiatives. Our active next-gen payroll client count increased by nearly 50% in fiscal 2024, and we grew our number of live next-gen HCM clients by more than 30% as we continued to improve implementation times. Our next priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing. Our approach to supporting our clients has been key to our winning formula for decades. And in fiscal 2024, we focused our efforts on implementing new technology that will help make an even greater impact for our clients. To further unlock the value of our expertise, we deployed generative AI tools like call summarization and real-time guidance to support our service associates. We also invested in generative AI and other automation capabilities for our implementation teams to reduce manual data entry and minimize the risk of error during implementation. For example, out of the 50,000 new RUN clients we sold and started during the fourth quarter, about half were digitally onboarded compared to a third of our new client onboarding and run this time last year. And as generative AI capabilities advance, we are excited to further accelerate this progress. Finally, we plan to provide additional tools to help our associates deliver better, faster service and allow our client satisfaction scores to continue reaching new record levels. Our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients with our global scale. Globally, we bring together an unmatched footprint, best-in-class integrated solutions, and industry-leading service and expertise to help our clients and their employees navigate the changing world of work. In fiscal 2024, we continued to leverage this global scale to strengthen our business. We extended our global footprint, acquiring the payroll business of our partner in Sweden, expanding the scope of our Celergo payroll offering to include Iceland, and further growing our on-the-ground presence in the APAC region. Our iHCM platform also continued to scale in several European countries and now serves more than 5,000 clients and pays more than 1 million client employees. Finally, we deepened our existing partnerships with several other leading technology providers to further simplify HCM processes and broaden the spectrum of support we can provide our clients. Next, I'd like to share some new client wins from Q4 to highlight how we're leading in workforce innovation and delivering value for our clients. In US Small business, we continue to successfully onboard new retirement services clients across multiple industry verticals. During the quarter, we added the plan of a Texas-based insurance agency, which was challenged by manual processes and the management of multiple providers. ADP's advanced technology and planned [fiduciary] (ph) solutions simplified the client's plan administration, reduced its manual oversight, and lowered its plan fees. The ADP team made the transition easy and stress-free by providing the client with critical management of the transfer process, as well as regular briefings on the plan set up. This is just one of the thousands of new clients who turn to our retirement services solution every year. In fact, we recently took the top spot as the nation's largest 401(k) record keeper by Total Plans and Total 401(k) Plans in the Plan Sponsor Magazine 2024 defined contribution Record Keeping Survey. We serve over 170,000 retirement services clients and it brings me great joy to see how ADP is helping employers address the retirement savings needs of so many Americans. We look forward to continuing the momentum in our retirement services business in fiscal 2025. In our HR outsourcing business, an orthopedic device company who had grown extensively through acquisition recognized it needed a deeper HR and technology infrastructure to support its future growth. So it turned to our comprehensive services support model to integrate its acquired companies onto a common platform. We look forward to supporting this client's current needs and helping it expand in the future. Additionally, comprehensive services cost a major milestone in fiscal 2024, generating more than $1 billion in revenue for the year. This business has come a long way since its launch in 2008, and we look forward to leaning into our outsourcing business as a differentiator. In US Enterprise, we welcomed one of the largest automotive dealers in the Midwest to our next-gen HCM platform. Following several years of rapid growth, this client wanted to reimagine their HCM strategy. To help, our team went on-site and conducted a deep review of its current practices and pain points. We developed a plan that would leverage our next-gen HCM platform, flexible position management structure and other advanced HCM tools to address the organization's current and future HR strategy. Our initial solution included HR, payroll, time, and benefits, and the client later added recruiting and talent management. We look forward to helping shape the future of their workforce together. Overall, we were extremely pleased with our strong financial and strategic outcomes this past year. In fiscal 2024, ADP was recognized as the world's most admired company by Fortune magazine for the 18th consecutive year, and we also celebrated our 30th straight year on the Fortune 500. As some of you may know, 2024 is also our 75th anniversary. As I reflect on ADP's enduring impact on the world of work, the one constant on our journey is our talented associates, be it the recent accolades we received or the 75 years of support for our clients, we owe our recognition and strong financial performance to our 64,000 dedicated associates who deliver the great products and exceptional experiences and continue to drive our client satisfaction scores to new highs. I want to take a moment to recognize them for their incredible contributions. Thank you for all you do for ADP and for our clients. And now I'll turn the call over to Don.\nDon McGuire : Thank you, Maria. And good morning, everyone. I'll start by expanding on Maria's comments around our Q4 results and then cover our fiscal 2025 financial outlook. Q4 performance was very strong overall, helping to drive fiscal 2024 revenue and earnings growth towards the high end of our expectations. As previously mentioned, we benefited from broad-based strengths in employer services with exceptional new business bookings, better than anticipated retention, and stable pays per control growth. PEO revenue growth in the quarter also came in better than expected. Our strong Q4 results contributed to our full year revenue growth of 7%, bringing our fiscal 2024 revenue to $19.2 billion. For our employer services segment, revenue in the quarter increased 7% on both a reported and organic constant currency basis. These results were bolstered by a slightly better than expected contribution from client funds interest. Our ES margin expanded 220 basis points in the fourth quarter, which exceeded our expectation. For the full year, our ES revenue grew 8% on a reported basis and 7% on an organic constant currency basis, and our ES margin expanded 210 basis points. For the PEO segment, revenue increased 6% for the quarter as growth accelerated from Q3. Average worksite employees increased 3% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter to 742,000. PEO margin contracted 240 basis points, slightly more than we anticipated due to higher operating expenses and unfavorable actuarial loss development in workers' compensation reserves. For the full year, PEO revenue grew 4%. Average worksite employees increased 2% and our margin contracted 150 basis points, with the margin contraction mostly due to less favorable actuarial loss development in workers' compensation reserves versus the prior year. Our fiscal 2024 PEO new business bookings growth rate also moderated from the prior year. I'll now share outlook for fiscal 2025. While the macro backdrop remains uncertain, we believe we are well positioned to deliver solid overall financial results while continuing to invest in our future growth consistent with our strategic priorities. Our fiscal 2025 outlook assumes some moderation in economic activity over the course of the year. Beginning with the ES segment, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 6%, driven by the following key assumptions. We expect ES new business bookings growth of 4% to 7%, representing solid growth after coming in at the high end of the same guidance in fiscal 2024. For ES retention, we forecast a 10 basis point to 30 basis point decline from the 92% result for fiscal 2024. We are encouraged by our recent record client satisfaction scores, but we think it's prudent to continue to expect some retention pressure from higher small business out of business levels and slightly slower economic growth overall. As we mentioned at our prior earnings call, we see the potential for below normal US pays per control growth in fiscal 2025. And our outlook assumes 1 to 2% growth for the year. This view is consistent with most economists forecast for continued moderation in US private sector payroll growth. After price contributed around 150 basis points to ES revenue growth in both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, we anticipate a benefit closer to 100 basis points in fiscal 2025, which is in-line with the moderation in overall inflation. We also expect FX to transition from a modest tailwind to ES revenue growth in fiscal 2024 to a slight headwind in fiscal 2025. And for client funds interest revenue, the interest rate backdrop remains dynamic. And it's important to remember our client funds interest revenue forecast reflects the current forward yield curve, which is likely to continue to evolve as we move through fiscal 2025. At this point, we expect our average yield to increase from 2.9% in fiscal 2024 to 3.1% in fiscal 2025, which contemplates the market's expectations for short-term interest rates to decrease during the year. We expect our average client funds balances to grow 3% to 4% in fiscal 2025. Putting those together, we expect our client funds interest revenue to increase from $1.02 billion in fiscal 2024 to a range of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion in fiscal 2025. Meanwhile, we expect net impact from our client fund strategy to increase to a range of $1 billion to $1.02 billion in fiscal 2025. We expect ES margin to increase 100 to 120 basis points in fiscal 2025, driven by operating leverage as well as continued contribution from client funds interest revenue partially offset by ongoing investments to advance our key strategic priorities. Moving on to the PEO segment, we expect PEO revenue to grow 4% to 6% and PEO revenue excluding zero margin pass-throughs to grow 3% to 4% in fiscal 2025. Our PEO revenue growth outlook assumes average worksite employee growth of 1% to 3%. This reflects our expectation for continued new business bookings growth and modestly better retention to be offset by declining PEO pays per control growth that remains below our historical experience. We expect PEO margin to decrease 90 to 110 basis points in fiscal 2025. This anticipated margin decline reflects our forecast for zero margin pass-throughs to grow faster than PEO revenue and increase in our workers' compensation costs and higher PEO selling expense from accelerating new business bookings growth. Adding it all up, our consolidated revenue outlook is for 5% to 6% growth in fiscal 2025. And our adjusted EBIT margin outlook is for expansion of 60 to 80 basis points. We expect our effective tax rate to be around 23%. And we expect fiscal 2025 adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 10% supported by buybacks. One quick note on our margin cadence. We anticipate adjusted EBIT margin expansion on a year-over-year basis to be more modest in the first half of the year before trends ramp in the second half of fiscal 2025. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nBryan Bergin: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I want to start with bookings here. So, sounds like a pretty solid close to the year. Can you provide more color on the attribution of that bookings performance across the business? And in general, I guess when you're looking at demand into July, just any changes based on employer size or geography?\nMaria Black: Sure, good morning, Bryan. Great to hear from you. I love talking about bookings, especially on the heels of what was truly an exceptional performance by the overall team in the fourth quarter. To answer the first part of the question, it was broad-based. So we did see strength across our growth in small business, mid-market, enterprise, and international. So we are really pleased with the momentum that we see as it relates to the overall receptivity to the offerings, to the product, to the execution, and really proud of how the team moved through the quarter, which led to the exceptional results at 7% for the year. In terms of the demand environment overall and what we see, what I would offer is that the HCM demand environment remains strong. One of the things that's unique about HCM is what we do, it's not a nice to have, it is actually an imperative for a company to run their business. They need to have their associates pay, they need HR tools, and certainly it's not getting any easier. Whether you're in the down-market, mid-market, up-market, to navigate being an employer. And as such, we fit squarely into that. So we feel good about the momentum stepping out of the quarter. We feel good about the demand environment stepping into the quarter. Pipelines from a year-on-year perspective look strong. So we're very optimistic and proud of the performance.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, I appreciate that. And then my follow-up, just on kind of pays per control performance here, can you compare and contrast the pays per control performance in ES versus what you're kind of seeing on the same store sale, PPC and PEO. And any cadence assumptions here as you go through 2025?\nDon McGuire: Yeah, Bryan, I'll take that one. So as we look at pays per control, we do think that the labor market is still pretty resilient. I mean, there are a number of factors that we look to. And, you know, if you look at the BLS, you look at the unemployment rate, JOLTS Report came in the other day, it was down, but better than expected. Labor force participation still got some room to go, et cetera. So jobless claims are kind of neither here nor there. They're benign. So we think there's still continued good strength in the market. Having said that, we do think that pays per control is going to moderate. And we have said we're thinking 1% to 2%, as we go forward into 2025. I would say that we do expect that the pays per control growth in the PEO will be lower than it is in ES, but we are still optimistic that there's growth to be had, but certainly we expect ES to be somewhat stronger than we expect PEO.\nBryan Bergin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Oh, thanks guys for taking my question. You know just to touch again on ES, like I kind of want to know like how much of that strength is idiosyncratic and things that you're doing internally versus the macro. And then maybe the follow-up is again asking about the guidance and like maybe you can layout you know what could go well and what could go wrong in terms of the macro -- the underlying macro for the guide that would be it. Thank you.\nDon McGuire: Yeah Dan. So you know just to follow up on that I would say that you could will unemployment remain as low as it has been? I think there's no indication that it's going to worsen. It's still at, you know, decade lows or comparable to decade lows. There is good strength, there seems to be good strength across the broader spectrum of new jobs. So the NER report came out earlier today and we're [continuing] (ph) to see new jobs. So I think that we put out there a PPC growth number that's realistic. What could change that? We could imagine all kinds of macro issues, but I prefer not to do any imagining. I think we're trying to do what we can based on what we know today. So I think that what we have today is pretty good. But as I mentioned earlier to Bryan's question, we certainly recognize that ES is likely to be stronger than PEO.\nMaria Black: And Dan, if I can just add on the sales side, just with respect to -- are we driving the results as it being driven by Macro? My answer to you would be both. And so I think we have a strong demand environment. I touched on that during Bryan's question in terms of our offer and how squarely it fits into that demand environment. And that's really a broad-based execution across the entire business. So it is the investments we've made into our products. It is the best-in-class service that we have. We see that in the NPS results, by the way we see that in our retention results as well. And so I think we've been getting stronger and stronger. I think the value proposition of what we offer is an imperative for businesses. And then once again, I would say, yeah, we are executing incredibly well across the full spectrum of our sales differentiation. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I consider it to be one of the greatest competitive advantages that ADP has. Part of that is our ability to canvas the entire market. So whether buyers trying to buy digitally, or they're trying to buy through a channel, or they're trying to buy the traditional way, like we show up at every single turn, and we lean right into that with the best product and the best service out there. And as a result of all of those things, I think we are executing very well.\nDan Dolev: Great results, Thank you.\nMaria Black: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask on competition. Some of our recent conversations with those in the industry have kind of indicated that there's been some meaningful price compression from some of your competitors, particularly in the mid and down market segments. Have you observed others getting more competitive on price or from your perspective, is it fairly status quo right now?\nMaria Black: Good morning James. What I would offer is it is pretty status quo. We haven't really observed any of those meaningful price compression, things of that nature. Given how much we do compete, I think we would see \u2013 I\u2019d say, that there is always some of that in terms of whether it is promotions and things that all of us run at various times throughout the year. But it doesn't seem atypical for me. And obviously, I've spent a lot of years watching the competitive landscape and the sales environment. So I haven't seen anything anomalous. I think the one thing that's changed, specifically in the competitive landscape is us. And so when I think about our ability to execute, and everything I just mentioned, best product, record retention, record NPS, incredible execution by sales. I think we are stronger than we've ever been. So I'd say, that's the shift. But from our purposes, it is still a competitive environment and we lean into it every single day.\nJames Faucette: Great. Glad to hear that. And then wondering if you can give a little bit more color on the composition of bookings, especially between enterprise, mid-market and down market. And also, what are you seeing in the international business? And how should we think about the potential uplift there over time, as price points in lower-cost regions continue to improve?\nMaria Black: What I would offer is that the down market had incredible strength by the way on top of incredible strength last year. I think I mentioned -- or I did mention during the prepared remarks, we onboarded, we sold and started 50,000 new clients in small business in the fourth quarter alone. So we are officially got 890,000 of our 1.1 million clients are in that down market space. And so we continue just to see broad-based demand. And again, we\u2019re executing very well on that. Our mid-market sales results were phenomenal. Just an incredible execution by the team. Again, our product has been getting newer and stronger, so feel really good about that. I mentioned also in the prepared remarks what we saw in the enterprise space, specifically with respect to our next-gen HCM offering. One of the reasons I'm so excited about this is that we are seeing record results, we are seeing more than we anticipated, quite significantly more than we anticipated. And we are not even at general availability yet. And what that suggests to me is that the market is ready for this offering -- the market is excited about this offering. We see clients wanting to buy in the enterprise space from ADP, and we are stepping into that opportunity. So that's kind of the distribution. Very strong strength. You asked about international specifically. International had a fantastic year overall. So it was really the story of four quarters. I think first quarter of last year was strong over year-on-year first quarter of 2023. Second quarter got even stronger. Third quarter got even stronger than that. And fourth quarter, you'll probably guess got even stronger than that. So overall, our international business had just a fantastic year as well.\nJames Faucette: That\u2019s great. I appreciate all the color Maria.\nMaria Black: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wonder if you could comment on how you're thinking about the balance -- striking a balance between pricing and retention and just sort of also speak to your confidence level about being able to take that 100 basis points of pricing, which I think is more than you took sort of pre-pandemic, although less than you've been taking in this really inflationary environment. How are you -- how confident are you that you can take that without tipping retention in the wrong direction?\nDon McGuire: Thanks for the question Ramsey. Yes, it is a great question because we always think really, really hard about pricing decisions and making sure that we don't get greedy. As we've shared on many occasions, what we are interested in is long-term clients and the lifetime value of those clients. So we are always very, very careful not to over rotate on price. And you are right, we have been able to take about 150 basis points in '23 and '24. And as we look to '25 and we looked at the moderating inflation environment, we thought that 100 basis points is realistic. If we go back pre '23 and back into the teens we were more on the 50 basis points range, but the inflation environment was very, very different then it was virtually not existent. So we are confident that we can get 100 basis points. We are confident that we can target it in the right places. So it is something that we think is a reasonable expectation for us to target.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. And a follow-up for me is about generative AI. And just if you could talk about how we should think about the long-term kind of opportunity there in terms of monetization. Is this ever something that could contribute to revenue directly? Or is this -- is generative AI sort of more something that will drive soft dollars to retention, new bookings? Obviously, there is an expense benefit internally. But I'm just curious about how you're framing it up over the long term.\nMaria Black: It's a great question. My answer to you would be both. And so from a generative AI perspective, I know you know that I love to speak about it. I talked about it again at length just this morning during the prepared remarks. What I\u2019d offer is that all across, whether it is the focus we have of putting generative AI, ADP Assist across and into each one of our products, or it is the work that we're doing with putting ADP Assist into the market to help practitioners, or help our own service associates and our sales associates, the way I think about it, first and foremost is exactly what you suggested, which is it should feed the ADP model. And in its most simplistic form when I think about this company and driving the recurring revenue model that we have, it is about sales, it is about retention, it is about product efficiency and it's about NPS. And those four metrics generative AI and everything that we are offering as it relates to ADP Assist should feed, call it the machine of our model, right? So we should have more sales, we should be able to keep clients. Why? Because they are happier and they have a better experience as it relates to NPS. And then in turn, we also drive efficiency. So I think that's the output and the outcome of a lot of the investments we are making. That said, as we look at all the use cases and both the short-term stuff that we're working on, as well as the long-term vision of what ultimately generative AI could look like in the coming years, we do see monetization opportunities. And each one of our business cases, as you can imagine, has clear goals of what it is that we are trying to accomplish, inclusive of revenue growth. I think it's too early to start sharing some of those broadly across the market. But certainly, that's a big piece of our strategy, as is making sure that we continue to drive the transformation type of opportunities that we've been driving for years as a company.\nRamsey El-Assal: Fantastic, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Don, maybe one for you. Just on the PEO guidance, and I apologize if this question is kind of a dumb question, but I just want to make sure I understood it. If I look back to last year, you had actually a slightly better WSE assumption, and you guided to 3% to 5%. And this year, you are assuming lower WSE growth but actually slightly better revenue growth. And I was just trying to reconcile those two things. Is retention assumptions the big difference there? Or is there some other mechanical thing, it is easier comps? I'm just trying to understand the PEO guidance this year versus last year.\nDon McGuire: No, Samad, it is a great question. So there are a few things happening if you look forward to 2025, revenue is growing, but the biggest contributor to the revenue growth is zero margin pass-throughs. So that's the largest component, and that's what's happening there. And then, of course, we have mentioned earlier that pays per control are under pressure. So as I said in an earlier answer, 1% to 2% for ES, and we think more towards the low end of that for the PEO area. And then we have a little bit of pressure from workman's compensation on the margin. And I guess the third thing is we do continue to focus on the area to get sales reaccelerating. So we certainly have more selling expense baked in to that business to help drive the top-line and make sure we get to continue to grow our worksite employees.\nSamad Samana: Understood. And Maria, if I take just one huge step back, the business is very strong right now, and it seems like that's happening in what is a backdrop that is slowing. And so I just was wondering, you've been at ADP for a long time, you've seen multiple cycles, can you just remind us that when you see a broader slowdown in the backdrop, just kind of how you still are able to drive value and what the performance of the business has historically been in these slowdown periods, because I think we are all impressed by the durability of the strength even as things may be slow in the backdrop?\nMaria Black: Yes. Thanks, Samad. And you are right. I think the durability of what it is that we offer, I spoke to it a bit earlier in terms of the imperative of HCM, I think that durability also lends itself to a different environment should the macro change. So the sales force of ADP, if you will our offering is great in times of growth, it is great in times of steady, and it's also great as a conduit as there might be pressure in the employer environment. And so the value proposition, we have a playbook. We can adjust very, very quickly in terms of what it is that we offer and the demand environment -- as the demand environment shift. Now that said, should there be a huge decline in the macro, of course we will be impacted. One of the things that does end up getting impacted is bookings. But at the same time, from a standpoint of the self-adjustment of that value proposition, it\u2019s very durable, and it is very durable, as a result of HCM being an imperative. And so we feel good about our ability to flex. And I've seen that, to your point Samad, I've been here a long time, as a student of ADP's great distribution, and I've seen that flex over time and have all the confidence that the team would do the same. I think maybe Don could also talk about the -- how that financial model, should something shift in the market, the financial model also self-adjusts as it relates to the playbook, if you will in a different macro.\nDon McGuire: Yes, certainly. We've talked about this before. But if we go back a year or so, I think -- or maybe 18 months, the word recession was on people's lips a lot more frequently than it is today. I think the latest survey I've seen says that there is about a 28% probability of recession in the next 12 months. I'm sure that's some survey that the rest of you have read somewhere as well. So the good news is, it looks very unlikely that we are going to have a recession over the next 12 months. But certainly, as an all-weather company, what we do isn't discretionary. You have to do it. The levers we have, if sales slow commissions slow, if implementations slow, we don't need as much headcount, et cetera, et cetera. But I think, as we saw in 2008, it took a long time for ADP to find itself in a place that looked like a lot of adjustment. So we think that we can use those tools again should we need to. But I'll just finish with hopefully, that survey is correct and nobody is thinking about a recession in the next 12 months.\nSamad Samana: Great. Appreciate. Have a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Hi, good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the strong bookings in the fourth quarter as well as the really strong retention. I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into both. With regards to the strong bookings, Maria you cited on the small business side, RUN doing extremely well, getting 50,000 new clients. Can you talk a little bit about what the source of those clients are? Were those clients that were using competitive solutions? Were they brand-new business formations? How would you characterize that? Where are you seeing the strength and the takeaways from?\nMaria Black: Sure. So on the down market specifically as it relates to bookings, the bookings again are broad-based, right? So where are we getting them? We are getting them from digital inbound, we're getting them from new businesses, we are getting them through the ecosystem of our channels, so clients that are engaging with banks, CPAs. Again, we canvass the entire market. That said, some of the things that we have seen, Mark year-on-year new business formations, it is still at an elevated rate, but it is pressurized. So sorry, year-on-year, it is minus 3%, but it's still elevated compared to norm. And so as a result of that, we did see less coming this time from new business formations. Now we had a lot come from new business formation, but we also saw an increase in balance of trade, some more coming from the competition. So what I would say is mix shifted a little bit in terms of how we broadly canvass the down market. All that rolled up to this incredible result of 50,000 units in the fourth quarter. So it is broad-based, but there are tiny bit of shifts within that to answer your question specifically.\nMark Marcon: Great. And then on next-gen HCM, you also mentioned a 50% pickup there in terms of new sales. And this is before you are fully GA. Can you talk a little bit about what the source of the wins are in terms of -- are these clients that are transitioning from older ADP platforms? Or are they coming from competitors? And if it's from competitors, what sort of competitors?\nMaria Black: Sure. The answer is both and also head-to-head against competition. So some of them are ADP upgrades. We did see more new logos than we've seen before. So we are really excited about the net new wins to ADP. Some of those were wins and takeaways from enterprise competitors. Some of them were wins head-to-head against the same said enterprise competitors, which again is probably why I'm so optimistic about it, because it appears that the offer that we have is competing incredibly well in the market and clients are choosing ADP.\nMark Marcon: That's great. And then with regards to client retention, I know you are guiding prudently for a normalization. But it seems like your client satisfaction scores continue to trend up. How would you characterize the primary drivers of the improved client satisfaction? Is it the solution set? Or is it the service underlying, or a combination of both?\nMaria Black: It is a combination of both. NPS is fantastic. So NPS for the quarter as well as the full year was a record. Almost every single business is at a record NPS. So what drives NPS? It is that both, right? So it is the investments we've made into our best-in-class products. And this is years that we've been making these investments and making our products newer and more modern taking friction out, making them more self-service. All of these things that go into having best-in-class HCM technology, those investments coupled with best-in-class service, is driving the broad NPS record that we have across the business. So as such, that is a direct correlator to a record retention. And so we are really proud of the 92%. You are right. We're prudently guiding into the year again. And the reason behind that is, as you know we've had this conversation many times, is that there is still perhaps some normalization that could happen, and also because we are executing at all-time highs almost across every single business. We just want to be thoughtful as we step into the year to make sure that the retention guide is prudent.\nMark Marcon: Got it. Thank you.\nMaria Black : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi. Perfect. Just want to extend on the retention, but more on the outlook side, if that's okay. Just any callouts expectation-wise across the segments, small, mid and large? I know you've commented on balance of trade already, but I didn't know if you are seeing anything different in terms of expectations on retention.\nMaria Black: Yes, fair. What I would offer is it is the same reason that we guided into the year, this year the way that we did, this year that we just closed, it is expected potential normalization in the down market. Now I've been saying that for the last couple of years. It isn't -- yes I know. The down market isn't entirely normalized back to where it was pre-pandemic. Now I get that that's five years ago and it may be at some point, we all have to just suggest that it is the new normal. But we haven't seen an uptick in bankruptcies, out of business at the levels that we used to see in that business. And as such, we believe it is prudent that there could still be some of that normalization. So it's really the same thing that we've been suggesting. It just hasn't happened yet. And our goal would be of course, to not have it happen again.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes. And you did outperform, obviously the guidance you set last year this time, so okay. No, I just wanted to check. I think this -- again, you've said prudent and totally agree with that. Just my quick follow-up just is on the margin front. I know it is very typical margin expansion. I think you did call it last quarter, maybe a little bit more investment in G&A. Anything different in terms of incremental margin outlook for fiscal 2025? It does look like you have a workforce rebalancing in the fourth quarter as well. So I just want to make sure we call it the puts and takes there on the margin front. Thank you.\nDon McGuire: Yes. So Tien-Tsin, thanks for the question. I think that we are always -- I'll start with where you ended there. We are always looking at the workforce and making sure we're -- we've got the right people in the right places and the right numbers of people in the right places. So we're always looking at that. I don't think there is any real specific callouts on the margin. I think that there are some Gen AI investments. These are modest, but they do attract 10, 20 bps here and there, so to speak. But they are modest all things considered. Certainly, the margin next year would get a little bit of pressure from lower pays per control from lower pricing increases and from lower client fund interest, specifically -- most specifically in the back half. But I think those are all things that we've called out and you can read through. So nothing abnormal.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes. No, glad to see it's typical. And congrats to Danny and Matt as well. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi guys. Congrats on the quarter really strong in ES. On PEO, the bookings were accelerating and recovering in fiscal year '24 but moderated towards the end of the fiscal year. So just want to understand what changed in the marketplace there.\nMaria Black: Sure. Thank you by the way. I appreciate the congrats. PEO bookings did moderate a bit in the back half. And from a year-on-year perspective, it did moderate as well. That said there was still strong growth in PEO bookings. And so from my vantage point, the demand equation is still incredibly strong for the PEO. It was a slight moderation year-on-year. We feel really solid about the demand for the offer, the value proposition of the offer, and we feel solid about pipelines in the PEO. And as you know, with pipelines in the PEO, it is more about activity in the market, new appointments, requests for proposals, things of that nature. So all the bellwether signals show that the PEO strength is still there, but it did moderate a bit in the back half.\nBryan Keane: Yes. And just a follow-up just with thinking what would it take to get PEO back to high single-digit or double-digit revenue growth that was targeted previously?\nDon McGuire: Yes. Hi Bryan, I think it's going to take a little bit of time. And we were working, and as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing some more margin pressure in PEO, and some of that is because of the investments we are making in the sales force to make sure we can get those bookings going. But realistically, to get to kind of Investor Day guidance that we provided three years ago, it is going to take some time to build that back. So we are definitely focused on that, and we are definitely focused on getting there. Of course, if we were to see some reacceleration in the pays per control, that would put lots of wind in the sails, but it's going to take a little bit of time to get back to where we want to be.\nBryan Keane: No, that makes sense. And congrats again.\nMaria Black : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Wurtzel: Good morning guys. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to go back to the margin guidance and just the context of seems like slower expansion in the first half versus second half. Wondering if you could maybe walk us through the drivers there. Is that more on the shape of revenue, or does it have anything to do on the cost side? Thank you.\nDon McGuire: No. Good question, Scott. More on the shape of expenses. Revenue expectations throughout the year are pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter. It is really some spending patterns we have in the first half of the year, but really nothing specific to call out. Just want to give folks a heads up that we think we are going to be stronger in the back half than the first.\nScott Wurtzel: Got it. That makes sense. And just as a follow-up on the international side. I mean it seems like you're making some good traction on incremental countries and geographies. And we'd love to just kind of hear about your sort of expectations for international heading into this year, how much of it is a priority for you relative to maybe other investments in the business and where you're maybe seeing opportunities internationally.\nMaria Black: Yes, fair, Scott. It is a very large priority for us. As you may remember, our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients with our global scale. International fits squarely into that strategic priority. We've been building this business for 50-some odd years. We are well ahead of the competition, as it relates to the number of countries that we serve on behalf of our clients, and moreover the infrastructure in those countries that we've built out. So we often speak to the final mile and all the things that we do to ensure that our clients have the ability to pay across very complex, sometimes large complex clients or countries, and sometimes very small complex countries. But certainly, it is a big piece of our offer. I think companies continue to want to think about their system of record from a global perspective, as they continue to have distributed workforces across the globe, as they continue to move supply chains in this world of globalization, as they have remote employees in smaller countries and around the world. We have this incredible network and ability to support clients today in what is 141 countries, and we continue to add more, as they become prudent in terms of the -- again, if it is the growth economies or where our clients are heading. But it is a big piece of our growth story. It's a big piece of our differentiation in the marketplace. And our multi-country MNC business is a clear competitive advantage for us in the international space.\nScott Wurtzel: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nCaroline Latta: Hi. This is Caroline on for Jason. Thanks for taking our question. Can you talk about the duration of the portfolio? We were a little surprised to see that the F\u201925 average yield is expected to be up year-over-year based on the number of rate cuts being forecast. And maybe how you might be adjusting your investment strategy for the portfolio based on the interest rate outlook for the next 12 months.\nDon McGuire: Caroline, thanks for the question. So we do have a laddered strategy. So if you actually refer to the -- I think, the last page of the earnings release, I think you can see the maturity schedule for our investments. And you can see that, for example in 2025, we have $6 billion that's maturing at roughly 2.2%, and our reinvestment at this point in time is 4.2%. So there's still lots of opportunity, and this is a place where ADP's laddering strategy shows its strength. It is fair to say that over the last couple of years, because of the inverted yield curve, we did have some opportunity cost by having this strategy. But I think we are very much seeing that as yield curves start to normalize, that we still have lots of opportunity for client funds interest growth. I\u2019d just add to that that the portfolio is continuing to grow. It's growing 3% to 4% again next year, maybe not as much as it has in the past couple of years because wages have moderated a little bit, pays per control moderated a little bit. But we are still seeing good growth in that area. So we still have lots of opportunity. And the most important thing here, the most important comment I can make on this whole fund strategy, is that we base all of these commitments or all of these expectations on the current yield curve. We're not trying to outguess the market. We're looking at what the market in general has to say. And we are using those yield curves to put together our forecasts and our guidance on interest rates.\nCaroline Latta : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDavid Paige: Hi. This is David Paige on for Ashish. Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to circle back to the workforce optimization charge that we had in the quarter of $42 million. Should we expect further workforce optimization in 2025? And if yes, how much of that there, what's the benefit to the EPS guidance for '25 as well? Thank you.\nDon McGuire: David, as Maria has shared earlier, I mean, we're always looking to make sure that we've got the workforce at the size it needs to be and in the places it needs to be. So we made those difficult decisions that we had to make on behalf of some of those employees. But we always look at this. And if you look at ADP over the years, we've always done what needed to be done to go forward. So I would just leave it at that and say that we're very happy with the guidance we put out here and the margin guidance as well. So we will make sure that we do what we need to do to execute, and we'll see what the future brings. But as we sit here today, we've done what we need to do, and we are looking forward to the future.\nDavid Paige: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKartik Mehta: Good morning. I know you've talked about the strength in bookings quite a bit. And I'm just wondering from an enterprise sales standpoint if there is been any change. Is the sales cycle lengthening at all? Are enterprises maybe asking to buy less modules they have in the past? Any kind of change or has it been pretty much status quo and really no change from a demand or a sales cycle standpoint?\nMaria Black: Fair. It is a great question. I think we talked about it a bit last quarter and perhaps throughout the year, which is that we're really at a new normal, as it relates to the overall sales cycles. It is reminiscent of what it used to look like pre-pandemic. But arguably, there are more decision-makers involved. The process has elongated a bit from where it was during the height of the pandemic. But the deals are moving through the motions. I would say that they are moving through the motions pretty typically. But certainly, it's not as fast as it was at one point in time. But we're not seeing less modules. We are seeing a big conversation around global, a big conversation around global system of record, things of that nature, which again is where this next-gen HCM fits squarely into that demand. So the conversation shifted a bit, but that is not necessarily new news, Kartik. It's really what we've seen over the last couple of years, as a byproduct of how clients in that enterprise global space operate. So certainly, that's how we are leading what that best offer kind of across the enterprise and international space. But from a deal cycle standpoint, it is pretty similar to what we've seen throughout this year, which is more decision-makers involved and prudency, as it relates to the decisions that are being made, but not necessarily less modules or anything of that nature.\nKartik Mehta: And then just on the small business side, I mean as you look at the health of the small business, anything that is changing or anything that would give you concern just as people get worried about the economy, or change in behavior?\nMaria Black: Yes. Great question. So we monitor so many of these things, right? So I spoke to one of them earlier, which is the pace of new business formation. That tends to be a bit bellwether. Again, it is still elevated from norms, but it is down year-on-year. We are also monitoring our own out of business. We are looking at clients that call it suspend payroll and how many are sitting in that type of capacity. These are all things and metrics that we've monitored for years to ensure that we are kind of seeing what is happening real time, if you will. What I would say is there are little pockets, very similar to the new business formation of kind of watch items that we have our eye on. None of it at this juncture gives us great pause. Quite the opposite. But at the same time, we are monitoring these things to make sure that we don't get surprised as it relates to the shift should there be one. But there hasn't been one yet.\nKartik Mehta: Perfect. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Maria Black for any closing remarks.\nMaria Black: Great. Thank you. So I will end where I started, which is I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our 64,000 associates. All of the results that Don and I have the pleasure of getting on this call to represent, they are a byproduct of 64,000 associates that are all incredibly committed to having the best-in-class technology, the best service, and the biggest, broadest global scale. And everything we do, whether it is from product innovation to our contracting process, to our sellers, to our service associates, it really takes the entire company being aligned on what I would suggest is a commitment to client and client centricity. In that spirit, I'd also like just to take a minute to thank our 1.1 million clients. I will tell you, as we celebrated the 75th anniversary of ADP, it was quite a remarkable moment to think about all the clients that we've impacted over 75 years and had the honor of contributing to their journeys of success and navigation. So definitely want to take a minute to honor all of our clients. And then last but not least, all of you who dialed-in today. I appreciate you joining us. I appreciate your interest and your investment in ADP. And I look forward to speaking with you soon.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

            "name": "Maria Black",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt and good morning. Before we get started, I'd like to take a minute to thank Danyal Hussain for leading Investor Relations for these past several years. He helped lead us through the pandemic and helped Shepherd our CFO and CEO transitions during his time. With Danny moving on to a broader role, it is my pleasure to officially welcome Matt Keating to his first call. Congratulations to you both. We closed out the year with a strong fourth quarter that included 6% revenue growth, 80 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion and 11% adjusted EPS growth. For fiscal 2024, we delivered 7% revenue growth, 70 basis points of adjusted EBIT margin expansion, and 12% adjusted EPS growth, representing another great year for ADP. I'm excited to share the progress we've made across our three strategic priorities, but first I'll start off with some additional highlights from our results. Our sales and marketing team delivered exceptional employer services, new business bookings in Q4, on top of a strong Q4 last year. This performance was broad based, showing continued strength in our small business portfolio, as well as our mid-market enterprise and international businesses. In fact, we sold and started more than 50,000 new small business clients during the quarter, which not only reflects the strength of our run solution, but also our reputation for commitment to strong service. Similarly, in the enterprise space, client interest in our next-gen HCM solution has exceeded expectations and resulted in strong Q4 sales, and we are excited to continue this great momentum. As a result of this exceptional performance, our fiscal 2024 employer services bookings growth came in at 7%, the high end of our 4% to 7% guidance range. This growth speaks to the power of ADP's unmatched distribution model, which remains a clear competitive advantage for us. With our new business pipeline even stronger than this time last year, we look forward to building on that momentum. Overall, our employer services retention came in better than expected for the year at 92%. We drove record level retention in our mid-market business for the second consecutive year in fiscal 2024. I'm also extremely proud to share that our client satisfaction scores for our total business reached new all-time highs for both the fourth quarter and full year. These results are a testament to the strength of our entire product portfolio and our commitment to supporting our clients. We are confident that these client satisfaction gains will support our retention results moving forward. Our employer services pays per control increased 2% both for the quarter and the full year. We were happy to have seen the resilience of the US Labor market, as our clients continued to hire employees at a moderate pace. Finally, our fourth quarter PEO revenue growth of 6% exceeded our expectations despite continued pressure from slowing client hiring activity. Our fiscal 2024 accomplishments extend far beyond our strong financial results. One year ago, I laid the foundation for our three strategic priorities that will guide our future growth. Now, I'd like to recap some of the great progress we made in each of these areas. Our first priority is to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. We had a very busy year on this front as we launched ADP Assist, our cross-platform solution powered by generative AI that transforms client data into actionable insights. This isn't just another technical solution, it's an experience that combines ADP's deep data set and expertise to empower HR professionals, leaders, and employees. We deployed ADP Assist across several of our platforms, including [Roll] (ph), RUN, Workforce Now, and next-gen HCM, with enhanced capabilities ranging from report creation to natural language search to initiating HR actions. These tools streamline daily tasks and are all powered by an easy-to-use search interface that is already receiving meaningful recognition in the field of generative AI. We are very proud to share that ADP Assist earned the Generative AI Innovation Award in the 2024 AI Breakthrough Awards, and we look forward to rolling out even more features in fiscal 2025. In addition to embedding generative AI in our products, we continued to advance our next-gen initiatives. Our active next-gen payroll client count increased by nearly 50% in fiscal 2024, and we grew our number of live next-gen HCM clients by more than 30% as we continued to improve implementation times. Our next priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing. Our approach to supporting our clients has been key to our winning formula for decades. And in fiscal 2024, we focused our efforts on implementing new technology that will help make an even greater impact for our clients. To further unlock the value of our expertise, we deployed generative AI tools like call summarization and real-time guidance to support our service associates. We also invested in generative AI and other automation capabilities for our implementation teams to reduce manual data entry and minimize the risk of error during implementation. For example, out of the 50,000 new RUN clients we sold and started during the fourth quarter, about half were digitally onboarded compared to a third of our new client onboarding and run this time last year. And as generative AI capabilities advance, we are excited to further accelerate this progress. Finally, we plan to provide additional tools to help our associates deliver better, faster service and allow our client satisfaction scores to continue reaching new record levels. Our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients with our global scale. Globally, we bring together an unmatched footprint, best-in-class integrated solutions, and industry-leading service and expertise to help our clients and their employees navigate the changing world of work. In fiscal 2024, we continued to leverage this global scale to strengthen our business. We extended our global footprint, acquiring the payroll business of our partner in Sweden, expanding the scope of our Celergo payroll offering to include Iceland, and further growing our on-the-ground presence in the APAC region. Our iHCM platform also continued to scale in several European countries and now serves more than 5,000 clients and pays more than 1 million client employees. Finally, we deepened our existing partnerships with several other leading technology providers to further simplify HCM processes and broaden the spectrum of support we can provide our clients. Next, I'd like to share some new client wins from Q4 to highlight how we're leading in workforce innovation and delivering value for our clients. In US Small business, we continue to successfully onboard new retirement services clients across multiple industry verticals. During the quarter, we added the plan of a Texas-based insurance agency, which was challenged by manual processes and the management of multiple providers. ADP's advanced technology and planned [fiduciary] (ph) solutions simplified the client's plan administration, reduced its manual oversight, and lowered its plan fees. The ADP team made the transition easy and stress-free by providing the client with critical management of the transfer process, as well as regular briefings on the plan set up. This is just one of the thousands of new clients who turn to our retirement services solution every year. In fact, we recently took the top spot as the nation's largest 401(k) record keeper by Total Plans and Total 401(k) Plans in the Plan Sponsor Magazine 2024 defined contribution Record Keeping Survey. We serve over 170,000 retirement services clients and it brings me great joy to see how ADP is helping employers address the retirement savings needs of so many Americans. We look forward to continuing the momentum in our retirement services business in fiscal 2025. In our HR outsourcing business, an orthopedic device company who had grown extensively through acquisition recognized it needed a deeper HR and technology infrastructure to support its future growth. So it turned to our comprehensive services support model to integrate its acquired companies onto a common platform. We look forward to supporting this client's current needs and helping it expand in the future. Additionally, comprehensive services cost a major milestone in fiscal 2024, generating more than $1 billion in revenue for the year. This business has come a long way since its launch in 2008, and we look forward to leaning into our outsourcing business as a differentiator. In US Enterprise, we welcomed one of the largest automotive dealers in the Midwest to our next-gen HCM platform. Following several years of rapid growth, this client wanted to reimagine their HCM strategy. To help, our team went on-site and conducted a deep review of its current practices and pain points. We developed a plan that would leverage our next-gen HCM platform, flexible position management structure and other advanced HCM tools to address the organization's current and future HR strategy. Our initial solution included HR, payroll, time, and benefits, and the client later added recruiting and talent management. We look forward to helping shape the future of their workforce together. Overall, we were extremely pleased with our strong financial and strategic outcomes this past year. In fiscal 2024, ADP was recognized as the world's most admired company by Fortune magazine for the 18th consecutive year, and we also celebrated our 30th straight year on the Fortune 500. As some of you may know, 2024 is also our 75th anniversary. As I reflect on ADP's enduring impact on the world of work, the one constant on our journey is our talented associates, be it the recent accolades we received or the 75 years of support for our clients, we owe our recognition and strong financial performance to our 64,000 dedicated associates who deliver the great products and exceptional experiences and continue to drive our client satisfaction scores to new highs. I want to take a moment to recognize them for their incredible contributions. Thank you for all you do for ADP and for our clients. And now I'll turn the call over to Don. Sure, good morning, Bryan. Great to hear from you. I love talking about bookings, especially on the heels of what was truly an exceptional performance by the overall team in the fourth quarter. To answer the first part of the question, it was broad-based. So we did see strength across our growth in small business, mid-market, enterprise, and international. So we are really pleased with the momentum that we see as it relates to the overall receptivity to the offerings, to the product, to the execution, and really proud of how the team moved through the quarter, which led to the exceptional results at 7% for the year. In terms of the demand environment overall and what we see, what I would offer is that the HCM demand environment remains strong. One of the things that's unique about HCM is what we do, it's not a nice to have, it is actually an imperative for a company to run their business. They need to have their associates pay, they need HR tools, and certainly it's not getting any easier. Whether you're in the down-market, mid-market, up-market, to navigate being an employer. And as such, we fit squarely into that. So we feel good about the momentum stepping out of the quarter. We feel good about the demand environment stepping into the quarter. Pipelines from a year-on-year perspective look strong. So we're very optimistic and proud of the performance. And Dan, if I can just add on the sales side, just with respect to -- are we driving the results as it being driven by Macro? My answer to you would be both. And so I think we have a strong demand environment. I touched on that during Bryan's question in terms of our offer and how squarely it fits into that demand environment. And that's really a broad-based execution across the entire business. So it is the investments we've made into our products. It is the best-in-class service that we have. We see that in the NPS results, by the way we see that in our retention results as well. And so I think we've been getting stronger and stronger. I think the value proposition of what we offer is an imperative for businesses. And then once again, I would say, yeah, we are executing incredibly well across the full spectrum of our sales differentiation. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, I consider it to be one of the greatest competitive advantages that ADP has. Part of that is our ability to canvas the entire market. So whether buyers trying to buy digitally, or they're trying to buy through a channel, or they're trying to buy the traditional way, like we show up at every single turn, and we lean right into that with the best product and the best service out there. And as a result of all of those things, I think we are executing very well. Thank you. Good morning James. What I would offer is it is pretty status quo. We haven't really observed any of those meaningful price compression, things of that nature. Given how much we do compete, I think we would see \u2013 I\u2019d say, that there is always some of that in terms of whether it is promotions and things that all of us run at various times throughout the year. But it doesn't seem atypical for me. And obviously, I've spent a lot of years watching the competitive landscape and the sales environment. So I haven't seen anything anomalous. I think the one thing that's changed, specifically in the competitive landscape is us. And so when I think about our ability to execute, and everything I just mentioned, best product, record retention, record NPS, incredible execution by sales. I think we are stronger than we've ever been. So I'd say, that's the shift. But from our purposes, it is still a competitive environment and we lean into it every single day. What I would offer is that the down market had incredible strength by the way on top of incredible strength last year. I think I mentioned -- or I did mention during the prepared remarks, we onboarded, we sold and started 50,000 new clients in small business in the fourth quarter alone. So we are officially got 890,000 of our 1.1 million clients are in that down market space. And so we continue just to see broad-based demand. And again, we\u2019re executing very well on that. Our mid-market sales results were phenomenal. Just an incredible execution by the team. Again, our product has been getting newer and stronger, so feel really good about that. I mentioned also in the prepared remarks what we saw in the enterprise space, specifically with respect to our next-gen HCM offering. One of the reasons I'm so excited about this is that we are seeing record results, we are seeing more than we anticipated, quite significantly more than we anticipated. And we are not even at general availability yet. And what that suggests to me is that the market is ready for this offering -- the market is excited about this offering. We see clients wanting to buy in the enterprise space from ADP, and we are stepping into that opportunity. So that's kind of the distribution. Very strong strength. You asked about international specifically. International had a fantastic year overall. So it was really the story of four quarters. I think first quarter of last year was strong over year-on-year first quarter of 2023. Second quarter got even stronger. Third quarter got even stronger than that. And fourth quarter, you'll probably guess got even stronger than that. So overall, our international business had just a fantastic year as well. Thanks. It's a great question. My answer to you would be both. And so from a generative AI perspective, I know you know that I love to speak about it. I talked about it again at length just this morning during the prepared remarks. What I\u2019d offer is that all across, whether it is the focus we have of putting generative AI, ADP Assist across and into each one of our products, or it is the work that we're doing with putting ADP Assist into the market to help practitioners, or help our own service associates and our sales associates, the way I think about it, first and foremost is exactly what you suggested, which is it should feed the ADP model. And in its most simplistic form when I think about this company and driving the recurring revenue model that we have, it is about sales, it is about retention, it is about product efficiency and it's about NPS. And those four metrics generative AI and everything that we are offering as it relates to ADP Assist should feed, call it the machine of our model, right? So we should have more sales, we should be able to keep clients. Why? Because they are happier and they have a better experience as it relates to NPS. And then in turn, we also drive efficiency. So I think that's the output and the outcome of a lot of the investments we are making. That said, as we look at all the use cases and both the short-term stuff that we're working on, as well as the long-term vision of what ultimately generative AI could look like in the coming years, we do see monetization opportunities. And each one of our business cases, as you can imagine, has clear goals of what it is that we are trying to accomplish, inclusive of revenue growth. I think it's too early to start sharing some of those broadly across the market. But certainly, that's a big piece of our strategy, as is making sure that we continue to drive the transformation type of opportunities that we've been driving for years as a company. Yes. Thanks, Samad. And you are right. I think the durability of what it is that we offer, I spoke to it a bit earlier in terms of the imperative of HCM, I think that durability also lends itself to a different environment should the macro change. So the sales force of ADP, if you will our offering is great in times of growth, it is great in times of steady, and it's also great as a conduit as there might be pressure in the employer environment. And so the value proposition, we have a playbook. We can adjust very, very quickly in terms of what it is that we offer and the demand environment -- as the demand environment shift. Now that said, should there be a huge decline in the macro, of course we will be impacted. One of the things that does end up getting impacted is bookings. But at the same time, from a standpoint of the self-adjustment of that value proposition, it\u2019s very durable, and it is very durable, as a result of HCM being an imperative. And so we feel good about our ability to flex. And I've seen that, to your point Samad, I've been here a long time, as a student of ADP's great distribution, and I've seen that flex over time and have all the confidence that the team would do the same. I think maybe Don could also talk about the -- how that financial model, should something shift in the market, the financial model also self-adjusts as it relates to the playbook, if you will in a different macro. Sure. So on the down market specifically as it relates to bookings, the bookings again are broad-based, right? So where are we getting them? We are getting them from digital inbound, we're getting them from new businesses, we are getting them through the ecosystem of our channels, so clients that are engaging with banks, CPAs. Again, we canvass the entire market. That said, some of the things that we have seen, Mark year-on-year new business formations, it is still at an elevated rate, but it is pressurized. So sorry, year-on-year, it is minus 3%, but it's still elevated compared to norm. And so as a result of that, we did see less coming this time from new business formations. Now we had a lot come from new business formation, but we also saw an increase in balance of trade, some more coming from the competition. So what I would say is mix shifted a little bit in terms of how we broadly canvass the down market. All that rolled up to this incredible result of 50,000 units in the fourth quarter. So it is broad-based, but there are tiny bit of shifts within that to answer your question specifically. Sure. The answer is both and also head-to-head against competition. So some of them are ADP upgrades. We did see more new logos than we've seen before. So we are really excited about the net new wins to ADP. Some of those were wins and takeaways from enterprise competitors. Some of them were wins head-to-head against the same said enterprise competitors, which again is probably why I'm so optimistic about it, because it appears that the offer that we have is competing incredibly well in the market and clients are choosing ADP. It is a combination of both. NPS is fantastic. So NPS for the quarter as well as the full year was a record. Almost every single business is at a record NPS. So what drives NPS? It is that both, right? So it is the investments we've made into our best-in-class products. And this is years that we've been making these investments and making our products newer and more modern taking friction out, making them more self-service. All of these things that go into having best-in-class HCM technology, those investments coupled with best-in-class service, is driving the broad NPS record that we have across the business. So as such, that is a direct correlator to a record retention. And so we are really proud of the 92%. You are right. We're prudently guiding into the year again. And the reason behind that is, as you know we've had this conversation many times, is that there is still perhaps some normalization that could happen, and also because we are executing at all-time highs almost across every single business. We just want to be thoughtful as we step into the year to make sure that the retention guide is prudent. Thank you. Yes, fair. What I would offer is it is the same reason that we guided into the year, this year the way that we did, this year that we just closed, it is expected potential normalization in the down market. Now I've been saying that for the last couple of years. It isn't -- yes I know. The down market isn't entirely normalized back to where it was pre-pandemic. Now I get that that's five years ago and it may be at some point, we all have to just suggest that it is the new normal. But we haven't seen an uptick in bankruptcies, out of business at the levels that we used to see in that business. And as such, we believe it is prudent that there could still be some of that normalization. So it's really the same thing that we've been suggesting. It just hasn't happened yet. And our goal would be of course, to not have it happen again. Sure. Thank you by the way. I appreciate the congrats. PEO bookings did moderate a bit in the back half. And from a year-on-year perspective, it did moderate as well. That said there was still strong growth in PEO bookings. And so from my vantage point, the demand equation is still incredibly strong for the PEO. It was a slight moderation year-on-year. We feel really solid about the demand for the offer, the value proposition of the offer, and we feel solid about pipelines in the PEO. And as you know, with pipelines in the PEO, it is more about activity in the market, new appointments, requests for proposals, things of that nature. So all the bellwether signals show that the PEO strength is still there, but it did moderate a bit in the back half. Thank you. Yes, fair, Scott. It is a very large priority for us. As you may remember, our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients with our global scale. International fits squarely into that strategic priority. We've been building this business for 50-some odd years. We are well ahead of the competition, as it relates to the number of countries that we serve on behalf of our clients, and moreover the infrastructure in those countries that we've built out. So we often speak to the final mile and all the things that we do to ensure that our clients have the ability to pay across very complex, sometimes large complex clients or countries, and sometimes very small complex countries. But certainly, it is a big piece of our offer. I think companies continue to want to think about their system of record from a global perspective, as they continue to have distributed workforces across the globe, as they continue to move supply chains in this world of globalization, as they have remote employees in smaller countries and around the world. We have this incredible network and ability to support clients today in what is 141 countries, and we continue to add more, as they become prudent in terms of the -- again, if it is the growth economies or where our clients are heading. But it is a big piece of our growth story. It's a big piece of our differentiation in the marketplace. And our multi-country MNC business is a clear competitive advantage for us in the international space. Fair. It is a great question. I think we talked about it a bit last quarter and perhaps throughout the year, which is that we're really at a new normal, as it relates to the overall sales cycles. It is reminiscent of what it used to look like pre-pandemic. But arguably, there are more decision-makers involved. The process has elongated a bit from where it was during the height of the pandemic. But the deals are moving through the motions. I would say that they are moving through the motions pretty typically. But certainly, it's not as fast as it was at one point in time. But we're not seeing less modules. We are seeing a big conversation around global, a big conversation around global system of record, things of that nature, which again is where this next-gen HCM fits squarely into that demand. So the conversation shifted a bit, but that is not necessarily new news, Kartik. It's really what we've seen over the last couple of years, as a byproduct of how clients in that enterprise global space operate. So certainly, that's how we are leading what that best offer kind of across the enterprise and international space. But from a deal cycle standpoint, it is pretty similar to what we've seen throughout this year, which is more decision-makers involved and prudency, as it relates to the decisions that are being made, but not necessarily less modules or anything of that nature. Yes. Great question. So we monitor so many of these things, right? So I spoke to one of them earlier, which is the pace of new business formation. That tends to be a bit bellwether. Again, it is still elevated from norms, but it is down year-on-year. We are also monitoring our own out of business. We are looking at clients that call it suspend payroll and how many are sitting in that type of capacity. These are all things and metrics that we've monitored for years to ensure that we are kind of seeing what is happening real time, if you will. What I would say is there are little pockets, very similar to the new business formation of kind of watch items that we have our eye on. None of it at this juncture gives us great pause. Quite the opposite. But at the same time, we are monitoring these things to make sure that we don't get surprised as it relates to the shift should there be one. But there hasn't been one yet. Great. Thank you. So I will end where I started, which is I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our 64,000 associates. All of the results that Don and I have the pleasure of getting on this call to represent, they are a byproduct of 64,000 associates that are all incredibly committed to having the best-in-class technology, the best service, and the biggest, broadest global scale. And everything we do, whether it is from product innovation to our contracting process, to our sellers, to our service associates, it really takes the entire company being aligned on what I would suggest is a commitment to client and client centricity. In that spirit, I'd also like just to take a minute to thank our 1.1 million clients. I will tell you, as we celebrated the 75th anniversary of ADP, it was quite a remarkable moment to think about all the clients that we've impacted over 75 years and had the honor of contributing to their journeys of success and navigation. So definitely want to take a minute to honor all of our clients. And then last but not least, all of you who dialed-in today. I appreciate you joining us. I appreciate your interest and your investment in ADP. And I look forward to speaking with you soon."

            "name": "Don McGuire",
            "content": "Thank you, Maria. And good morning, everyone. I'll start by expanding on Maria's comments around our Q4 results and then cover our fiscal 2025 financial outlook. Q4 performance was very strong overall, helping to drive fiscal 2024 revenue and earnings growth towards the high end of our expectations. As previously mentioned, we benefited from broad-based strengths in employer services with exceptional new business bookings, better than anticipated retention, and stable pays per control growth. PEO revenue growth in the quarter also came in better than expected. Our strong Q4 results contributed to our full year revenue growth of 7%, bringing our fiscal 2024 revenue to $19.2 billion. For our employer services segment, revenue in the quarter increased 7% on both a reported and organic constant currency basis. These results were bolstered by a slightly better than expected contribution from client funds interest. Our ES margin expanded 220 basis points in the fourth quarter, which exceeded our expectation. For the full year, our ES revenue grew 8% on a reported basis and 7% on an organic constant currency basis, and our ES margin expanded 210 basis points. For the PEO segment, revenue increased 6% for the quarter as growth accelerated from Q3. Average worksite employees increased 3% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter to 742,000. PEO margin contracted 240 basis points, slightly more than we anticipated due to higher operating expenses and unfavorable actuarial loss development in workers' compensation reserves. For the full year, PEO revenue grew 4%. Average worksite employees increased 2% and our margin contracted 150 basis points, with the margin contraction mostly due to less favorable actuarial loss development in workers' compensation reserves versus the prior year. Our fiscal 2024 PEO new business bookings growth rate also moderated from the prior year. I'll now share outlook for fiscal 2025. While the macro backdrop remains uncertain, we believe we are well positioned to deliver solid overall financial results while continuing to invest in our future growth consistent with our strategic priorities. Our fiscal 2025 outlook assumes some moderation in economic activity over the course of the year. Beginning with the ES segment, we expect revenue growth of 5% to 6%, driven by the following key assumptions. We expect ES new business bookings growth of 4% to 7%, representing solid growth after coming in at the high end of the same guidance in fiscal 2024. For ES retention, we forecast a 10 basis point to 30 basis point decline from the 92% result for fiscal 2024. We are encouraged by our recent record client satisfaction scores, but we think it's prudent to continue to expect some retention pressure from higher small business out of business levels and slightly slower economic growth overall. As we mentioned at our prior earnings call, we see the potential for below normal US pays per control growth in fiscal 2025. And our outlook assumes 1 to 2% growth for the year. This view is consistent with most economists forecast for continued moderation in US private sector payroll growth. After price contributed around 150 basis points to ES revenue growth in both fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, we anticipate a benefit closer to 100 basis points in fiscal 2025, which is in-line with the moderation in overall inflation. We also expect FX to transition from a modest tailwind to ES revenue growth in fiscal 2024 to a slight headwind in fiscal 2025. And for client funds interest revenue, the interest rate backdrop remains dynamic. And it's important to remember our client funds interest revenue forecast reflects the current forward yield curve, which is likely to continue to evolve as we move through fiscal 2025. At this point, we expect our average yield to increase from 2.9% in fiscal 2024 to 3.1% in fiscal 2025, which contemplates the market's expectations for short-term interest rates to decrease during the year. We expect our average client funds balances to grow 3% to 4% in fiscal 2025. Putting those together, we expect our client funds interest revenue to increase from $1.02 billion in fiscal 2024 to a range of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion in fiscal 2025. Meanwhile, we expect net impact from our client fund strategy to increase to a range of $1 billion to $1.02 billion in fiscal 2025. We expect ES margin to increase 100 to 120 basis points in fiscal 2025, driven by operating leverage as well as continued contribution from client funds interest revenue partially offset by ongoing investments to advance our key strategic priorities. Moving on to the PEO segment, we expect PEO revenue to grow 4% to 6% and PEO revenue excluding zero margin pass-throughs to grow 3% to 4% in fiscal 2025. Our PEO revenue growth outlook assumes average worksite employee growth of 1% to 3%. This reflects our expectation for continued new business bookings growth and modestly better retention to be offset by declining PEO pays per control growth that remains below our historical experience. We expect PEO margin to decrease 90 to 110 basis points in fiscal 2025. This anticipated margin decline reflects our forecast for zero margin pass-throughs to grow faster than PEO revenue and increase in our workers' compensation costs and higher PEO selling expense from accelerating new business bookings growth. Adding it all up, our consolidated revenue outlook is for 5% to 6% growth in fiscal 2025. And our adjusted EBIT margin outlook is for expansion of 60 to 80 basis points. We expect our effective tax rate to be around 23%. And we expect fiscal 2025 adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 10% supported by buybacks. One quick note on our margin cadence. We anticipate adjusted EBIT margin expansion on a year-over-year basis to be more modest in the first half of the year before trends ramp in the second half of fiscal 2025. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A. Yeah, Bryan, I'll take that one. So as we look at pays per control, we do think that the labor market is still pretty resilient. I mean, there are a number of factors that we look to. And, you know, if you look at the BLS, you look at the unemployment rate, JOLTS Report came in the other day, it was down, but better than expected. Labor force participation still got some room to go, et cetera. So jobless claims are kind of neither here nor there. They're benign. So we think there's still continued good strength in the market. Having said that, we do think that pays per control is going to moderate. And we have said we're thinking 1% to 2%, as we go forward into 2025. I would say that we do expect that the pays per control growth in the PEO will be lower than it is in ES, but we are still optimistic that there's growth to be had, but certainly we expect ES to be somewhat stronger than we expect PEO. Yeah Dan. So you know just to follow up on that I would say that you could will unemployment remain as low as it has been? I think there's no indication that it's going to worsen. It's still at, you know, decade lows or comparable to decade lows. There is good strength, there seems to be good strength across the broader spectrum of new jobs. So the NER report came out earlier today and we're [continuing] (ph) to see new jobs. So I think that we put out there a PPC growth number that's realistic. What could change that? We could imagine all kinds of macro issues, but I prefer not to do any imagining. I think we're trying to do what we can based on what we know today. So I think that what we have today is pretty good. But as I mentioned earlier to Bryan's question, we certainly recognize that ES is likely to be stronger than PEO. Thanks for the question Ramsey. Yes, it is a great question because we always think really, really hard about pricing decisions and making sure that we don't get greedy. As we've shared on many occasions, what we are interested in is long-term clients and the lifetime value of those clients. So we are always very, very careful not to over rotate on price. And you are right, we have been able to take about 150 basis points in '23 and '24. And as we look to '25 and we looked at the moderating inflation environment, we thought that 100 basis points is realistic. If we go back pre '23 and back into the teens we were more on the 50 basis points range, but the inflation environment was very, very different then it was virtually not existent. So we are confident that we can get 100 basis points. We are confident that we can target it in the right places. So it is something that we think is a reasonable expectation for us to target. No, Samad, it is a great question. So there are a few things happening if you look forward to 2025, revenue is growing, but the biggest contributor to the revenue growth is zero margin pass-throughs. So that's the largest component, and that's what's happening there. And then, of course, we have mentioned earlier that pays per control are under pressure. So as I said in an earlier answer, 1% to 2% for ES, and we think more towards the low end of that for the PEO area. And then we have a little bit of pressure from workman's compensation on the margin. And I guess the third thing is we do continue to focus on the area to get sales reaccelerating. So we certainly have more selling expense baked in to that business to help drive the top-line and make sure we get to continue to grow our worksite employees. Yes, certainly. We've talked about this before. But if we go back a year or so, I think -- or maybe 18 months, the word recession was on people's lips a lot more frequently than it is today. I think the latest survey I've seen says that there is about a 28% probability of recession in the next 12 months. I'm sure that's some survey that the rest of you have read somewhere as well. So the good news is, it looks very unlikely that we are going to have a recession over the next 12 months. But certainly, as an all-weather company, what we do isn't discretionary. You have to do it. The levers we have, if sales slow commissions slow, if implementations slow, we don't need as much headcount, et cetera, et cetera. But I think, as we saw in 2008, it took a long time for ADP to find itself in a place that looked like a lot of adjustment. So we think that we can use those tools again should we need to. But I'll just finish with hopefully, that survey is correct and nobody is thinking about a recession in the next 12 months. Yes. So Tien-Tsin, thanks for the question. I think that we are always -- I'll start with where you ended there. We are always looking at the workforce and making sure we're -- we've got the right people in the right places and the right numbers of people in the right places. So we're always looking at that. I don't think there is any real specific callouts on the margin. I think that there are some Gen AI investments. These are modest, but they do attract 10, 20 bps here and there, so to speak. But they are modest all things considered. Certainly, the margin next year would get a little bit of pressure from lower pays per control from lower pricing increases and from lower client fund interest, specifically -- most specifically in the back half. But I think those are all things that we've called out and you can read through. So nothing abnormal. Yes. Hi Bryan, I think it's going to take a little bit of time. And we were working, and as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing some more margin pressure in PEO, and some of that is because of the investments we are making in the sales force to make sure we can get those bookings going. But realistically, to get to kind of Investor Day guidance that we provided three years ago, it is going to take some time to build that back. So we are definitely focused on that, and we are definitely focused on getting there. Of course, if we were to see some reacceleration in the pays per control, that would put lots of wind in the sails, but it's going to take a little bit of time to get back to where we want to be. No. Good question, Scott. More on the shape of expenses. Revenue expectations throughout the year are pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter. It is really some spending patterns we have in the first half of the year, but really nothing specific to call out. Just want to give folks a heads up that we think we are going to be stronger in the back half than the first. Caroline, thanks for the question. So we do have a laddered strategy. So if you actually refer to the -- I think, the last page of the earnings release, I think you can see the maturity schedule for our investments. And you can see that, for example in 2025, we have $6 billion that's maturing at roughly 2.2%, and our reinvestment at this point in time is 4.2%. So there's still lots of opportunity, and this is a place where ADP's laddering strategy shows its strength. It is fair to say that over the last couple of years, because of the inverted yield curve, we did have some opportunity cost by having this strategy. But I think we are very much seeing that as yield curves start to normalize, that we still have lots of opportunity for client funds interest growth. I\u2019d just add to that that the portfolio is continuing to grow. It's growing 3% to 4% again next year, maybe not as much as it has in the past couple of years because wages have moderated a little bit, pays per control moderated a little bit. But we are still seeing good growth in that area. So we still have lots of opportunity. And the most important thing here, the most important comment I can make on this whole fund strategy, is that we base all of these commitments or all of these expectations on the current yield curve. We're not trying to outguess the market. We're looking at what the market in general has to say. And we are using those yield curves to put together our forecasts and our guidance on interest rates. David, as Maria has shared earlier, I mean, we're always looking to make sure that we've got the workforce at the size it needs to be and in the places it needs to be. So we made those difficult decisions that we had to make on behalf of some of those employees. But we always look at this. And if you look at ADP over the years, we've always done what needed to be done to go forward. So I would just leave it at that and say that we're very happy with the guidance we put out here and the margin guidance as well. So we will make sure that we do what we need to do to execute, and we'll see what the future brings. But as we sit here today, we've done what we need to do, and we are looking forward to the future."

I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Danny Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanny Hussain: Thank you, Michelle, and welcome everyone to ADP's third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risks. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I'll now turn it over to Maria.\nMaria Black: Thank you, Danny, and thank you everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported strong 7% revenue growth and 14% adjusted diluted EPS growth for the third quarter as we continued to make progress delivering against our strategic priorities and as the labor market and the overall HCM business environment remained stable. I'll begin with a review of the quarter's results and provide a brief update on our strategy before turning it to Don to update you on our outlook and share some early considerations for next year. In Q3, we delivered solid Employer Services new business bookings growth reaching record bookings for our Q3 period and keeping us on track for our full-year outlook. We maintained momentum in our small business portfolio with particularly strong growth in our retirement services offering, and in Q3, we also delivered strong bookings results in our midmarket, enterprise and international businesses. With a steady demand backdrop and a healthy new business pipeline, we are focused on continuing to execute for the remainder of the year. Employer Services retention was very strong in the third quarter and once again exceeded our expectations also reaching a new record level for our Q3 period led by our midmarket business. Our overall retention continues to benefit from ongoing investments in our key platforms and from our commitment to delivering an exceptional client experience, which together helped our client satisfaction scores reach a new all-time high for our Q3. Our Employer Services pays per control growth was steady at 2% reflecting the resilient overall U.S. labor market and the fact that our clients continue to add to their workforces at a moderate pace, and our PEO revenue growth of 5% for the third quarter was in line with our expectations despite continued short-term pressure from below normal hiring activity we've been experiencing among those clients. Moving on to a broader update, we continue to push forward on our three strategic priorities, leading with the best HCM technology, unmatched service and expertise in a broader scale to ultimately deliver the best possible experience not just to the buyers of our products but everyone that engages with ADP. We are investing with purpose to deeply understand and deliver value to a vast set of personas from small business owners that count on us to HR professionals and executives of the largest global enterprises to millions of employees and gig workers around the world who engage with our solutions through CPAs, banks, brokers and other key partners to our thousands of dedicated service and implementation associates and to our sellers who represent ADP in the market every day. It's with these personas in mind that we continue pushing forward on our strategic priorities, and in Q3, we made steady progress. Our first priority is to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. We've been rolling out ADP Assist these past couple of quarters, which as a reminder will be embedded in our key platforms and utilizes GenAI to surface insights, aid decision-making and streamline day-to-day tasks for our clients and their employees. In Q3, we were very excited to begin piloting a new feature that enables our small business clients to not only leverage GenAI to answer questions and better understand how to initiate an HR action which we outlined in recent quarters but to actually allow them to issue commands to complete that HR action. For example, users can now type I need to rehire Alex or I would like to give Alex a leave of absence and are expedited through that workflow. Our second priority is to provide unmatched expertise in outsourcing. We continue to extend GenAI capabilities to a broader portion of our service associates, and in Q3, we started rolling out a new tool for some of our implementation teams. Now they can use GenAI to take in unstructured client employee data reducing manual data entry and minimizing errors during the implementation process. While it's still early, we are excited about its potential benefits. Our third priority is to benefit our clients with our global scale. The ADP marketplace remains a differentiator for us and is a perfect example of a benefit our clients receive from partnering with the leader in HCM. As a growing number of our hundreds of partners offer AI-enabled solutions, in Q3, we established ADP marketplace AI principles that require our partners to commit for the same type of responsible AI principles that govern our own products including human oversight, monitoring, explainability and mitigating bias. Our clients put a huge amount of trust in us and this is another example of how ADP strives to ensure the responsible use of AI throughout the ADP ecosystem. We also continued to extend our market-leading global scale, and in Q3, we reached 1 million paid employees on our I-HCM platform, which continues to scale in several countries in Europe and we made further progress in growing our presence in the APAC region, where we have recently been expanding our in-country payroll and workforce management presence in a number of markets. In 2024, we are celebrating our 75th anniversary and we pride ourselves on having built ourselves into a brand that truly matters to employers, their employees and the broader world of work. Our focus on our strategic priorities positions us to deliver more value than ever for our over 1 million current clients and to the tens of thousands of new clients we welcome to the ADP family every quarter. I'd like to highlight just a few of these new client wins from Q3 to give you an appreciation for the variety of ways in which we deliver value for them. In U.S. small business, we had a new Boutique Donut Shop referred to us from one of our CPA partners. The client chose ADP for the strength of our run platform, our reputation for great service, our strong relationship with our CPA and our ability to provide retirement services. Since this was a first time small business owner, our sales team even took the time to help the business owner set up their business the right way from guiding the client on obtaining a state tax ID to making sure the client obtained the appropriate workers compensation insurance. In U.S. midmarket, we won a multistate operator of rehabilitation centers, this client wasn't happy with our prior HCM provider and Workforce Now proved a much better fit. What makes me the most proud in this example is how one of our ADP marketplace partners played a key role in the decision to switch to ADP by independently highlighting the advantages we offered in terms of ease of integrations, a capability we have invested in over the years. In U.S. enterprise, we welcomed a large luxury resort that operates multiple hotels, restaurants and retail stores on site and was dissatisfied with the prior provider's level of client service. The client was so happy following their seamless ADP implementation, which included onsite training for their HR team that they accelerated their plans to add-on features like benefits, recruiting, onboarding, wage garnishment and tax credits. In our International business, one recent win was a leading airline that utilized ADP in certain countries and asked us to help better define their global payroll strategy. Ultimately, they expanded the scope of our services to include in additional 18 countries and started that rollout in the third quarter with plans to add other countries over the next year to enable true consolidated global reporting and analytics. And as a final example, our HRO team started a New York-based design firm after its leadership team recognized the company lacked the HR infrastructure required to adequately attract and retain the right talent. They turned to our PEO offering for truly comprehensive support, attracted by the breadth of our offering including features like the MyLife Advisors program, which supports employees as they make benefit in other important life decisions. We also advise this client in the development of a comprehensive benefits strategy to support their multigenerational workforce and help them attract the talent that they need to grow. As you can tell from these examples, it's often a combination of our technology, expertise and overall breadth that resonated with these businesses, and the result is incredible diversity in our client base and a resilient overall business model. We look forward to leaning in and delivering even greater differentiation in the market going forward. Overall, we were pleased with the strong financial and strategic outcomes in the third quarter. I'd like to thank our associates who continued to deliver exceptional products and service to our clients, in whose efforts drive these client wins and retention. Thank you again for all you do for ADP and for our clients. And now, I'll turn it over to Don.\nDon McGuire: Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide more color on our results for the quarter and our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. Overall, we reported a strong third quarter with our consolidated revenue growth and our adjusted EBIT margin coming in a bit above our expectations. The interest rate backdrop has improved since we last provided our full year outlook, so we are updating our outlook for that as well as making a few other changes, which I'll detail. I'll start with Employer Services. ES segment revenue grew 8% on a reported basis and 7% on an organic constant currency basis. As Maria shared, we had a good quarter in ES new business bookings with broad-based growth across our client segments. We have a tough compare in Q4 following last year's strong finish but with a steady HCM demand environment and healthy pipelines, we feel on track to deliver our 4% to 7% new business bookings growth outlook for the year. Also, as Maria mentioned earlier, our ES retention exceeded our expectations and increased slightly from last year. Given our continued strong retention performance, we are increasing our full-year retention outlook slightly, we now anticipate a 20 to 30 basis point decline in full year retention which is better than our prior forecast. ES pays per control growth held steady at 2% in Q3 and we now expect growth to round to 2% for the year, the high end of our prior 1% to 2% growth outlook, and client funds interest revenue exceed our expectations in Q3 due to higher average client funds balances and a slightly better average yield. We are revising our full-year client funds interest outlook to reflect our Q3 results and the increase in prevailing interest rates since our last update. We now expect fiscal '24 average client funds balance growth of about 3% and we are raising our expectations for client fund's interest revenue and net impact from our client fund's extended investment strategy. In total, there is no change to our fiscal '24 ES revenue growth forecast of 7% to 8%, although we are now likely to come in towards the higher end of that range. Our ES margin increased 230 basis points in Q3, driven both by operating leverage and the contribution from client funds interest revenue growth. With our strong Q3 results and the slightly more favorable client funds interest rate backdrop, we are raising our fiscal '24 ES margin outlook and now anticipate growth of 180 to 190 basis points. Moving onto the PEO. We had 5% revenue growth driven by 3% growth in average work site employees in the third quarter, representing slight acceleration from the first half of the year. These results were largely in line with our expectations and we were encouraged by the gradual stabilization in our PEO's pays per control growth which decelerated but only slightly from the prior quarter. We continued to anticipate soft pays per control growth through the end of the year and expect work-site employee growth to hold steady at about 3% keeping us on track for our full-year outlook for work-site employee growth of 2% to 3% and revenue growth of 3% to 4%. PEO margin decreased 220 basis points in Q3. As we shared last quarter, we expect this year's workers' compensation reserve release benefit to be significantly lower than what we experienced these last few years, and in particular, last year's $73 million benefit. We are updating our fiscal '24 outlook to now assume a minimal release benefit, and as a result, we are further revising our overall PEO margin expectation to be down 120 to 140 basis points in fiscal '24 versus our prior expectation for a decline of 80 to 100 basis points. Putting it all together, there is no change to our fiscal '24 consolidated revenue growth of 6% to 7%. With the two changes to segment margins, largely offsetting one another, we continue to expect our adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 60 to 70 basis points. We still anticipate an effective tax rate of around 23% and we continue to expect fiscal '24 adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12% with the middle of that range still the most likely outcome. As we look ahead to fiscal '25, I wanted to share a couple of early thoughts at this point. First, give them the fullness of the labor market, we are planning for pays per control growth to once again be below normal levels next year and to decelerate modestly from this year's growth level in both ES and our PEO segments with the resulting revenue pressure more apparent in the PEO segment given its more direct revenue sensitivity to work-site employees. We will of course share those exact assumptions with you when we give our formal guidance in a few months. On the expense side, we are also planning to continue growing our GenAI related spend next year. As you've heard from us all year long, there are many ways we can put GenAI in the hands of all of the different stakeholders that work with or on behalf of ADP, including our client practitioners, their employees, our service and implementation teams, our sellers and our developers. These are critical investments and they are the right investments for ADP, but we expect the associated benefits and productivity of growth to phasing gradually over time likely representing overall margin pressure for the year. At the same time, we appear positioned for continued tailwind from interest rates, though the extent of this benefit will of course depend on how the yield curve continues to develop. As usual, we're focused primarily on maintaining good momentum in our new business bookings and maintaining our strong client satisfaction and retention and we remain upbeat about our strategy for the years ahead. And now over to Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\nOwen Callahan: Hi, this is Owen on for Ramsey. Thanks for taking our question this morning. So, you're currently entering your open enrollment season for client benefit elections within the PEO. I was wondering if you could talk about trends you're seeing there thus far, you called out some stability in regard to insurance price inflation driving more attached rates, are you seeing any of this follow through? Any thoughts there might be helpful. Thanks.\nMaria Black: Good morning. I was going to say good morning, Owen. How about I start and I'll let Don chime in. I think the comment would be, just to start, we are smack in the middle of our open enrollment season exactly as you suggested, and so, it's probably too early to make a call in terms of what that's going to look like from a full year perspective on the retention side. But overall, we have seen a bit, a tiny bit of PEO retention improvement this year and the compares are getting a bit easier and we do expect some improvement for the full year. So with that, I'll let Don chime in.\nDon McGuire: Sorry, I jumped again there. So, Maria, thank you. Perfect answer. Thank you.\nOwen Callahan: Great. Super helpful. And then, if I may, just on client retention continues to sort of surprise to the upside, I was wondering drivers there, I previously thought potentially fewer bankruptcies in the down market but any expectations more longer term might be helpful there?\nMaria Black: Yes, absolutely. We're very pleased with the overall retention results. I think you see that in our revised outlook, you see that in the revision we made last quarter as well. And so, just to remind everybody just how well retention is going, fiscal '23 was a record, that record was really driven by the mid-market and international and the down market actually did decline a bit in fiscal '23 and we expect pretty much the same outlook, if you will, for full year '24, which is why we still have a down year-on-year retention result, but we're incredibly pleased with overall what we're seeing with client retention, that's really being led by a combination of things, one of which is the investments we made into product, the record results we have in terms of client satisfaction, that in and of itself was a record in the third quarter, along with retention. So, we're very, very pleased with that. As mentioned, there's still down market variability and there's down market out of business. We haven't seen it thus far this year but we still expect it to normalize a bit further. And then there's always normal variability in retention. So, we believe the retention guide is the appropriate one, but certainly we're very pleased with the record quarter and where we sit with retention thus far this year.\nOwen Callahan: Great. Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nZack Ajzenman: Hi, thanks. This is Zack Ajzenman on for Bryan. First question, just want to dig in on the ES revenue growth affirmation despite the higher retention at PPC views, heard that you might come in towards the higher end of the range, but perhaps you can elaborate on some of the underlying assumptions and any offset?\nDon McGuire: Yes, so a couple of things, Zack. Maria already mentioned that retention is in very good shape for us, so certainly that's been helping and contributing to the revenue growth. And of course what's changed since last time around which is making us even more comfortable with saying we're going to be towards the higher end of the range is that client funds interest impact is very good. So, I think those are the two primary drivers to why we're more confident that we're going to see revenue come in towards the higher end of the seven to eight than we perhaps worth 90 days ago.\nZack Ajzenman: Got it. And a follow up on demand ES new business bookings affirmed at 4% to 7% growth, what are the strongest segments of the market and any notable changes to call out versus the second quarter?\nMaria Black: Sure. So, first and foremost, we feel good about the overall demand environments. Companies are still hiring as we saw today and they're still investing as such in people, in HCM. The call outs, I made a few of them during the prepared remarks, but it's really -- the down market continues to impress us this quarter specifically in retirement services, so I'd make a call out there, it's quite fantastic to see that story and retirement services come together. We talked quite a bit about secular tailwinds in that space based on legislation that coupled with the investments we've been making, an incredible distribution execution, really great to see the retirement services leading the way. I think other areas that I would call out that have been remarkably strong is our mid-market as well as international. And so, again, similar story to retirement services, and that it's really a great story coming together between investments and execution, and enterprise also was strong for us for the quarter. And in terms of anything changing broad-based, we haven't really seen anything change in the demand environment. Quite candidly, we feel really strong as suggested by the overall hiring landscape and the labor demand.\nZack Ajzenman: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Hi, good morning, and thanks for the terrific updates. Client retention obviously really strong, obviously your scores continue to go up. Are there any areas that you would call out that are standing out in terms of driving the higher NPS scores and the higher client retention? Anything that you would particularly note?\nMaria Black: Good morning, Mark. I would say to you mid-market on both of those. So, mid-market is driving the strong NPS scores to record highs. The mid-market is driving incredible retention. So that's the one call out. You can probably hear the optimism in my voice there because it's a fantastic story coming together, but I think overall retention is incredibly strong. The mid-market international in fiscal '23 were very strong, they continue to be strong, but that's really the one call out I would make is the mid-market.\nMark Marcon: Great. And then Maria there's one area that investors have been asking more about and you have -- you and ADP have the broadest outlook with regards to the space, so I'm asking this on the call, but some people wonder a little bit about saturation, your new bookings continue to grow but investors are asking a little bit more about like how much room do we have for new solutions or how many clients have already upgraded, things of that nature? Your results and the results of some of your peers continue to blow their concerns, but I'm wondering if you could address those?\nMaria Black: Yes, absolutely, Mark. I'll give it a shot and certainly happy to have Don chime in. Maybe he can talk a little bit about our growth opportunity in international, but I think, broadly speaking, when you think about the total addressable market of the HCM space and where we all play and we all compete and it's highly competitive and there's been a lot of investments coming into the space over the past few years. What I would suggest is there's still tremendous amount of growth and growth upside for all of us, and as you mentioned, we continued to deliver that and the results that we see on the new business booking side. And so, I think overall there is still runway, there's still plenty of space. I think the part for us outside of our incredible distribution organization which has always been a competitive advantage in how we go to market, that distribution is also anchored to our ability to upsell to the base. So you mentioned this ability to upgrade and how much has upgraded and are we all the way there? What I would suggest to you is, we're still at about 50% as it relates to new business bookings coming from, call it, new business, net new business versus upgrades, which suggests to me that we still have a tremendous amount of opportunity even within our base. And that's a lot of the focus that we have as an organization, whether it's in the PEO getting smarter about which clients within employer services that we target to offer to the PEO or it's the work that we're doing on generative AI to try to get upsell and offering the right product to the right client at the right time. And in my mind, bending the curve and continuing to focus on attach rates whether that's on the point of sale or omni-attach at a later time is definitely an opportunity for us to continue to deliver bookings in a very broad market that still has a tremendous amount of opportunity for all of us, but moreover, where we continue to execute and deliver on that. So, I don't know, Don, if you want to comment a little bit on international in terms of the opportunity there?\nDon McGuire: Yes, perhaps to add a little bit more color, I think we're very still very optimistic about growth opportunities beyond the U.S. or the North American market. So, Mark, I think we've talked before we're on the ground in 40 plus countries outside of the U.S. We're present in multiple segments in those markets as well. We've got some great things happening in Southeast Asia where we're rolling out a single platform across beginning in India but many countries surrounding India and the Southeast Asian market. We're excited, we often talk about the fact that we pay over a million people in India, every payroll, every payday. Price points are still a bit low, but we expect those things to work for us and work in our favor in the future. So, I think still lots and lots of opportunity for ADP from a growth perspective and certainly we don't worry about saturation being a limiter to our future.\nMark Marcon: That's what I thought. Thanks for -- appreciate the complete answers.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Wurtzel: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to go back to some of the early thoughts Don that you provided on fiscal '25 and talking about the GenAI investments and I think you had mentioned that there could be some margin pressure associated with that, and just wanted to clarify were you talking about potentially leading margin to be down year-over-year or are there other offsets with general operating leverage and interest income that can potentially offset the margin pressure from those investments? Thanks.\nDon McGuire: Yes, Scott, thanks for the question. I think it's still early. I think the intent here was to give some very early guidance on what '25 could look like. So, we still expect to see some improvements in margins. It's just, do we expect to see as much of an improvement given some of the GenAI pressures, expense pressures that we may see. Of course, CFI, at this point in time, depending what the yield curve does, once again things have changed a fair bit in the last 90 days, and if I was to, not that I have a crystal ball, but I don't think many folks right now are expecting anything to change from the rates perspective in the U.S. before September, so I think we're going to get some tailwinds from that. So, we're not really trying to signal here -- not signaling a decline in our margins, what we're signaling perhaps is perhaps a slower growth in the margins as we look into '25.\nScott Wurtzel: Got it. That's super helpful. And then just wanted to go onto the PEO segment and going back to some of the verticals that we've talked about over the last year in technology and professional services, just wondering if you can update us on some of the trends you've seen there with pays per control growth. I mean, even looking at the employment report that you guys released this morning, it looks like professional services is stabilizing and increasing, but technology information seems a little bit choppy. So, just wondering if you can talk about trends in the PEO with respect to those verticals?\nDon McGuire: Sure, so if I, you know, Maria talked a little bit about bookings, I think, so we've been, we were happy with our bookings. They softened a little bit in Q3, but we had a very, very strong Q2 on PEO bookings. We can move on kind of to the PPC growth. Back in Q1, it decelerated a little bit more than we anticipated, and a significant amount of that deceleration was attributed to the technology and professional services sector. And in Q2, that stabilized. So that was good for us. While there's still some headwinds in PPC, including from technology and service sectors, there were no surprises in Q3. So it's important to note that worksite employee growth accelerated, about 1% over Q2, despite the modest incremental pressure we had from PPC pressure. And so, and that, of course, is a function of the year-to-date booking success that we've had. So nothing really to call out. More stability, if you will, in PPC pressure than we've talked about previously.\nScott Wurtzel: Great, thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thanks, good morning. Thanks for going through all this. Anything on the pricing side worth sharing, Maria? Just thinking about some of the peer commentary out there. Any call-outs or interesting observations?\nMaria Black: In terms of, from a standpoint of our price, or pricing in the market from a demand?\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes, your pricing, or as you're thinking about resetting prices as you go into the usual seasonal time changes, price changes, any thoughts there? So both for new renewals as well as new deal bids?\nMaria Black: Yes, absolutely. So I think my general sentiments, and then Don can give the kind of a little more directional, but my general sentiments around price remain that we're very thoughtful, and very measured as it relates to how we think about price, whether that's on the new business side, or it's on the renewal side, as you mentioned. And so for us, it's about understanding kind of by segment. So you heard my commentary in the prepared remarks, just how broad and deep and diverse ADP is, with respect to our client base. As you can imagine, we think about a down market, price increased differently than perhaps an enterprise. Some of those are also long-term contracts that have indexes attached. And so all of that lends itself to a very surgical approach, right? To ensure that the price value equation remains the right one, for the market and for our clients. And obviously at the same time, what we're doing is also monitoring what's happening in the HCM space with respect to the peer group and pricing overall. And I would say from a competitive lens, we haven't seen anything unusual as it relates to price from us or the others, even though it continues to be a highly competitive environment. And so as such, our approach this year to price, which I'll let Don comment on, has been very thoughtful and I would expect us to take that same measured approach as we had into '25.\nDon McGuire: Yes, so the price increase this year was relatively well-received. We're in the 100, 150 basis point range. We're closer to the 150. So happy with where we're at. But back to Maria's comments, we're in the middle of our planning cycle right now, and we'll look very carefully at that whole value equation, making sure that we keep our retention up. Our NPS is supporting that, and we'll make sure that we're mindful and thoughtful about what we do with pricing going forward.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes, no I'm sure it'd be thoughtful about it. Thank you for that. Just on the GenAI front, I respect the investments there. I'm curious if you were to classify it as either driving expense efficiency versus driving better sales efficiency, what are you really aiming for with some of these investments here for fiscal '25?\nMaria Black: Oh. The answer is both. So I think it's really about solving for, again, all of the users that interact with ADP, right? So if you think about all the personas, our clients, our clients' employees, and our service agents, our sellers, it's really about putting GenAI in every part of our ecosystem. So in terms of what are we solving for, the answer is both. We're trying to drive greater service efficiency. I think, we've proven out that through digital transformation and taking friction out of our products and making those investments, we have the ability to drive up our NPS results and record client satisfaction tends to lead to similar record retention. So definitely working on ensuring that we're driving up retention. Obviously, the more happy clients we have, the easier it is for our sellers. We're also investing into generative AI for our sellers, to become more productive. So it is about service productivity. It's about seller productivity. It's about client experience. Client experience lends itself to retention. So I guess it's just one happy virtuous cycle, but I think - my answer is both, and all of it is what we hope to gain. Now, again, kind of back to the investments we're making and what Don alluded to in terms of any pressure we would have with respect to margin on those investments. Some of these investments, we know they're the right thing for ADP, but they will take time to ultimately garner all of the results, in all of these categories that I just mentioned. And so, as it stands today, we have some really exciting things that we're seeing. If you think about something, like call summarization that I've spoken about in the past. And we're shaving off roughly a minute per call, that doesn't probably sound that exciting. But you think about a minute per call over time, and you think about how many calls we take broadly across ADP in a given year. The math lends itself to over time, tremendous efficiency, and again, hopefully a better experience, right? So I think the answer is all of it. We're solving for all of it.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, everyone. It's [indiscernible] for James. Thanks for taking our question. Just one for me today. You mentioned coming in at the higher end of the range on ES for the full year, which makes sense given some of your commentary on booking strength, better retention, pace for control, improvement in the float benefit that we're seeing. But given all of those factors, it looks like ES in the quarter came broadly in line with our expectations, despite all of those tailwinds. So I'm curious, given your commentary about price coming in towards the higher end of your historical range, what does that imply just in terms of what you're seeing on the net new side, as well as cross-sell and upsell? Thanks.\nDon McGuire: Yes, Michael, thanks for the question. I think that, first of all, the price, there's no change in that. I think we've been calling that out for most of the year, certainly in the one to 150 range. So not much of an incremental impact, if you will, for Q4 and therefore for the year in total. So not a lot of change from that. Yes, I mean, bookings, we called out, we're still in the hunt for delivering on the range as we declared, so we're still in that so. But not really a lot to drive incremental revenue, other than some of the float, but as the year shortens or we have fewer months, days left in the year, the impact from higher CFI is going to be somewhat muted as we look to finish the year.\nDanny Hussain: Hi Michael, it's Danny. If you're wondering whether there is some offset somewhere else, there's a little bit from FX moving adversely relative to our prior expectations.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi. Your line is open.\nPete Christiansen: Good morning. Thank you for the question. Maria, you gave great explanation of the wallet share opportunity that still left earlier, PEO, propensity modeling with GenAI and then international. I want to dig into the international side a little bit, particularly some of the newer markets that you're getting into. I'm just hoping you can give us a bit of a progress report on a lot of the last mile infrastructure that, you've been putting in place, go-to-market, ramping that up. And I'm just curious, should we think of like the deployment of PI, the next-gen payroll engine in the international, as a real catalyst - for the next leg of booking growth? Thank you. I appreciate it.\nMaria Black: Yes, thanks, Pete. I think that was a solid like three, four questions in one. So I will, I'll do my best to weave through it here. But as Don mentioned, we're on the ground in 40 countries. We do payroll across 140 countries, inclusive of our partner network. In terms of the final mile or the last mile, as you referenced, the first thing I would comment on is we've building that 50 years. So when I think about international and everything we've done over the course of decades to build that infrastructure, it's a tremendous lead is what I would suggest. And you see that in our international bookings results, right? So we had a nice first quarter in international. We accelerated that in the second quarter. We had an even better Q3. A lot of that is being driven by our multinational growth. So think about our Celergo offering, our GlobalView offering. These were especially strong for us in the third quarter. And I do believe it's the overall demand environment coupled with - on the ground strategy, if you will, if you will. And by the way, the international pipelines remain healthy. And we believe it's going to position us for a solid Q4, but also next year. In terms of, where we continue to expand. I mentioned it in my prepared remarks. Asia-Pac or APAC is something that, our Asia business has been relatively modest, but we see significant growth over time. Obviously, that growth is a direct byproduct of our clients demand growth, as it relates to the activities of our clients and where they're moving associates, and where they're moving business. So, we believe that continuing to lean into Asia-Pac is important for us. And so as a result of that, we kind of are continuing to lean in there. I think we mentioned last quarter, the acquisition of a company in the Nordics, specifically in Sweden. So that's an area that also is a high growth area from a client perspective. And so I think, our strategy over time has been as we get further into a country and we see the demand, at times we will fold in our partners. And you've seen that obviously in the Nordics, and you've seen that in many countries prior to that. But that ecosystem is vast across 140 countries. Its decades of building that final mile. It's a clear competitive differentiator in the market. You can feel see and it's really palpable on the heels of the last earnings call. I was actually over at our rethink event, which is where we bring together a few hundred of our very largest global MNC clients. And the spirit of how we're executing in that market is really palpable, when you hear it directly from our clients. And I believe it's a tremendous opportunity for us to continue to drive growth. So I think, I covered all of that, Pete.\nPete Christiansen: Thank you, Maria. Just quick follow-up. Do you think that the deployment of next-gen payroll is a catalyst for going-to-market and some of those newer markets?\nMaria Black: Yes, of course. So next-gen payroll, for sure, our intent is to continue to drive next-gen payroll, across various international markets. We have it deployed in a few of our markets today. And that coupled with these offers that again have the lead of Celergo going GlobalView over time, will just further the growth narrative and the story over there. But that is absolutely the intention and the strategic direction of next-gen payroll.\nPete Christiansen: Thank you for the comprehensive call.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra with the RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nDavid Paige: Hi. This is David Paige on Ashish. It was great to hear about your results and growth in the mid-market particles. I was wondering if you could just give a little bit of an overview on the competitive landscape there. Are you guys taking share or the entire market or just what's the outlook or the environment in terms of competition in the market? Thank you.\nMaria Black: Yes, absolutely. So the mid-market is a great segment for us. It's certainly not getting any easier to be an employer in the mid-market. It's littered with complexity and all sorts of challenges to navigate, just even if you look at the last 30 days, you can see legislation that mid-market employers are having to navigate. And so it's a strong market. It is a highly competitive space. That's not new. I think for - from a competitive landscape perspective, it's always been competitive. And I don't know that we've seen a noticeable changes in the competitive landscape. What we have seen is incredible distribution, execution, incredible satisfaction, execution on our end. We've made great investments into the product set. It's winning in the market. You marry that strategy with great execution on the seller side and great execution on the retention side. That, to me, is what's changing in the mid-market is that we've gotten stronger.\nDavid Paige: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [Caroline Lada] on for Jason. Thanks for taking our question. Sorry to double down on price, but just given the way inflation isn't dropping off, maybe the way the market was hoping or expecting recently. Do you have any updated expectations about ADP, and like the broader peer group's ability to raise pricing heading into the fourth quarter, and 2025 without like significant pushback?\nDon McGuire: Caroline, thanks for the question. I think it just comes - continues to come back to the same concepts, and that's making sure that we offer good value to our customers over a 10-plus year lifespan. So, we're always mindful of making sure that clients are getting good value, and that we keep those clients for a very, very long time. So it's that client life cycle of the total return on the entire life of a client. So, we're always very, very careful not to overstep on pricing. Having said that, we, of course, watch what the competition is doing. We have our ear to the ground. Our salespeople have their ear to the ground. We're trying to make sure and understand what's happening from the competition. So, we will continue to look at it. We'll continue to knock around some ideas, and some models and see what the impact could be. But I don't want to signal exactly what we think we're doing, because we're still, as I said earlier, in the midst of our planning cycle here. But we always look at it. We take price usually every year where we can, not including some of the contractual commitments we have with some of our larger clients, but just something we're very, very careful and cautious about doing shots a lot of color.\nUnidentified Analyst: Awesome, thank you. That adds a lot of color.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.\nKartik Mehta: Good morning. Maria, as you look at the mid-market and the success ADP is having, who are you winning market share from? Is it traditional payroll companies? Are there companies that are maybe using other software products that you wouldn't consider payroll companies? I'm just wondering where the success is coming from?\nMaria Black: Everywhere. Candidly, listen, from a mid-market perspective, again, the demand is healthy. The competitive environment is competitive, and we continue to remain laser-focused on all of the competitors specifically. The ones that have been talking a lot about us over the last few years. And I think the way that we've been focused is really about the investments we've made, investments into a best-in-class product. Investments into focus on distribution investments into a digital transformation that's driving great client satisfaction. And so, that really has allowed us to have a winning story, as it relates to really all of the players.\nKartik Mehta: And then just one follow-up. Just on the PEO business, as you look at the long-term growth perspective of that business, obviously, there's been - a couple of things that happened that maybe have slowed the growth down in the last year or so. I'm wondering just your outlook on the PEO business and if you think anything has changed in that business, or demand for the product?\nMaria Black: Yes. So I'm happy to start and certainly happy to have Don chime in too on the PEO. I'm always very, very bullish on the PEO value proposition. I've been close to that business for a long time, and I will tell you it's stronger than it's ever been. So despite the strangeness that we've had in the PEO, from a kind of the componentry heading into the pandemic, during the pandemic after the pandemic and then now, call it, a little bit post, post pandemic. What I would suggest to you is it has nothing to do with the fundamentals of that business, and what we would expect over time from a growth perspective long-term. And so the value proposition is strong. Nothing from our end has changed there, as it relates to the overall demand from the business. And we see that just in the - we continue to have 50% of our clients into the PEO coming from the base. So it's resonating with our existing clients. It's resonating with the open market, and it continues to be a very strong offering for us. So I don't know, Don, if you want to add anything there?\nDon McGuire: Nothing to add then the value proposition is as strong as ever, and the fundamentals in the business are continue to be quite strong.\nKartik Mehta: Thank you very much. I really appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. We have one more question from Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Hi guys, thank you for taking my question. And apologies, I was on a different call. But I know it's kind of maybe early, but do you have any news about - your next fiscal year, maybe something like early views as we head into the fourth quarter? Thank you.\nDon McGuire: Yes. Dan, just a couple of things, thinking about next year. We do think that it's early, so we didn't share too much, although we did say that the pace per control will continue to be under a little bit of pressure, given the fullness of the labor market. So that's kind of continuing story that we've been telling. We will continue some of our GenAI spending related spending, making the right investments for ADP. And of course, we're going to get some tailwind from interest rates. So I think those are the three primary things. And of course, we always remain very, very focused on bookings and our strong client retention and client experience. So, I think those would be the highlights for '25.\nDan Dolev: Okay. Appreciate it. And apologies again if this was already addressed. I was on a different call. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Maria Black for any closing remarks.\nMaria Black: Yes. Thank you, and thank you once again to everyone who joined us today, whether the full time or late. We always appreciate the questions, the interest, and we certainly look forward to speaking with all of you again soon, and look forward to the close of the year. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

            "name": "Maria Black",
            "content": "Thank you, Danny, and thank you everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported strong 7% revenue growth and 14% adjusted diluted EPS growth for the third quarter as we continued to make progress delivering against our strategic priorities and as the labor market and the overall HCM business environment remained stable. I'll begin with a review of the quarter's results and provide a brief update on our strategy before turning it to Don to update you on our outlook and share some early considerations for next year. In Q3, we delivered solid Employer Services new business bookings growth reaching record bookings for our Q3 period and keeping us on track for our full-year outlook. We maintained momentum in our small business portfolio with particularly strong growth in our retirement services offering, and in Q3, we also delivered strong bookings results in our midmarket, enterprise and international businesses. With a steady demand backdrop and a healthy new business pipeline, we are focused on continuing to execute for the remainder of the year. Employer Services retention was very strong in the third quarter and once again exceeded our expectations also reaching a new record level for our Q3 period led by our midmarket business. Our overall retention continues to benefit from ongoing investments in our key platforms and from our commitment to delivering an exceptional client experience, which together helped our client satisfaction scores reach a new all-time high for our Q3. Our Employer Services pays per control growth was steady at 2% reflecting the resilient overall U.S. labor market and the fact that our clients continue to add to their workforces at a moderate pace, and our PEO revenue growth of 5% for the third quarter was in line with our expectations despite continued short-term pressure from below normal hiring activity we've been experiencing among those clients. Moving on to a broader update, we continue to push forward on our three strategic priorities, leading with the best HCM technology, unmatched service and expertise in a broader scale to ultimately deliver the best possible experience not just to the buyers of our products but everyone that engages with ADP. We are investing with purpose to deeply understand and deliver value to a vast set of personas from small business owners that count on us to HR professionals and executives of the largest global enterprises to millions of employees and gig workers around the world who engage with our solutions through CPAs, banks, brokers and other key partners to our thousands of dedicated service and implementation associates and to our sellers who represent ADP in the market every day. It's with these personas in mind that we continue pushing forward on our strategic priorities, and in Q3, we made steady progress. Our first priority is to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. We've been rolling out ADP Assist these past couple of quarters, which as a reminder will be embedded in our key platforms and utilizes GenAI to surface insights, aid decision-making and streamline day-to-day tasks for our clients and their employees. In Q3, we were very excited to begin piloting a new feature that enables our small business clients to not only leverage GenAI to answer questions and better understand how to initiate an HR action which we outlined in recent quarters but to actually allow them to issue commands to complete that HR action. For example, users can now type I need to rehire Alex or I would like to give Alex a leave of absence and are expedited through that workflow. Our second priority is to provide unmatched expertise in outsourcing. We continue to extend GenAI capabilities to a broader portion of our service associates, and in Q3, we started rolling out a new tool for some of our implementation teams. Now they can use GenAI to take in unstructured client employee data reducing manual data entry and minimizing errors during the implementation process. While it's still early, we are excited about its potential benefits. Our third priority is to benefit our clients with our global scale. The ADP marketplace remains a differentiator for us and is a perfect example of a benefit our clients receive from partnering with the leader in HCM. As a growing number of our hundreds of partners offer AI-enabled solutions, in Q3, we established ADP marketplace AI principles that require our partners to commit for the same type of responsible AI principles that govern our own products including human oversight, monitoring, explainability and mitigating bias. Our clients put a huge amount of trust in us and this is another example of how ADP strives to ensure the responsible use of AI throughout the ADP ecosystem. We also continued to extend our market-leading global scale, and in Q3, we reached 1 million paid employees on our I-HCM platform, which continues to scale in several countries in Europe and we made further progress in growing our presence in the APAC region, where we have recently been expanding our in-country payroll and workforce management presence in a number of markets. In 2024, we are celebrating our 75th anniversary and we pride ourselves on having built ourselves into a brand that truly matters to employers, their employees and the broader world of work. Our focus on our strategic priorities positions us to deliver more value than ever for our over 1 million current clients and to the tens of thousands of new clients we welcome to the ADP family every quarter. I'd like to highlight just a few of these new client wins from Q3 to give you an appreciation for the variety of ways in which we deliver value for them. In U.S. small business, we had a new Boutique Donut Shop referred to us from one of our CPA partners. The client chose ADP for the strength of our run platform, our reputation for great service, our strong relationship with our CPA and our ability to provide retirement services. Since this was a first time small business owner, our sales team even took the time to help the business owner set up their business the right way from guiding the client on obtaining a state tax ID to making sure the client obtained the appropriate workers compensation insurance. In U.S. midmarket, we won a multistate operator of rehabilitation centers, this client wasn't happy with our prior HCM provider and Workforce Now proved a much better fit. What makes me the most proud in this example is how one of our ADP marketplace partners played a key role in the decision to switch to ADP by independently highlighting the advantages we offered in terms of ease of integrations, a capability we have invested in over the years. In U.S. enterprise, we welcomed a large luxury resort that operates multiple hotels, restaurants and retail stores on site and was dissatisfied with the prior provider's level of client service. The client was so happy following their seamless ADP implementation, which included onsite training for their HR team that they accelerated their plans to add-on features like benefits, recruiting, onboarding, wage garnishment and tax credits. In our International business, one recent win was a leading airline that utilized ADP in certain countries and asked us to help better define their global payroll strategy. Ultimately, they expanded the scope of our services to include in additional 18 countries and started that rollout in the third quarter with plans to add other countries over the next year to enable true consolidated global reporting and analytics. And as a final example, our HRO team started a New York-based design firm after its leadership team recognized the company lacked the HR infrastructure required to adequately attract and retain the right talent. They turned to our PEO offering for truly comprehensive support, attracted by the breadth of our offering including features like the MyLife Advisors program, which supports employees as they make benefit in other important life decisions. We also advise this client in the development of a comprehensive benefits strategy to support their multigenerational workforce and help them attract the talent that they need to grow. As you can tell from these examples, it's often a combination of our technology, expertise and overall breadth that resonated with these businesses, and the result is incredible diversity in our client base and a resilient overall business model. We look forward to leaning in and delivering even greater differentiation in the market going forward. Overall, we were pleased with the strong financial and strategic outcomes in the third quarter. I'd like to thank our associates who continued to deliver exceptional products and service to our clients, in whose efforts drive these client wins and retention. Thank you again for all you do for ADP and for our clients. And now, I'll turn it over to Don. Good morning. I was going to say good morning, Owen. How about I start and I'll let Don chime in. I think the comment would be, just to start, we are smack in the middle of our open enrollment season exactly as you suggested, and so, it's probably too early to make a call in terms of what that's going to look like from a full year perspective on the retention side. But overall, we have seen a bit, a tiny bit of PEO retention improvement this year and the compares are getting a bit easier and we do expect some improvement for the full year. So with that, I'll let Don chime in. Yes, absolutely. We're very pleased with the overall retention results. I think you see that in our revised outlook, you see that in the revision we made last quarter as well. And so, just to remind everybody just how well retention is going, fiscal '23 was a record, that record was really driven by the mid-market and international and the down market actually did decline a bit in fiscal '23 and we expect pretty much the same outlook, if you will, for full year '24, which is why we still have a down year-on-year retention result, but we're incredibly pleased with overall what we're seeing with client retention, that's really being led by a combination of things, one of which is the investments we made into product, the record results we have in terms of client satisfaction, that in and of itself was a record in the third quarter, along with retention. So, we're very, very pleased with that. As mentioned, there's still down market variability and there's down market out of business. We haven't seen it thus far this year but we still expect it to normalize a bit further. And then there's always normal variability in retention. So, we believe the retention guide is the appropriate one, but certainly we're very pleased with the record quarter and where we sit with retention thus far this year. Sure. So, first and foremost, we feel good about the overall demand environments. Companies are still hiring as we saw today and they're still investing as such in people, in HCM. The call outs, I made a few of them during the prepared remarks, but it's really -- the down market continues to impress us this quarter specifically in retirement services, so I'd make a call out there, it's quite fantastic to see that story and retirement services come together. We talked quite a bit about secular tailwinds in that space based on legislation that coupled with the investments we've been making, an incredible distribution execution, really great to see the retirement services leading the way. I think other areas that I would call out that have been remarkably strong is our mid-market as well as international. And so, again, similar story to retirement services, and that it's really a great story coming together between investments and execution, and enterprise also was strong for us for the quarter. And in terms of anything changing broad-based, we haven't really seen anything change in the demand environment. Quite candidly, we feel really strong as suggested by the overall hiring landscape and the labor demand. Good morning, Mark. I would say to you mid-market on both of those. So, mid-market is driving the strong NPS scores to record highs. The mid-market is driving incredible retention. So that's the one call out. You can probably hear the optimism in my voice there because it's a fantastic story coming together, but I think overall retention is incredibly strong. The mid-market international in fiscal '23 were very strong, they continue to be strong, but that's really the one call out I would make is the mid-market. Yes, absolutely, Mark. I'll give it a shot and certainly happy to have Don chime in. Maybe he can talk a little bit about our growth opportunity in international, but I think, broadly speaking, when you think about the total addressable market of the HCM space and where we all play and we all compete and it's highly competitive and there's been a lot of investments coming into the space over the past few years. What I would suggest is there's still tremendous amount of growth and growth upside for all of us, and as you mentioned, we continued to deliver that and the results that we see on the new business booking side. And so, I think overall there is still runway, there's still plenty of space. I think the part for us outside of our incredible distribution organization which has always been a competitive advantage in how we go to market, that distribution is also anchored to our ability to upsell to the base. So you mentioned this ability to upgrade and how much has upgraded and are we all the way there? What I would suggest to you is, we're still at about 50% as it relates to new business bookings coming from, call it, new business, net new business versus upgrades, which suggests to me that we still have a tremendous amount of opportunity even within our base. And that's a lot of the focus that we have as an organization, whether it's in the PEO getting smarter about which clients within employer services that we target to offer to the PEO or it's the work that we're doing on generative AI to try to get upsell and offering the right product to the right client at the right time. And in my mind, bending the curve and continuing to focus on attach rates whether that's on the point of sale or omni-attach at a later time is definitely an opportunity for us to continue to deliver bookings in a very broad market that still has a tremendous amount of opportunity for all of us, but moreover, where we continue to execute and deliver on that. So, I don't know, Don, if you want to comment a little bit on international in terms of the opportunity there? In terms of, from a standpoint of our price, or pricing in the market from a demand? Yes, absolutely. So I think my general sentiments, and then Don can give the kind of a little more directional, but my general sentiments around price remain that we're very thoughtful, and very measured as it relates to how we think about price, whether that's on the new business side, or it's on the renewal side, as you mentioned. And so for us, it's about understanding kind of by segment. So you heard my commentary in the prepared remarks, just how broad and deep and diverse ADP is, with respect to our client base. As you can imagine, we think about a down market, price increased differently than perhaps an enterprise. Some of those are also long-term contracts that have indexes attached. And so all of that lends itself to a very surgical approach, right? To ensure that the price value equation remains the right one, for the market and for our clients. And obviously at the same time, what we're doing is also monitoring what's happening in the HCM space with respect to the peer group and pricing overall. And I would say from a competitive lens, we haven't seen anything unusual as it relates to price from us or the others, even though it continues to be a highly competitive environment. And so as such, our approach this year to price, which I'll let Don comment on, has been very thoughtful and I would expect us to take that same measured approach as we had into '25. Oh. The answer is both. So I think it's really about solving for, again, all of the users that interact with ADP, right? So if you think about all the personas, our clients, our clients' employees, and our service agents, our sellers, it's really about putting GenAI in every part of our ecosystem. So in terms of what are we solving for, the answer is both. We're trying to drive greater service efficiency. I think, we've proven out that through digital transformation and taking friction out of our products and making those investments, we have the ability to drive up our NPS results and record client satisfaction tends to lead to similar record retention. So definitely working on ensuring that we're driving up retention. Obviously, the more happy clients we have, the easier it is for our sellers. We're also investing into generative AI for our sellers, to become more productive. So it is about service productivity. It's about seller productivity. It's about client experience. Client experience lends itself to retention. So I guess it's just one happy virtuous cycle, but I think - my answer is both, and all of it is what we hope to gain. Now, again, kind of back to the investments we're making and what Don alluded to in terms of any pressure we would have with respect to margin on those investments. Some of these investments, we know they're the right thing for ADP, but they will take time to ultimately garner all of the results, in all of these categories that I just mentioned. And so, as it stands today, we have some really exciting things that we're seeing. If you think about something, like call summarization that I've spoken about in the past. And we're shaving off roughly a minute per call, that doesn't probably sound that exciting. But you think about a minute per call over time, and you think about how many calls we take broadly across ADP in a given year. The math lends itself to over time, tremendous efficiency, and again, hopefully a better experience, right? So I think the answer is all of it. We're solving for all of it. Yes, thanks, Pete. I think that was a solid like three, four questions in one. So I will, I'll do my best to weave through it here. But as Don mentioned, we're on the ground in 40 countries. We do payroll across 140 countries, inclusive of our partner network. In terms of the final mile or the last mile, as you referenced, the first thing I would comment on is we've building that 50 years. So when I think about international and everything we've done over the course of decades to build that infrastructure, it's a tremendous lead is what I would suggest. And you see that in our international bookings results, right? So we had a nice first quarter in international. We accelerated that in the second quarter. We had an even better Q3. A lot of that is being driven by our multinational growth. So think about our Celergo offering, our GlobalView offering. These were especially strong for us in the third quarter. And I do believe it's the overall demand environment coupled with - on the ground strategy, if you will, if you will. And by the way, the international pipelines remain healthy. And we believe it's going to position us for a solid Q4, but also next year. In terms of, where we continue to expand. I mentioned it in my prepared remarks. Asia-Pac or APAC is something that, our Asia business has been relatively modest, but we see significant growth over time. Obviously, that growth is a direct byproduct of our clients demand growth, as it relates to the activities of our clients and where they're moving associates, and where they're moving business. So, we believe that continuing to lean into Asia-Pac is important for us. And so as a result of that, we kind of are continuing to lean in there. I think we mentioned last quarter, the acquisition of a company in the Nordics, specifically in Sweden. So that's an area that also is a high growth area from a client perspective. And so I think, our strategy over time has been as we get further into a country and we see the demand, at times we will fold in our partners. And you've seen that obviously in the Nordics, and you've seen that in many countries prior to that. But that ecosystem is vast across 140 countries. Its decades of building that final mile. It's a clear competitive differentiator in the market. You can feel see and it's really palpable on the heels of the last earnings call. I was actually over at our rethink event, which is where we bring together a few hundred of our very largest global MNC clients. And the spirit of how we're executing in that market is really palpable, when you hear it directly from our clients. And I believe it's a tremendous opportunity for us to continue to drive growth. So I think, I covered all of that, Pete. Yes, of course. So next-gen payroll, for sure, our intent is to continue to drive next-gen payroll, across various international markets. We have it deployed in a few of our markets today. And that coupled with these offers that again have the lead of Celergo going GlobalView over time, will just further the growth narrative and the story over there. But that is absolutely the intention and the strategic direction of next-gen payroll. Yes, absolutely. So the mid-market is a great segment for us. It's certainly not getting any easier to be an employer in the mid-market. It's littered with complexity and all sorts of challenges to navigate, just even if you look at the last 30 days, you can see legislation that mid-market employers are having to navigate. And so it's a strong market. It is a highly competitive space. That's not new. I think for - from a competitive landscape perspective, it's always been competitive. And I don't know that we've seen a noticeable changes in the competitive landscape. What we have seen is incredible distribution, execution, incredible satisfaction, execution on our end. We've made great investments into the product set. It's winning in the market. You marry that strategy with great execution on the seller side and great execution on the retention side. That, to me, is what's changing in the mid-market is that we've gotten stronger. Everywhere. Candidly, listen, from a mid-market perspective, again, the demand is healthy. The competitive environment is competitive, and we continue to remain laser-focused on all of the competitors specifically. The ones that have been talking a lot about us over the last few years. And I think the way that we've been focused is really about the investments we've made, investments into a best-in-class product. Investments into focus on distribution investments into a digital transformation that's driving great client satisfaction. And so, that really has allowed us to have a winning story, as it relates to really all of the players. Yes. So I'm happy to start and certainly happy to have Don chime in too on the PEO. I'm always very, very bullish on the PEO value proposition. I've been close to that business for a long time, and I will tell you it's stronger than it's ever been. So despite the strangeness that we've had in the PEO, from a kind of the componentry heading into the pandemic, during the pandemic after the pandemic and then now, call it, a little bit post, post pandemic. What I would suggest to you is it has nothing to do with the fundamentals of that business, and what we would expect over time from a growth perspective long-term. And so the value proposition is strong. Nothing from our end has changed there, as it relates to the overall demand from the business. And we see that just in the - we continue to have 50% of our clients into the PEO coming from the base. So it's resonating with our existing clients. It's resonating with the open market, and it continues to be a very strong offering for us. So I don't know, Don, if you want to add anything there? Yes. Thank you, and thank you once again to everyone who joined us today, whether the full time or late. We always appreciate the questions, the interest, and we certainly look forward to speaking with all of you again soon, and look forward to the close of the year. Thanks."

            "name": "Don McGuire",
            "content": "Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide more color on our results for the quarter and our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. Overall, we reported a strong third quarter with our consolidated revenue growth and our adjusted EBIT margin coming in a bit above our expectations. The interest rate backdrop has improved since we last provided our full year outlook, so we are updating our outlook for that as well as making a few other changes, which I'll detail. I'll start with Employer Services. ES segment revenue grew 8% on a reported basis and 7% on an organic constant currency basis. As Maria shared, we had a good quarter in ES new business bookings with broad-based growth across our client segments. We have a tough compare in Q4 following last year's strong finish but with a steady HCM demand environment and healthy pipelines, we feel on track to deliver our 4% to 7% new business bookings growth outlook for the year. Also, as Maria mentioned earlier, our ES retention exceeded our expectations and increased slightly from last year. Given our continued strong retention performance, we are increasing our full-year retention outlook slightly, we now anticipate a 20 to 30 basis point decline in full year retention which is better than our prior forecast. ES pays per control growth held steady at 2% in Q3 and we now expect growth to round to 2% for the year, the high end of our prior 1% to 2% growth outlook, and client funds interest revenue exceed our expectations in Q3 due to higher average client funds balances and a slightly better average yield. We are revising our full-year client funds interest outlook to reflect our Q3 results and the increase in prevailing interest rates since our last update. We now expect fiscal '24 average client funds balance growth of about 3% and we are raising our expectations for client fund's interest revenue and net impact from our client fund's extended investment strategy. In total, there is no change to our fiscal '24 ES revenue growth forecast of 7% to 8%, although we are now likely to come in towards the higher end of that range. Our ES margin increased 230 basis points in Q3, driven both by operating leverage and the contribution from client funds interest revenue growth. With our strong Q3 results and the slightly more favorable client funds interest rate backdrop, we are raising our fiscal '24 ES margin outlook and now anticipate growth of 180 to 190 basis points. Moving onto the PEO. We had 5% revenue growth driven by 3% growth in average work site employees in the third quarter, representing slight acceleration from the first half of the year. These results were largely in line with our expectations and we were encouraged by the gradual stabilization in our PEO's pays per control growth which decelerated but only slightly from the prior quarter. We continued to anticipate soft pays per control growth through the end of the year and expect work-site employee growth to hold steady at about 3% keeping us on track for our full-year outlook for work-site employee growth of 2% to 3% and revenue growth of 3% to 4%. PEO margin decreased 220 basis points in Q3. As we shared last quarter, we expect this year's workers' compensation reserve release benefit to be significantly lower than what we experienced these last few years, and in particular, last year's $73 million benefit. We are updating our fiscal '24 outlook to now assume a minimal release benefit, and as a result, we are further revising our overall PEO margin expectation to be down 120 to 140 basis points in fiscal '24 versus our prior expectation for a decline of 80 to 100 basis points. Putting it all together, there is no change to our fiscal '24 consolidated revenue growth of 6% to 7%. With the two changes to segment margins, largely offsetting one another, we continue to expect our adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 60 to 70 basis points. We still anticipate an effective tax rate of around 23% and we continue to expect fiscal '24 adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12% with the middle of that range still the most likely outcome. As we look ahead to fiscal '25, I wanted to share a couple of early thoughts at this point. First, give them the fullness of the labor market, we are planning for pays per control growth to once again be below normal levels next year and to decelerate modestly from this year's growth level in both ES and our PEO segments with the resulting revenue pressure more apparent in the PEO segment given its more direct revenue sensitivity to work-site employees. We will of course share those exact assumptions with you when we give our formal guidance in a few months. On the expense side, we are also planning to continue growing our GenAI related spend next year. As you've heard from us all year long, there are many ways we can put GenAI in the hands of all of the different stakeholders that work with or on behalf of ADP, including our client practitioners, their employees, our service and implementation teams, our sellers and our developers. These are critical investments and they are the right investments for ADP, but we expect the associated benefits and productivity of growth to phasing gradually over time likely representing overall margin pressure for the year. At the same time, we appear positioned for continued tailwind from interest rates, though the extent of this benefit will of course depend on how the yield curve continues to develop. As usual, we're focused primarily on maintaining good momentum in our new business bookings and maintaining our strong client satisfaction and retention and we remain upbeat about our strategy for the years ahead. And now over to Q&A. Sorry, I jumped again there. So, Maria, thank you. Perfect answer. Thank you. Yes, so a couple of things, Zack. Maria already mentioned that retention is in very good shape for us, so certainly that's been helping and contributing to the revenue growth. And of course what's changed since last time around which is making us even more comfortable with saying we're going to be towards the higher end of the range is that client funds interest impact is very good. So, I think those are the two primary drivers to why we're more confident that we're going to see revenue come in towards the higher end of the seven to eight than we perhaps worth 90 days ago. Yes, perhaps to add a little bit more color, I think we're very still very optimistic about growth opportunities beyond the U.S. or the North American market. So, Mark, I think we've talked before we're on the ground in 40 plus countries outside of the U.S. We're present in multiple segments in those markets as well. We've got some great things happening in Southeast Asia where we're rolling out a single platform across beginning in India but many countries surrounding India and the Southeast Asian market. We're excited, we often talk about the fact that we pay over a million people in India, every payroll, every payday. Price points are still a bit low, but we expect those things to work for us and work in our favor in the future. So, I think still lots and lots of opportunity for ADP from a growth perspective and certainly we don't worry about saturation being a limiter to our future. Yes, Scott, thanks for the question. I think it's still early. I think the intent here was to give some very early guidance on what '25 could look like. So, we still expect to see some improvements in margins. It's just, do we expect to see as much of an improvement given some of the GenAI pressures, expense pressures that we may see. Of course, CFI, at this point in time, depending what the yield curve does, once again things have changed a fair bit in the last 90 days, and if I was to, not that I have a crystal ball, but I don't think many folks right now are expecting anything to change from the rates perspective in the U.S. before September, so I think we're going to get some tailwinds from that. So, we're not really trying to signal here -- not signaling a decline in our margins, what we're signaling perhaps is perhaps a slower growth in the margins as we look into '25. Sure, so if I, you know, Maria talked a little bit about bookings, I think, so we've been, we were happy with our bookings. They softened a little bit in Q3, but we had a very, very strong Q2 on PEO bookings. We can move on kind of to the PPC growth. Back in Q1, it decelerated a little bit more than we anticipated, and a significant amount of that deceleration was attributed to the technology and professional services sector. And in Q2, that stabilized. So that was good for us. While there's still some headwinds in PPC, including from technology and service sectors, there were no surprises in Q3. So it's important to note that worksite employee growth accelerated, about 1% over Q2, despite the modest incremental pressure we had from PPC pressure. And so, and that, of course, is a function of the year-to-date booking success that we've had. So nothing really to call out. More stability, if you will, in PPC pressure than we've talked about previously. Yes, so the price increase this year was relatively well-received. We're in the 100, 150 basis point range. We're closer to the 150. So happy with where we're at. But back to Maria's comments, we're in the middle of our planning cycle right now, and we'll look very carefully at that whole value equation, making sure that we keep our retention up. Our NPS is supporting that, and we'll make sure that we're mindful and thoughtful about what we do with pricing going forward. Yes, Michael, thanks for the question. I think that, first of all, the price, there's no change in that. I think we've been calling that out for most of the year, certainly in the one to 150 range. So not much of an incremental impact, if you will, for Q4 and therefore for the year in total. So not a lot of change from that. Yes, I mean, bookings, we called out, we're still in the hunt for delivering on the range as we declared, so we're still in that so. But not really a lot to drive incremental revenue, other than some of the float, but as the year shortens or we have fewer months, days left in the year, the impact from higher CFI is going to be somewhat muted as we look to finish the year. Caroline, thanks for the question. I think it just comes - continues to come back to the same concepts, and that's making sure that we offer good value to our customers over a 10-plus year lifespan. So, we're always mindful of making sure that clients are getting good value, and that we keep those clients for a very, very long time. So it's that client life cycle of the total return on the entire life of a client. So, we're always very, very careful not to overstep on pricing. Having said that, we, of course, watch what the competition is doing. We have our ear to the ground. Our salespeople have their ear to the ground. We're trying to make sure and understand what's happening from the competition. So, we will continue to look at it. We'll continue to knock around some ideas, and some models and see what the impact could be. But I don't want to signal exactly what we think we're doing, because we're still, as I said earlier, in the midst of our planning cycle here. But we always look at it. We take price usually every year where we can, not including some of the contractual commitments we have with some of our larger clients, but just something we're very, very careful and cautious about doing shots a lot of color. Nothing to add then the value proposition is as strong as ever, and the fundamentals in the business are continue to be quite strong. Yes. Dan, just a couple of things, thinking about next year. We do think that it's early, so we didn't share too much, although we did say that the pace per control will continue to be under a little bit of pressure, given the fullness of the labor market. So that's kind of continuing story that we've been telling. We will continue some of our GenAI spending related spending, making the right investments for ADP. And of course, we're going to get some tailwind from interest rates. So I think those are the three primary things. And of course, we always remain very, very focused on bookings and our strong client retention and client experience. So, I think those would be the highlights for '25."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time.  I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danny Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanny Hussain: Thank you, Michelle, and welcome, everyone, to ADP's second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO, and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I'll now turn it over to Maria.\nMaria Black: Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. This morning, we reported strong second quarter results, including 6% revenue growth and 9% adjusted EPS growth. I'll begin with a review of the quarter's financial highlights, before providing an update on the progress we are making across our strategic priorities. We delivered solid Employer Services new business bookings in the second quarter, reaching a new record bookings volume for Q2, and keeping us on track for our full-year outlook. Growth was especially robust across our small business portfolio, and we also experience healthy growth in our mid-market and international business. With steady demand in HCM and a healthy new business pipeline at the end of the quarter, we look forward to the important selling season ahead. Employer Services retention was strong in the second quarter. Although it declined slightly compared to the prior year, we once again exceeded our expectations as we continue to benefit from a healthy overall business environment, and from our very high client satisfaction levels. Our Employer Services pays per control growth remained at 2% for the second quarter. The overall labor market remains resilient, and our clients continue to add employees at a moderate pace, which is resulting in a very gradual deceleration and pays per control growth. And last, our PEO revenue growth of 3% for the second quarter, was in line with our expectations, and we are very pleased to have delivered strong PEO new business bookings that were ahead of our expectations. Based on continued healthy activity levels, we feel good about our PEO bookings momentum, and we look forward to seeing a gradual re-acceleration of our PEO business in the second half of this fiscal year.  Moving on to a broader update. During the second quarter, we launched a new brand advertising campaign themed, the next anything. The campaign highlights how the world of work is always changing, sometimes gradually, sometimes suddenly, and trusted business solutions must evolve with it. The theme aligns with our strategic priorities to give our clients the advantage of our leading technology, expertise, and scale. In Q2, we continue to push forward on our first strategic priority to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. A key part of that is the rollout of ADP Assist, our cross-platform solution powered by GenAI that proactively delivers actionable insights in plain language to enhance HR productivity, aid decision-making, and streamline day-to-day tasks for our clients and their employees. ADP Assist seamlessly integrates with ADP products across multiple platforms. Using an intuitive conversational interface, it provides valuable and contextual insights which touch every aspect of HR. For example, in addition to the features we shared with you last quarter, including our natural language reporting capability, in Q2, we integrated natural language search capabilities into our run platform, which allows it to understand intent behind the search terms and use GenAI to mine ADP's deep knowledge base to deliver easy to use and effective content. ADP Assist also helps clients validate payrolls and solve common employee challenges across HR, payroll, time, and benefits. It's a comprehensive experience that is trained on the industry's largest and deepest HCM dataset and our deep knowledge base to surface highly credible and actionable insights so that clients can make smarter decisions.  We are excited about the roadmap ahead for all of our major solutions, and we expect it to help us build on the recognition we continue to earn in the market. In Q2 alone, we were pleased to be recognized for product leadership by three major industry analyst rankings. Everest Group named ADP the highest leader out of 27 providers in its multi-country payroll solutions PEAK Matrix report. NelsonHall identified ADP as a leader in its Payroll Services Vendor Evaluation and Assessment tool in all markets. And Ventana Research named us an exemplary leader across its North American, global, and payroll management buyers guide for performing the best and meeting overall product and customer experience requirements. Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing solutions. We shared last quarter that we were beginning to equip our associates with GenAI capabilities through our Agent Assist technology. In Q2, we expanded our call summarization deployment to a greater portion of our service associates and started to see productivity gains with shorter handle time and improved service quality. With our global service associates fielding millions of calls annually, we are incredibly excited to test ways to optimize those client interactions.  Our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients through our global scale, and we continue to lean into this advantage. In Q2, we announced a strategic collaboration with Convera, a global business to business payments company to help our multi-country clients manage the complexity of global payroll and cross-border payments through an integrated platform. By combining Convera\u2019s payment solutions with our global payroll expertise, we're enhancing the client experience by minimizing the need to access various banking platforms and improving payment accuracy, compliance, and security. We also announced the launch of ADP retirement trust services to support our growing retirement services business. Standing up our own trust services entity demonstrates our scale and commitment to our retirement clients, positioning us on par with financial industry leaders and ahead of HCM competitors that rely on third parties. This commitment can really matter to financial advisors, keeps data within ADP's trusted ecosystem, and provides a cost and price benefit to ADP and our clients over the long term. Our scale also affords us the opportunity to partner with other leading technology providers in innovative ways, and we continue to expand on many of those partnerships to provide our sales implementation and service teams with client-specific insights to quickly address market shifts, drive more personalized interactions, and deepen our overall client engagement.  Overall, our second quarter represented strong outcomes on the financial front and with respect to our key strategic priorities. I'd like to thank our associates who continue to deliver exceptional products and outstanding service to our clients, particularly now, as many of them are in the middle of our most hectic time of year completing year-end work. I'm proud to share that their efforts help drive our overall Net Promoter Score to its highest level ever in the second quarter. Thank you again for all that you do for ADP and for our clients. And now, I'll turn it over to Don.\nDon McGuire: Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide more color on our results for the quarter, as well as our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. Overall, we reported a strong second quarter, with our consolidated revenue growth moderating in line with our expectations, and our adjusted EBIT margin coming in slightly better than expected. However, the interest rate backdrop has changed since we last provided our full-year outlook, and we are lightly tweaking our outlook, which I'll detail. I'll start with Employer Services. ES segment revenue increased 8% on a reported basis, and 7% on an organic constant currency basis, coming in slightly ahead of our expectations. As Maria shared, we continue to grow our ES new business bookings, resulting in a record second quarter bookings volume. Our small business portfolio and international business provided outsized growth contributions this quarter. And with a steady HCM demand environment and healthy pipelines, we feel on track for our 4% to 7% new business bookings growth outlook for the year. As mentioned earlier, our ES retention declined slightly in Q2 versus the prior year, but again exceeded our expectations. Given our first half retention outperformance, we are increasing our full-year retention outlook slightly. We now anticipate a 40 to 60 basis point decline in our full-year retention, which is 10 basis points better than our prior forecast.  ES pays per control growth of 2% in Q2, was in line with our expectations, and we are maintaining our 1% to 2% growth outlook for the full-year. And client funds interest revenue increased in line with our expectations in Q2, as a slight decline in our average client funds balance, which we discussed last quarter, was more than offset by an increase in our average yield. However, we are revising our full-year client funds interest outlook lower to reflect the change in prevailing interest rates since our last update. We now expect fiscal 2024 client funds interest revenue of $985 million to $995 million, and we expect a net impact from our client funds extended investment strategy of $835 million to $845 million, representing a reduction of about $20 million at the midpoint. In total, there is no change to our fiscal 2024 ES revenue growth forecast of 7% to 8%. Our ES margin increased 170 basis points in Q2, driven by both operating leverage and contribution from client funds interest revenue growth, but reflecting the impact of a reduced client funds interest revenue forecast, as well as a slight increase in expected GenAI related spend, we are tweaking our fiscal 2024 ES margin outlook and now anticipate the lower end of our prior margin range. Moving on to the PEO, we had 3% revenue growth, driven by 2% growth in average work site employees in the second quarter. These metrics were in line with expectation, and we are encouraged to see signs of stabilization in our PEO pays per control growth. As Maria mentioned, our PEO new business bookings were very strong in Q2. With continued healthy activity levels, we continue to anticipate a gradual ramp in our work site employee growth in the back half of fiscal 2024, and we are maintaining our full-year growth outlook of 2% to 3%. PEO margin decreased 50 basis points in Q2. As we shared last quarter, we assume this year's workers' compensation reserve release benefit will be lower than last year's benefit, and we are further narrowing our PEO margin expectation to be down 80 to 100 basis points in fiscal 2024 versus our prior expectation of decline of 50 to 100 basis points.  Putting it all together, there is no change to our fiscal 2024 consolidated revenue growth outlook of 6% to 7%. With the two changes to segment margin, we now expect our adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 60 to 70 basis points versus our prior outlook, for an increase of 60 to 80 basis points. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of around 23%, and we still anticipate fiscal 2024 adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12%, with the middle of that range the most likely outcome given current assumptions.  Thank you, and I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Hey, good morning, and congratulations on all the accolades that you've gotten from the third-party reviewers. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about some of the initiatives. And specifically, one that stood out was the - was setting up your own trust. Can you talk a little bit about the investment there and how we should think about how that would end up unfolding? And what do you think some of the reactions would be with some of your third-party partners? Like, you've got bank partnerships and CPA partnerships and obviously benefit administration partnerships. How do you think they'll end up reacting? Thank you, Maria.\nMaria Black: Thank you, Mark, and good morning. Appreciate the question and appreciate your well wishes on all of our recognition. Certainly excited to see across the board the recognition we mentioned during the prepared remarks, but also the continued momentum across all of our initiatives. Happy to comment on retirement trust services. It is really a demonstration of our scale. And so, when I think about what it means to our clients, what it means to the ecosystem that you mentioned, banks, CPAs, I think it's all incredibly positive. And trust services are a core component of any 401(k) plan. Given the size and scale of our retirement services business, what we found is that the pool of what's known as third-party trustees, if you will, that are capable of handling a business just of our size, is actually becoming shrinkingly more difficult, if you will, in terms of the number of providers that are able to offer standalone trust services to a retirement offering of our size. So, in terms of that, we made the decision to launch our in-house trust services. We believe that this is a great value to our clients, to the ecosystem. It puts us on par with other industry leaders and the financial services, and really a competitive advantage against some of our HCM competitors that continue to leverage these third-party trustees. So, for us, I think it's a big commitment to the business that we have, the retirement business that is, which really can matter to financial advisors, and as you said, CPAs and banks. Really by taking the trust services in-house, the implication is that we have better control over our costs. Ultimately, that yields a better price for our clients, a better service. We also have the ability to maintain all of the data inside of ADP's ecosystem, which as you know, is a big component of who ADP is in terms of data integrity and all those things. So, that's kind of the retirement trust services in a nutshell, Mark.\nMark Marcon: Terrific. thanks for that. And then just, it was noticeable that you basically are anticipating a lower level of decline in terms of the ES retention, which is coming off of record levels. To what extent is that due to an anticipation of lower levels of bankruptcies as opposed to just the improvement that you've been seeing in terms of your client service scores?\nMaria Black: So, retention is going incredibly well, right? And we mentioned that in the remarks. Year-to-date retention has definitely been better than we expected. And so, I think things are fundamentally really healthy right now. One thing to keep in mind as kind of think about the outlook, is that we are, as you mentioned, we are coming off of some of the record highs that we've seen over the last several years. And while we believe that from specifically a down market perspective, we're close to being normalized back to fiscal 2019 trends, we do also anticipate some pressure in the back half from perhaps out of business and bankruptcies having more of a material impact. We haven't seen it to date, but we certainly want to ensure that we're cognizant of the fact and we believe it's prudent - given that we have retention running at such record levels, we believe it's prudent to plan for it in the back half to have some pressure. And obviously, just like any year, Mark, retention is always noisy until we have some normal variability and conservatism in the back half. Just like you, I'd like to think that there's opportunity there. I think only time will give us the answer to that, but that's kind of how we're thinking about the back half.\nMark Marcon: Really appreciate that, Maria. Thank you, and congratulations.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate all the detail this morning. I wanted to quickly just touch on PEO. You called out a strong acceleration in the business, but it looks like outlook for revenues was changed - you may have mentioned that, but I'm just trying to capture how much of that is timing issue versus the concentration you have in professional services and technology, which still seem a little bit soft, at least in the employment reports.\nDon McGuire: Yes, James, thanks for that question. We've been happy to see the stabilization in the pays per control in those sectors, the financial services and technology sector. So, although there's still a little bit of noise there, it's certainly stabilized from what we saw in the prior quarter. So, that's positive. I do think that as we looked at our sales results, our bookings for PEO, we were very happy with the bookings. Maria mentioned that already very good. I think as we kind of put those together, the improvement in the pays per control and the improvement in our bookings, I think we're going to be heading towards that re-acceleration that we've been pointing to over the last couple of quarters in the PEO. But really just trying to get the impact of those two components, those variables, is really what's going to help us get that re-acceleration going.\nDanny Hussain: And James, just to clarify, the pays per control, although it\u2019s stabilizing, it's not providing any sort of upside versus our prior forecast. So, bookings are going well. It takes a quite a bit in terms of bookings to really drive a material change to the current year revenue, which you well understand. With pays per control still providing sequential, gradual drag, those two are sort of netting out to an inline outlook.\nJames Faucette: Got it. Thanks for that, Danny. And then quickly on AI, it seems like there's a little bit of incremental investment there and certainly a big focus on this call, but wondering about how we should think about the - how you're anticipating a return on that investment and over what kind of timeframe. And maybe more qualitatively, what kinds of paybacks, whether it's increased customer satisfaction or internal operations, et cetera. Thanks.\nMaria Black: Yes, so I'll start on the on the AI side and tell you all the reasons again that I'm so excited about it. Maybe Don can give you a little bit about how we're thinking about the return on investments that we're making. So, just to remind everyone how we're thinking about AI, in its most simplistic way, I think about it really in three buckets, the first of which is product and innovation. So, putting generative AI into all of our innovation cycles. So, that's everything from product development to the features and functionality that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And by the way, later this morning, we're actually issuing a press release that goes through some of our product and innovation, call it, philosophy and launches of products, right? So, some of what this press release speaks to is how we're thinking about and our design principles around making things easy, smart, and human within our product and innovation cycles to really drive things like payroll assist, things like ADP Assist into the market in a meaningful way. So, product is really kind of the first bucket. And as you'll see, we're making significant investments there. We do have ADP Assist now more broadly deployed across the product set, and we're seeing meaningful impact as it relates to our client experience on that. The second bucket is what I call efficiency and service efficiency. And this is really about giving all the same things that we're looking to give our clients to make their jobs easier and more effective and efficient, and giving those same tools to our associates. And so, we have Agent Assist. I'm pleased to say that from an Agent Assist perspective, we've more than doubled the number of associates today that are engaging in AI tools overall. Specifically, a big piece of that is anchored in Agent Assist and the things we're doing around call summarization. Again, I'll let Don comment on investments and return, but just to kind of give you a flavor of what we're talking about here, the feedback we're getting from our associates is, there are times we're shaving off a minute or two minutes by aiding things like call summarization. And while that probably seems minuscule, what I would offer to you is we have thousands of service associates, and we also have millions and millions of calls that we take every single year. And so, we're pretty optimistic and excited about a minute here and a minute there, and what that means from an incremental opportunity for us over time, right? So, we continue to lean into our service efficiency and really getting all of our associates more effective as it relates to their ability to engage with our clients. And then last but not least - by the way, I could go on and on and on all day on this topic, but last but not least and very, very important is how we're thinking about generative AI in our go-to market motions. And so, we have for years been at the tip of the spear of sales modernization. We have partnerships that are two decades old where we've always been leading the way with what it looks like to have a best-in-class modern distribution and sales force, and this is no different for us. So, we already have a broad set of our sellers leveraging tools along the lines of Generative AI, many of which are through our best-in-class vendors and partners that we have, and we're seeing great impact there. Things that I used to do myself at a personal level manually, such as pre-call planning, by the way, things like call summarization for prospecting, these are big items for us as it relates to our go-to-market motions, and we've just started scratching the surface. So, all in, really excited again. Just to kind of wrap it all up, I think it's about product, service efficiency, and our go-to-market motions. We are making active investments. Some of those investments are things that we've shifted that we were already working on in digital transformation. Some of it is incremental investments. And so, I think with that, I'll turn it over to Don who can kind of talk about how we're thinking about our incremental investments and moreover the return on that.\nDon McGuire: Yes, so I think Maria just outlined some of the exciting areas that GenAI will have for us and some of the things that'll change, how they'll make the client experience better, how they'll help our associates, how they'll help us sell more, et cetera. But I would say at this point in time, what we're really talking about is some modest investments in GenAI. I think it's going to be a little while before we start to see returns from those things, but we certainly do anticipate returns. But in the near term right now, it's really a time for investing in these tools, et cetera, and we'll see those outcomes, those financial outcomes somewhere down the road.\nJames Faucette: That's great. Thank you both very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi there, and thanks for taking my question this morning. You guys called out higher seller expenses as just one component of the margin headwinds in PEO. I guess the question, is this just the cost to compete in PEO at this point? In other words, is it becoming more expensive to compete in PEO, or do you expect expense levels related to selling to sort of abate in a more normalized time period?\nDon McGuire: Yes, I don't think there's - just to answer the question, there's nothing really unusual or fundamentally different about our selling expenses and how we go-to-market in the PEO. I think certainly as we see higher sales, as you know, we get a lot of our sales, half of our sales, give or take, from internal. So, some of that's a little bit of our internal housekeeping if you will, how we allocate expenses between business units, et cetera. But higher sales generally translate into higher selling expenses. So, really nothing fundamentally different in how we go-to-market. Certainly, not seeing any fundamental differences in the competitive landscape that's driving those expenses.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. Okay. And then one follow-up for me. In the context of the international product launches like Roll in Ireland, and also I guess the partnership you guys just announced with Convera, can you comment on the international value proposition itself, whether it's sort of largely the same as it is in the US, or are there distinctive products, needs, partnerships required in these markets that you guys sort of still need to build out to more fully execute on the international opportunity?\nDon McGuire: Yes, I'll start, and Maria can add here in a second. So, as you know, you look at our revenue as - international revenue as a percentage the total, and it\u2019s not where we'd like it to be, even though roughly 40% of the people we bear around world are in international. So, and the reason for that is that we have fundamentally different offers in the US. We have things like PEO. We also have money movement services, tax services, pretty much broadly distributed. Some of those offers don't have the same value proposition outside of the US market. So, our opportunity there is not quite the same. Perhaps it will be as time goes on, some of those services may be available in other markets, but as we speak today, they're not there. The value prop isn't the same. With respect to Convera as a partner, just to speak to that one a little bit, we have thousands of clients, and those thousands of clients have thousands of entities spread across multiple countries around the world. And if you think about the complexity and the difficulty of paying their people in some of these small countries and then getting the payments to the various social security providers in those countries, having somebody like Convera who can help a large European or a large US multinational manage the treasury function in those small countries around the world without having to set up all the banking, et cetera. So, someone like Convera acts as a great partner for us to facilitate those cross-border payments in a very - in a compliant way, et cetera. So, I think that's very positive for us. So, we do have some partners in international like Convera as I just mentioned, but we still see it as a great opportunity for us to continue to grow.\nMaria Black: That's right. If I may, one of the things, I think what Don is suggesting is really the opportunity we have with international. And so, when you put it in the context of the business that we have in the US there, there is a tremendous opportunity for us to think more broadly in international partnerships as the one Don just outlined with Convera, is a big piece of that. What I would also add is that from an international perspective, we did call out the performance specifically in Q2 on international. That's, by the way, bookings. That's on the heels of a solid Q1. What I would offer as well, we have record retention. We have record customer experience and client experience in international. So, I think we have a tremendous value proposition in international. By the way, some of the recognition I cited during the prepared remarks is really about how best-in-class our offer is with respect to the international offering we have. So, that said, as Don mentioned, we're not satisfied. I think there's more opportunity to us to scale and grow our beyond payroll offerings, partnerships that are a big piece of that, but undoubtedly, we're performing and competing very, very well internationally.\nRamsey El-Assal: Fantastic. Sounds like good things ahead. Appreciate it.\nMaria Black: Oh, you know what, let me just comment because you mentioned Roll in international, so I just thought I'd mention that really quickly, which is, we are very excited about the down market in international. Roll is one way that we're getting after that. And the pilot programs that we're running are teaching us a lot as we think about the down market and international.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi guys, congrats on the solid results. Don, I just wanted to ask about average balances. I know we were expecting a little bit of a headwind from the payroll tax deferral. Maybe you can quantify that as part of the reason for the drop of balances down 2%. And then what's the go forward there we should expect? Is there a more of a headwind from the payroll tax deferral for balances and maybe expect a similar decline in the back half of this year?\nDon McGuire: No, I think you were right to call out the payroll deferral, payroll tax deferral. That definitely was behind the decline quarter-to-quarter. We don't - that's now behind us. So, that's not going to be there. So, we are expecting 2% to 3% balanced growth throughout the balance of the year. So, we think that's very positive. I think the big callout though on the whole CFI program is just the fact that since we spoke last, five-year and 10-year interest rates are down about 80 bps on both of those. And so, I think that's a little bit of the headwind and that's roughly the $20 million or so that we're calling down the float number for the balance of the year. But still very optimistic about growth. Certainly, the reason that it's not growing as quickly perhaps as it did last year, we've certainly seen some moderation in wage growth, and we've talked about even though pays per control are behaving as we expected, they are certainly lower - pays per control growth is lower than it was in the back half, but will be lower in the back half of this year than it was in the back half of last year. So, those would be the major influencers, if you will, to the full balance as we go forward to the back half.\nBryan Keane: Got it. And is that part of the moving of the ES margins to the lower end of kind of the range you talked about? I think you talked about rates there. Just what was the surprise from three months ago on rates that that maybe caused you to push the margins towards the lower end or where you think the lower end, the new margin range? \nDon McGuire: Yes, so, you're right. I think the float certainly is a component of us guiding to the middle of our range, for sure. So, that's a component. We don't try to second guess the markets. We use yield curves that are out there in the market to estimate what we think our returns are going to be. So, no real surprises, other than seeing what's happening in the overall market. And then we're taking the forward yield curves and applying those to our balances, and that's where we land.\nBryan Keane: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Wurtzel: Great, thanks. Good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. Maybe just wanted to start off on some trends that we've seen so far in the selling season. Seems like through 2Q it was pretty positive on the booking side, but maybe wondering how we've sort of tracked into 3Q, and then also what you've seen maybe from competitors, any changes in pricing, go-to-market strategy and all that would be helpful.\nMaria Black: Yes, good morning, Scott. We feel good about the demand environment overall at this point. I think companies are still hiring. We saw that this morning actually as well. And companies are still investing in their people, their talent. They're investing in HR. I think there are a couple things I'd highlight to you. The down market, definitely companies are continuing to hire and they're continuing to buy. We had tremendous second quarter results. By the way, that business has been executing incredibly well really for many, many quarters. And that's our run offering, but it's also all the things that are attached to run. So, think insurance services, retirement services. All of the down market is doing incredibly well. To give you a little bit of a line of sight, because it is the 31st of January, so we do actually have a tiny bit of visibility specifically to the down market. And you asked about trends into the third quarter. What I would offer to you is January looks good. I think we're actually on track to onboard something close to like 30,000 units in that business alone in the month of January. And so, that's the size of some companies, if you will. So, it's pretty incredible to see the execution in the down market. We have solid pipelines really across the mid-market as well as off-market. The mid-market did incredibly well in the second quarter. From a competitive standpoint, I think we get a lot of questions around the competitive landscape. Has it shifted in the mid-market? What I would offer to you, it hasn't really shifted. It's been a competitive space per us for a long time. It's an area for us that we're executing very, very well. We have best-in-class products. We continue to take friction away from our clients, make it easy for our clients to engage with us. We know this based on our results and retention. We know this based on our results and record NPS. We had good bookings in the mid-market. So, I think the mid-market is solid and certainly not getting any easier for our clients to be employers in the mid-market. As it relates to the international space, I think I covered that already, so I won't touch much more on international, but a good Q2 on the heels of a good Q1. And then in our enterprise and upmarket space, this is an area that has normally, I think it's kind of the new normal on longer deal cycles that have more individuals involved in those cycles. We're paying close attention to it and certainly all the things that are happening kind of across that space. But I would suggest to you that we feel relatively solid about our pipelines and our ability to bring that business in the back half.\nScott Wurtzel: Great. That's helpful. And just a follow-up for Don, just on the float income guidance, sort of noticed a pretty notable increase on your outlook for the client short portfolio. So, just wondering if you can maybe give a little bit of color on sort of the changing geography on those investments for the balance of the year. Thanks.\nDon McGuire: Yes, so maybe let me clarify that for you a little bit. So, really, we haven't changed our investment strategy at all. What we have done is we've tweaked a little bit the way we're going to - we were borrowing funds in the market day in, day out. So, what you're seeing is, we're actually entering the market a little bit early. So, instead of borrowing everything we need to on a peak borrowing day, we've simply spread the borrowing out over two, three days so that we can tap the market in a more - in a smoother way, if you will. And I think if you're looking at the average balances on that - on the appendix sheet that's in the release, you'll notice that that number's gone up in the short fair bit, but that's the driver. So, it's not a change in our investment strategy at all. It's just a change in a bit of a tweak in the way we're actually borrowing funds in the market when we need larger amounts of - when we have larger amounts of borrowing.\nScott Wurtzel: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. First question I had is on EBIT margin. Can you comment on what drove the outperformance versus your view for that to be down I think in 2Q? I'm curious if that was an aspect of timing within the year versus better-than-expected efficiency. And I think, Don, I heard you mentioned some GenAI investments to come. Is that incremental spend versus the prior plan?\nDon McGuire: So, yes, let me start - Bryan, let me start with the first part of your question. So, there was a little bit of modest revenue outperformance in the quarter. So, I think that was a contributor to the margin. And then we had some expenses. We always have focus on expenses. There's a few things, a little bit of bad debt, a little bit of headcount, et cetera, and perhaps a little bit of timing, but nothing significant to really call out as a contributor. In terms of the GenAI spend, yes, we are spending a little bit more than we said we were going to last quarter. So, we do have a bit of incremental spend. It's not a huge amount, but I know that lots of folks like to measure things in 10 bps. So, we are calling it out. Not an incredible amount, but a little bit more than we had said in the prior quarter.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. And then just I guess a follow-up then on GenAI and ADP Assist here. Is that a feature you're able to monetize directly or more so kind of an enhancement you're offering for free to drive the CSAT stores higher? And I guess understanding you're leaning into these developments, do you kind of view it - when you think about the monetization of GenAI products, is this a near-term dynamic or more so kind of feature and product differentiation that's a longer term monetization dynamic?\nMaria Black: So, Bryan, ADP Assist is really the overarching, call it, brand, if you will, that we're leveraging to talk through all the things that we're putting into our product to make things easier. The way that I think about it is it\u2019s really just the next phase of digital transformation for ADP using new tools and technology. So, said differently, our intention is not to charge to make things easier for our clients to do business. That is our commitment to our clients, always has been, is to make it as easy as possible to process payroll, to have accurate payrolls. And so, it's not a monetization effort as it stands. It's really about just leveraging the new technology to step change the digital transformation that we've had underway candidly, for many, many decades since the dawn of the computing era. So, that's kind of how we're thinking about ADP Assist. In terms of monetization in general, do I believe there's monetization as it relates to GenAI? Of course. I think it\u2019s more about the dollar long term, right? So, I think about it - the dollars that we're putting in today will yield multiple dollars for us in years to come. So, there will be distinct monetization opportunities as we create new products into the market, as we think about various things of that nature, perhaps features and functionality. There will also be gains in sales and retention that will lead, in my mind, to investments that are proven today in GenAI to drive incremental bookings and retention over the long term. So, I think it's about putting a dollar in today with the belief that it will yield many dollars of margin to come, if you will, as well as bookings, et cetera.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe on the PEO business, I was curious, I know you guys called out some of the bigger verticals inside of the PEO business and that there's maybe some more softness there than you'd expected in technology and professional services. Any change in the exposure rather inside the PEO business or within like the big verticals? Are you guessing any change in the trends that you saw maybe over the last couple of quarters?\nMaria Black: The trend in specifically professional services has stabilized. And so, I think Danny made the comment earlier, it's no longer contributing to the deceleration. So, it used to - the professional services cohort used to contribute to the acceleration of pays per control, then we found ourselves where it was contributing to a deceleration, and it's largely stabilized at this time.\nSamad Samana: Got you. And just as you think about the pricing environment, I know that we're still not at when the company does the annual price increases, but as you think about maybe for new deals or for new customers that are onboarding, any change in the kind of price pressure or competitive nature of what your competitors are offering in terms of discounts or what ADP's is having to offer? And just as we look ahead to price increases, how are you thinking about this year's price increases?\nDon McGuire: Yes, we're not really seeing any changes, Samad, in the price environment, the competitive environment. We think we're priced appropriately, and we've always acknowledged that we're a little bit of a premium to others. But we're happy with that because we think we offer better service and stability, et cetera. So, no real changes. You're right. It is a little bit early. The budget cycle kicks off here in the next six, eight weeks or so, and we'll certainly be looking at the pricing increases for next year and weighing all the regular factors, what's inflation been? We thought our price increases were very well received last year. We thought they were in line. So, we'll keep that in mind. But as always, we're always interested in the long-term value prop with our clients and being competitive in the market. So, we're always measured, I believe, when we think about the price increases that we do hand out to our clients.\nSamad Samana: Great. Appreciate you taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Mcveigh with UBS. Your line is open.\nKevin Mcveigh: Great. Thanks so much. Maria, I think you talked to kind of implementations a little bit. Can you remind us maybe what percentage of the revenue is done internally on implementations today, and if that's a shift philosophically, what that can be over the course of time? If I heard the remark right. Maybe I picked it up wrong, but just any incremental thoughts on that?\nDon McGuire: Yes, I'll maybe - Kevin, you're a bit soft by the way, but you're a little bit hard to hear, but I think the question was what kind of revenue we derive from implementation, and is that \u2026\nKevin Mcveigh: Yes.\nDon McGuire: Yes, so it's not a substantial. Sub 10% of our overall revenue comes from setup - we internally call it setup fees. So, it's not a substantial amount.\nKevin Mcveigh: And then do you see that - Don, over time, does that become less if you outsource that? And is there any way to think about the margin impact from that initiative?\nDon McGuire: Well, I mean, you also - so, no, I don't think there's a big opportunity there. We certainly have had conversations. We certainly have lots of folks who would like us to outsource our implementation because they think it's a revenue stream for them. We like to have that control over the client from sale-through to go live in service. Not to say that we won't work with third parties to help us from time to time, which we do. But it's really not that large a factor. Certainly, there's some money there to be had, but it's not that large a factor in the overall scheme of things. There's also some interesting accounting, of course, around implementation and setup fees and the deferral over the terms of the contract. So, once again, it would take a lot of changes to do anything, make any changes to the bottom-line financials in the near term.\nKevin Mcveigh: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thanks so much. Good results here. Just want to dig in on your prior comments. I know a lot of people asked on PEO and the healthy activity there and the confidence in the acceleration. Is ADP doing anything differently, or is industry demand changing? I understand it\u2019s not - it doesn't sound like there's a cost of pricing change there. So, I just want to make sure I understood that. Thanks.\nMaria Black: Yes, good morning, and thank you. I am happy to talk about PEO bookings. I think as mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're very pleased with our PEO bookings. This really is the fourth quarter that we've seen positive PEO bookings momentum, and the Q2 specifically exceeded our expectations. Most of the pressure that we felt in the PEO has been a byproduct of kind of the pressure on pays per control and having to overcome that, which is why the focus on bookings has been so paramount for us. And certainly, we deliver that in the second quarter. In terms of from a demand perspective, I speak about the PEO all the time, as you know. I think the demand continues to be incredibly strong. I wouldn't suggest that there's anything unnatural that we are doing outside of a tremendous amount of focus across the enterprise to ensure that we're executing on the PEO booking side. But in terms of anything unnatural or demand changing, I think the value proposition, as I always say, is stronger than it's ever been. I think clients in that space are looking toward ADP to help them from a PEO value proposition. So, everything from payroll to benefits to navigating the complexity of being a business and having the ability to execute on a co-employment relationship. So, I would say the value proposition is as strong as it's ever been. I think it remains strong. The demand is there. The organization is focused on PEO bookings as an execution lever for us. And I'm pleased to see that we did just that in Q2, and we've really had - this marks the fourth quarter of positive bookings momentum from the PEO.\nTien-Tsin Huang: No, that's great. Thank you, Maria.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Caroline (indiscernible) on for Jason. Thanks for taking our question. So, pays per control growth has been 2% quarterly through the first half, but the guide for full-year 2024 is still 1% to 2%. So, what are the drivers of the second half deceleration, or do you think that the high end has become more likely?\nDon McGuire: Caroline, thanks for the question. We said we would go to - we'd be 1% to 2% for the year, and we certainly have that 1% to 2% range still in the back half. We're not really anticipating any slowdown in pays per control, but we certainly have it built in. So, perhaps we're a little bit conservative there. But as we sit here today, the employment demand continues to be robust, although still declining somewhat, but I think we're confident that in the back half, we're going to be declining a little bit, but still coming in on that 1% to 2% range for the year. Not really much more to say there other than employment demand, labor markets continue to be maybe a bit softer than they were, but as we saw this morning in our NER report, hirings still out there, still good growth. So, not a lot of extra color, I don't think, to add around pays per control. \nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Hey, guys, great results here. Just a strategic question, obviously if you look over the next 12 to 18 months, interest rates are coming down. There is a big debate out there on the ability to offset some of those headwinds in terms of revenue. Can you talk about maybe some idiosyncratic initiatives that you could do to offset the headwind from declining interest rates? Thank you so much.\nDon McGuire: I think that's really a macro question. I guess the macro answer to that would be that if interest rates start to decline, we'll see an offsetting increase just in economic activity. And if we see that increase in economic activity, we should see revenue go up. We should see bookings opportunities go up, et cetera. So, I think that if interest rates come down - and there's lots of debates, whether it's two cuts or four cuts, et cetera, who knows, but if they do come down, we should certainly avoid the recession. Nobody's asked about a recession on the call today, so thank you. I think the consensus is that there's not going to be a recession. So, certainly any of the polls suggest that the economy's healthy with 3.3% GDP growth in the last report. So, if rates come down, the economy should remain healthy, and a healthy economy should help continue to contribute to our growth.\nDanny Hussain: Dan, I'll just add also, our model involves reinvesting further out in the yield curve, and as you know, we're still reinvesting at higher rates than what's embedded in the securities that are rolling off. So, even if we do start to see short-term interest rates fall next year, which is obviously consensus at this point, a lot of that will be offset by the reinvestments that we have further out in the yield curve. And so, it's too early to be talking specifically about the interest rate outlook for next year, but we would just recommend you keep that in mind.\nDon McGuire: Yes, that's fair. I think if you look at our reinvestments, our current reinvestments are still at 4%, which is higher than our average yield today. So, there still are opportunities. Our float is expected to continue to grow over the next 12, 24 months. Certainly, it's going to grow a little more slowly than we would've expected at the end of last quarter, but there's still upside from float, which is perhaps not as much upside.\nDan Dolev: Great. Great results, again. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi. Your line is open.\nPete Christiansen: Thank you. Good morning. Two questions. Now that we fully lapped ERTC, I'm just curious if you've noticed any changes in client demands or competitive tactics, particularly in the down market?\nMaria Black: Yes, good morning, Pete. The ERTC, as you know, and I think what you're referencing is the new deadline that was pulled forward five quarters actually. So, the deadline actually as it stands is potentially today. I think we're still waiting for the final kind of execution, if you will, of that new deadline. But arguably, we're having to execute on behalf of our clients with today in mind. And so, there's a tremendous amount of volume that we are pushing through on behalf of our clients, and it has put pressure into the system, which is hard to watch and witness, by the way, as it relates to the very clients that are supposed to be helped by this and the challenges that they're facing trying to navigate it. So, we're doing everything we can in our power to help and process these claims. In terms of financial impact for us as it relates to ERTC, it isn't a financial impact to us. I think it's very de minimis as it relates to our overall revenue, as it relates to our overall incremental. We really, from a standpoint of what we're looking toward, it's about supporting our clients. And so, I think some of our competitors have used it more as a business and a revenue than us as it relates to how we're thinking about it. But undoubtedly, the advancement of this deadline to today has not been ideal for really anyone engaged in it.\nPete Christiansen: That's helpful. And then I'm curious, the combination of HCM and payments functionality, has certainly been a theme. EWA is obviously a big portion of that and now cross border. Do you see opportunities to increase penetration there or to add more capabilities either through partnership, M&A, furthering payments, and I'm thinking perhaps even like in disbursements, those sorts of things? Thank you.\nMaria Black: From a strategic standpoint, Pete, what I would offer is continuing to solve for our clients and employees and how they engage with us. If you imagine across ADP, we pay 41 million wage earners in the US. That's 25 million. I think last time we talked about our Wisely offering, what we disclosed was that we had 1.5 cardholders or something like that. So, to just kind of give you the opportunity scale of it, we believe there's tremendous opportunity to increase how we're engaging with our clients, whether that's through the likes of Wisely, it's through the likes of EWA, as you're suggesting, or it's any other type of payments and things that we can do to make it easier for our clients and employees to move through the world of work, right? And so, the way I think about it and the partnerships that we're actively out there in the market talking to and thinking about, anywhere we can add value in our clients and employee life and flow. So, as they move through their day and they clock in through ADP's mobile app, which by the way, we have 10 million users that are actively using our ADP mobile app, so as they're engaging with ADP, are there opportunities for us to insert value there? Whether that's things like EWA, it's things like payments, it's things like financial and wellness apps like the companion app we have through Wisely. These are all top of mind for us as we go through our strategic discussions and as we think about partnerships in the future for ADP.\nPete Christiansen: Thank you so much. Super helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. We have time for one last question, and that question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. So, just a multipart question on PEO and following up on some of the commentary earlier on solid bookings and moderating PPC, sorry, paper control headwinds. As we look at the WSC growth, we have continued to see a sequential improvement there, better than what we saw last year. And just given the commentary, is it fair for us to assume that we should continue to see that improve as we go through the year? And then on revenue per WSC, I was wondering if you could comment on, looks like pricing trends are positive, but if you could comment on any other puts and takes participation, anything else that could help drive better revenue per works at employee. Thanks.\nMaria Black: So, the answer to your question is, yes, we do expect that the booking contribution, coupled with a bit of stability on the pays per control side, coupled with retention getting more favorable on the back half, all of those things should lead to the re-acceleration that Don mentioned earlier, that we've been pointing to in the back half. I think in terms of other componentry within the PEO, you mentioned a few of them. There's payroll per works on employee. There's workers' compensation. There's State unemployment. Some of these things are things that we're still waiting to really see the outcomes. I'll give you an example. One of those is State unemployment in terms of - obviously, we sit here today forecasting what that looks like. Most of those rates are issued throughout this quarter. And so, while we have some line of sight, in the end, we don't know entirely what the State unemployment outcome - we do expect that it creates a little bit of a - rates are going down year-on-year again this year. But again, only time will tell. Sometimes the States, as an example, make very strange decisions that aren't always in line with what's happening from a broader labor and unemployment perspective. So, all that to say, I think - I don't know that I could sit here today and give you any componentry that seems strange or out of the norm. I think they're all things we're watching as we look toward the re-acceleration in the PEO in the back half.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. Congrats on the solid results.\nOperator: Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Maria Black for any closing remarks.\nMaria Black: Yes. So, really quickly, I think I'll end with how I ended my prepared remarks, which is a huge shout-out to all of the associates and the entire ecosystem across ADP. So, that's ADP associates, partners, channels, all of the stakeholders that really contributed to what was a good, solid Q2, but also a good, solid first half. I'm really excited about the back half and what we'll accomplish, not just in fiscal 2024, but moreover in calendar 2024. It's a time and it's an exciting year for ADP. This year is the year that we actually round our 75th anniversary. And then when I think about who this company is over the last seven decades and 75 years, I can't wait to see what we're going to do in the next 75. So, look forward to sharing in that celebration with all of you as we head into 2024 together. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does include the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Maria Black",
            "content": "Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. This morning, we reported strong second quarter results, including 6% revenue growth and 9% adjusted EPS growth. I'll begin with a review of the quarter's financial highlights, before providing an update on the progress we are making across our strategic priorities. We delivered solid Employer Services new business bookings in the second quarter, reaching a new record bookings volume for Q2, and keeping us on track for our full-year outlook. Growth was especially robust across our small business portfolio, and we also experience healthy growth in our mid-market and international business. With steady demand in HCM and a healthy new business pipeline at the end of the quarter, we look forward to the important selling season ahead. Employer Services retention was strong in the second quarter. Although it declined slightly compared to the prior year, we once again exceeded our expectations as we continue to benefit from a healthy overall business environment, and from our very high client satisfaction levels. Our Employer Services pays per control growth remained at 2% for the second quarter. The overall labor market remains resilient, and our clients continue to add employees at a moderate pace, which is resulting in a very gradual deceleration and pays per control growth. And last, our PEO revenue growth of 3% for the second quarter, was in line with our expectations, and we are very pleased to have delivered strong PEO new business bookings that were ahead of our expectations. Based on continued healthy activity levels, we feel good about our PEO bookings momentum, and we look forward to seeing a gradual re-acceleration of our PEO business in the second half of this fiscal year.  Moving on to a broader update. During the second quarter, we launched a new brand advertising campaign themed, the next anything. The campaign highlights how the world of work is always changing, sometimes gradually, sometimes suddenly, and trusted business solutions must evolve with it. The theme aligns with our strategic priorities to give our clients the advantage of our leading technology, expertise, and scale. In Q2, we continue to push forward on our first strategic priority to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. A key part of that is the rollout of ADP Assist, our cross-platform solution powered by GenAI that proactively delivers actionable insights in plain language to enhance HR productivity, aid decision-making, and streamline day-to-day tasks for our clients and their employees. ADP Assist seamlessly integrates with ADP products across multiple platforms. Using an intuitive conversational interface, it provides valuable and contextual insights which touch every aspect of HR. For example, in addition to the features we shared with you last quarter, including our natural language reporting capability, in Q2, we integrated natural language search capabilities into our run platform, which allows it to understand intent behind the search terms and use GenAI to mine ADP's deep knowledge base to deliver easy to use and effective content. ADP Assist also helps clients validate payrolls and solve common employee challenges across HR, payroll, time, and benefits. It's a comprehensive experience that is trained on the industry's largest and deepest HCM dataset and our deep knowledge base to surface highly credible and actionable insights so that clients can make smarter decisions.  We are excited about the roadmap ahead for all of our major solutions, and we expect it to help us build on the recognition we continue to earn in the market. In Q2 alone, we were pleased to be recognized for product leadership by three major industry analyst rankings. Everest Group named ADP the highest leader out of 27 providers in its multi-country payroll solutions PEAK Matrix report. NelsonHall identified ADP as a leader in its Payroll Services Vendor Evaluation and Assessment tool in all markets. And Ventana Research named us an exemplary leader across its North American, global, and payroll management buyers guide for performing the best and meeting overall product and customer experience requirements. Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing solutions. We shared last quarter that we were beginning to equip our associates with GenAI capabilities through our Agent Assist technology. In Q2, we expanded our call summarization deployment to a greater portion of our service associates and started to see productivity gains with shorter handle time and improved service quality. With our global service associates fielding millions of calls annually, we are incredibly excited to test ways to optimize those client interactions.  Our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients through our global scale, and we continue to lean into this advantage. In Q2, we announced a strategic collaboration with Convera, a global business to business payments company to help our multi-country clients manage the complexity of global payroll and cross-border payments through an integrated platform. By combining Convera\u2019s payment solutions with our global payroll expertise, we're enhancing the client experience by minimizing the need to access various banking platforms and improving payment accuracy, compliance, and security. We also announced the launch of ADP retirement trust services to support our growing retirement services business. Standing up our own trust services entity demonstrates our scale and commitment to our retirement clients, positioning us on par with financial industry leaders and ahead of HCM competitors that rely on third parties. This commitment can really matter to financial advisors, keeps data within ADP's trusted ecosystem, and provides a cost and price benefit to ADP and our clients over the long term. Our scale also affords us the opportunity to partner with other leading technology providers in innovative ways, and we continue to expand on many of those partnerships to provide our sales implementation and service teams with client-specific insights to quickly address market shifts, drive more personalized interactions, and deepen our overall client engagement.  Overall, our second quarter represented strong outcomes on the financial front and with respect to our key strategic priorities. I'd like to thank our associates who continue to deliver exceptional products and outstanding service to our clients, particularly now, as many of them are in the middle of our most hectic time of year completing year-end work. I'm proud to share that their efforts help drive our overall Net Promoter Score to its highest level ever in the second quarter. Thank you again for all that you do for ADP and for our clients. And now, I'll turn it over to Don. Thank you, Mark, and good morning. Appreciate the question and appreciate your well wishes on all of our recognition. Certainly excited to see across the board the recognition we mentioned during the prepared remarks, but also the continued momentum across all of our initiatives. Happy to comment on retirement trust services. It is really a demonstration of our scale. And so, when I think about what it means to our clients, what it means to the ecosystem that you mentioned, banks, CPAs, I think it's all incredibly positive. And trust services are a core component of any 401(k) plan. Given the size and scale of our retirement services business, what we found is that the pool of what's known as third-party trustees, if you will, that are capable of handling a business just of our size, is actually becoming shrinkingly more difficult, if you will, in terms of the number of providers that are able to offer standalone trust services to a retirement offering of our size. So, in terms of that, we made the decision to launch our in-house trust services. We believe that this is a great value to our clients, to the ecosystem. It puts us on par with other industry leaders and the financial services, and really a competitive advantage against some of our HCM competitors that continue to leverage these third-party trustees. So, for us, I think it's a big commitment to the business that we have, the retirement business that is, which really can matter to financial advisors, and as you said, CPAs and banks. Really by taking the trust services in-house, the implication is that we have better control over our costs. Ultimately, that yields a better price for our clients, a better service. We also have the ability to maintain all of the data inside of ADP's ecosystem, which as you know, is a big component of who ADP is in terms of data integrity and all those things. So, that's kind of the retirement trust services in a nutshell, Mark. So, retention is going incredibly well, right? And we mentioned that in the remarks. Year-to-date retention has definitely been better than we expected. And so, I think things are fundamentally really healthy right now. One thing to keep in mind as kind of think about the outlook, is that we are, as you mentioned, we are coming off of some of the record highs that we've seen over the last several years. And while we believe that from specifically a down market perspective, we're close to being normalized back to fiscal 2019 trends, we do also anticipate some pressure in the back half from perhaps out of business and bankruptcies having more of a material impact. We haven't seen it to date, but we certainly want to ensure that we're cognizant of the fact and we believe it's prudent - given that we have retention running at such record levels, we believe it's prudent to plan for it in the back half to have some pressure. And obviously, just like any year, Mark, retention is always noisy until we have some normal variability and conservatism in the back half. Just like you, I'd like to think that there's opportunity there. I think only time will give us the answer to that, but that's kind of how we're thinking about the back half. Yes, so I'll start on the on the AI side and tell you all the reasons again that I'm so excited about it. Maybe Don can give you a little bit about how we're thinking about the return on investments that we're making. So, just to remind everyone how we're thinking about AI, in its most simplistic way, I think about it really in three buckets, the first of which is product and innovation. So, putting generative AI into all of our innovation cycles. So, that's everything from product development to the features and functionality that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And by the way, later this morning, we're actually issuing a press release that goes through some of our product and innovation, call it, philosophy and launches of products, right? So, some of what this press release speaks to is how we're thinking about and our design principles around making things easy, smart, and human within our product and innovation cycles to really drive things like payroll assist, things like ADP Assist into the market in a meaningful way. So, product is really kind of the first bucket. And as you'll see, we're making significant investments there. We do have ADP Assist now more broadly deployed across the product set, and we're seeing meaningful impact as it relates to our client experience on that. The second bucket is what I call efficiency and service efficiency. And this is really about giving all the same things that we're looking to give our clients to make their jobs easier and more effective and efficient, and giving those same tools to our associates. And so, we have Agent Assist. I'm pleased to say that from an Agent Assist perspective, we've more than doubled the number of associates today that are engaging in AI tools overall. Specifically, a big piece of that is anchored in Agent Assist and the things we're doing around call summarization. Again, I'll let Don comment on investments and return, but just to kind of give you a flavor of what we're talking about here, the feedback we're getting from our associates is, there are times we're shaving off a minute or two minutes by aiding things like call summarization. And while that probably seems minuscule, what I would offer to you is we have thousands of service associates, and we also have millions and millions of calls that we take every single year. And so, we're pretty optimistic and excited about a minute here and a minute there, and what that means from an incremental opportunity for us over time, right? So, we continue to lean into our service efficiency and really getting all of our associates more effective as it relates to their ability to engage with our clients. And then last but not least - by the way, I could go on and on and on all day on this topic, but last but not least and very, very important is how we're thinking about generative AI in our go-to market motions. And so, we have for years been at the tip of the spear of sales modernization. We have partnerships that are two decades old where we've always been leading the way with what it looks like to have a best-in-class modern distribution and sales force, and this is no different for us. So, we already have a broad set of our sellers leveraging tools along the lines of Generative AI, many of which are through our best-in-class vendors and partners that we have, and we're seeing great impact there. Things that I used to do myself at a personal level manually, such as pre-call planning, by the way, things like call summarization for prospecting, these are big items for us as it relates to our go-to-market motions, and we've just started scratching the surface. So, all in, really excited again. Just to kind of wrap it all up, I think it's about product, service efficiency, and our go-to-market motions. We are making active investments. Some of those investments are things that we've shifted that we were already working on in digital transformation. Some of it is incremental investments. And so, I think with that, I'll turn it over to Don who can kind of talk about how we're thinking about our incremental investments and moreover the return on that. That's right. If I may, one of the things, I think what Don is suggesting is really the opportunity we have with international. And so, when you put it in the context of the business that we have in the US there, there is a tremendous opportunity for us to think more broadly in international partnerships as the one Don just outlined with Convera, is a big piece of that. What I would also add is that from an international perspective, we did call out the performance specifically in Q2 on international. That's, by the way, bookings. That's on the heels of a solid Q1. What I would offer as well, we have record retention. We have record customer experience and client experience in international. So, I think we have a tremendous value proposition in international. By the way, some of the recognition I cited during the prepared remarks is really about how best-in-class our offer is with respect to the international offering we have. So, that said, as Don mentioned, we're not satisfied. I think there's more opportunity to us to scale and grow our beyond payroll offerings, partnerships that are a big piece of that, but undoubtedly, we're performing and competing very, very well internationally. Oh, you know what, let me just comment because you mentioned Roll in international, so I just thought I'd mention that really quickly, which is, we are very excited about the down market in international. Roll is one way that we're getting after that. And the pilot programs that we're running are teaching us a lot as we think about the down market and international. Yes, good morning, Scott. We feel good about the demand environment overall at this point. I think companies are still hiring. We saw that this morning actually as well. And companies are still investing in their people, their talent. They're investing in HR. I think there are a couple things I'd highlight to you. The down market, definitely companies are continuing to hire and they're continuing to buy. We had tremendous second quarter results. By the way, that business has been executing incredibly well really for many, many quarters. And that's our run offering, but it's also all the things that are attached to run. So, think insurance services, retirement services. All of the down market is doing incredibly well. To give you a little bit of a line of sight, because it is the 31st of January, so we do actually have a tiny bit of visibility specifically to the down market. And you asked about trends into the third quarter. What I would offer to you is January looks good. I think we're actually on track to onboard something close to like 30,000 units in that business alone in the month of January. And so, that's the size of some companies, if you will. So, it's pretty incredible to see the execution in the down market. We have solid pipelines really across the mid-market as well as off-market. The mid-market did incredibly well in the second quarter. From a competitive standpoint, I think we get a lot of questions around the competitive landscape. Has it shifted in the mid-market? What I would offer to you, it hasn't really shifted. It's been a competitive space per us for a long time. It's an area for us that we're executing very, very well. We have best-in-class products. We continue to take friction away from our clients, make it easy for our clients to engage with us. We know this based on our results and retention. We know this based on our results and record NPS. We had good bookings in the mid-market. So, I think the mid-market is solid and certainly not getting any easier for our clients to be employers in the mid-market. As it relates to the international space, I think I covered that already, so I won't touch much more on international, but a good Q2 on the heels of a good Q1. And then in our enterprise and upmarket space, this is an area that has normally, I think it's kind of the new normal on longer deal cycles that have more individuals involved in those cycles. We're paying close attention to it and certainly all the things that are happening kind of across that space. But I would suggest to you that we feel relatively solid about our pipelines and our ability to bring that business in the back half. So, Bryan, ADP Assist is really the overarching, call it, brand, if you will, that we're leveraging to talk through all the things that we're putting into our product to make things easier. The way that I think about it is it\u2019s really just the next phase of digital transformation for ADP using new tools and technology. So, said differently, our intention is not to charge to make things easier for our clients to do business. That is our commitment to our clients, always has been, is to make it as easy as possible to process payroll, to have accurate payrolls. And so, it's not a monetization effort as it stands. It's really about just leveraging the new technology to step change the digital transformation that we've had underway candidly, for many, many decades since the dawn of the computing era. So, that's kind of how we're thinking about ADP Assist. In terms of monetization in general, do I believe there's monetization as it relates to GenAI? Of course. I think it\u2019s more about the dollar long term, right? So, I think about it - the dollars that we're putting in today will yield multiple dollars for us in years to come. So, there will be distinct monetization opportunities as we create new products into the market, as we think about various things of that nature, perhaps features and functionality. There will also be gains in sales and retention that will lead, in my mind, to investments that are proven today in GenAI to drive incremental bookings and retention over the long term. So, I think it's about putting a dollar in today with the belief that it will yield many dollars of margin to come, if you will, as well as bookings, et cetera. The trend in specifically professional services has stabilized. And so, I think Danny made the comment earlier, it's no longer contributing to the deceleration. So, it used to - the professional services cohort used to contribute to the acceleration of pays per control, then we found ourselves where it was contributing to a deceleration, and it's largely stabilized at this time. Yes, good morning, and thank you. I am happy to talk about PEO bookings. I think as mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're very pleased with our PEO bookings. This really is the fourth quarter that we've seen positive PEO bookings momentum, and the Q2 specifically exceeded our expectations. Most of the pressure that we felt in the PEO has been a byproduct of kind of the pressure on pays per control and having to overcome that, which is why the focus on bookings has been so paramount for us. And certainly, we deliver that in the second quarter. In terms of from a demand perspective, I speak about the PEO all the time, as you know. I think the demand continues to be incredibly strong. I wouldn't suggest that there's anything unnatural that we are doing outside of a tremendous amount of focus across the enterprise to ensure that we're executing on the PEO booking side. But in terms of anything unnatural or demand changing, I think the value proposition, as I always say, is stronger than it's ever been. I think clients in that space are looking toward ADP to help them from a PEO value proposition. So, everything from payroll to benefits to navigating the complexity of being a business and having the ability to execute on a co-employment relationship. So, I would say the value proposition is as strong as it's ever been. I think it remains strong. The demand is there. The organization is focused on PEO bookings as an execution lever for us. And I'm pleased to see that we did just that in Q2, and we've really had - this marks the fourth quarter of positive bookings momentum from the PEO. Yes, good morning, Pete. The ERTC, as you know, and I think what you're referencing is the new deadline that was pulled forward five quarters actually. So, the deadline actually as it stands is potentially today. I think we're still waiting for the final kind of execution, if you will, of that new deadline. But arguably, we're having to execute on behalf of our clients with today in mind. And so, there's a tremendous amount of volume that we are pushing through on behalf of our clients, and it has put pressure into the system, which is hard to watch and witness, by the way, as it relates to the very clients that are supposed to be helped by this and the challenges that they're facing trying to navigate it. So, we're doing everything we can in our power to help and process these claims. In terms of financial impact for us as it relates to ERTC, it isn't a financial impact to us. I think it's very de minimis as it relates to our overall revenue, as it relates to our overall incremental. We really, from a standpoint of what we're looking toward, it's about supporting our clients. And so, I think some of our competitors have used it more as a business and a revenue than us as it relates to how we're thinking about it. But undoubtedly, the advancement of this deadline to today has not been ideal for really anyone engaged in it. From a strategic standpoint, Pete, what I would offer is continuing to solve for our clients and employees and how they engage with us. If you imagine across ADP, we pay 41 million wage earners in the US. That's 25 million. I think last time we talked about our Wisely offering, what we disclosed was that we had 1.5 cardholders or something like that. So, to just kind of give you the opportunity scale of it, we believe there's tremendous opportunity to increase how we're engaging with our clients, whether that's through the likes of Wisely, it's through the likes of EWA, as you're suggesting, or it's any other type of payments and things that we can do to make it easier for our clients and employees to move through the world of work, right? And so, the way I think about it and the partnerships that we're actively out there in the market talking to and thinking about, anywhere we can add value in our clients and employee life and flow. So, as they move through their day and they clock in through ADP's mobile app, which by the way, we have 10 million users that are actively using our ADP mobile app, so as they're engaging with ADP, are there opportunities for us to insert value there? Whether that's things like EWA, it's things like payments, it's things like financial and wellness apps like the companion app we have through Wisely. These are all top of mind for us as we go through our strategic discussions and as we think about partnerships in the future for ADP. So, the answer to your question is, yes, we do expect that the booking contribution, coupled with a bit of stability on the pays per control side, coupled with retention getting more favorable on the back half, all of those things should lead to the re-acceleration that Don mentioned earlier, that we've been pointing to in the back half. I think in terms of other componentry within the PEO, you mentioned a few of them. There's payroll per works on employee. There's workers' compensation. There's State unemployment. Some of these things are things that we're still waiting to really see the outcomes. I'll give you an example. One of those is State unemployment in terms of - obviously, we sit here today forecasting what that looks like. Most of those rates are issued throughout this quarter. And so, while we have some line of sight, in the end, we don't know entirely what the State unemployment outcome - we do expect that it creates a little bit of a - rates are going down year-on-year again this year. But again, only time will tell. Sometimes the States, as an example, make very strange decisions that aren't always in line with what's happening from a broader labor and unemployment perspective. So, all that to say, I think - I don't know that I could sit here today and give you any componentry that seems strange or out of the norm. I think they're all things we're watching as we look toward the re-acceleration in the PEO in the back half. Yes. So, really quickly, I think I'll end with how I ended my prepared remarks, which is a huge shout-out to all of the associates and the entire ecosystem across ADP. So, that's ADP associates, partners, channels, all of the stakeholders that really contributed to what was a good, solid Q2, but also a good, solid first half. I'm really excited about the back half and what we'll accomplish, not just in fiscal 2024, but moreover in calendar 2024. It's a time and it's an exciting year for ADP. This year is the year that we actually round our 75th anniversary. And then when I think about who this company is over the last seven decades and 75 years, I can't wait to see what we're going to do in the next 75. So, look forward to sharing in that celebration with all of you as we head into 2024 together. Thank you."

            "name": "Don McGuire",
            "content": "Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide more color on our results for the quarter, as well as our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. Overall, we reported a strong second quarter, with our consolidated revenue growth moderating in line with our expectations, and our adjusted EBIT margin coming in slightly better than expected. However, the interest rate backdrop has changed since we last provided our full-year outlook, and we are lightly tweaking our outlook, which I'll detail. I'll start with Employer Services. ES segment revenue increased 8% on a reported basis, and 7% on an organic constant currency basis, coming in slightly ahead of our expectations. As Maria shared, we continue to grow our ES new business bookings, resulting in a record second quarter bookings volume. Our small business portfolio and international business provided outsized growth contributions this quarter. And with a steady HCM demand environment and healthy pipelines, we feel on track for our 4% to 7% new business bookings growth outlook for the year. As mentioned earlier, our ES retention declined slightly in Q2 versus the prior year, but again exceeded our expectations. Given our first half retention outperformance, we are increasing our full-year retention outlook slightly. We now anticipate a 40 to 60 basis point decline in our full-year retention, which is 10 basis points better than our prior forecast.  ES pays per control growth of 2% in Q2, was in line with our expectations, and we are maintaining our 1% to 2% growth outlook for the full-year. And client funds interest revenue increased in line with our expectations in Q2, as a slight decline in our average client funds balance, which we discussed last quarter, was more than offset by an increase in our average yield. However, we are revising our full-year client funds interest outlook lower to reflect the change in prevailing interest rates since our last update. We now expect fiscal 2024 client funds interest revenue of $985 million to $995 million, and we expect a net impact from our client funds extended investment strategy of $835 million to $845 million, representing a reduction of about $20 million at the midpoint. In total, there is no change to our fiscal 2024 ES revenue growth forecast of 7% to 8%. Our ES margin increased 170 basis points in Q2, driven by both operating leverage and contribution from client funds interest revenue growth, but reflecting the impact of a reduced client funds interest revenue forecast, as well as a slight increase in expected GenAI related spend, we are tweaking our fiscal 2024 ES margin outlook and now anticipate the lower end of our prior margin range. Moving on to the PEO, we had 3% revenue growth, driven by 2% growth in average work site employees in the second quarter. These metrics were in line with expectation, and we are encouraged to see signs of stabilization in our PEO pays per control growth. As Maria mentioned, our PEO new business bookings were very strong in Q2. With continued healthy activity levels, we continue to anticipate a gradual ramp in our work site employee growth in the back half of fiscal 2024, and we are maintaining our full-year growth outlook of 2% to 3%. PEO margin decreased 50 basis points in Q2. As we shared last quarter, we assume this year's workers' compensation reserve release benefit will be lower than last year's benefit, and we are further narrowing our PEO margin expectation to be down 80 to 100 basis points in fiscal 2024 versus our prior expectation of decline of 50 to 100 basis points.  Putting it all together, there is no change to our fiscal 2024 consolidated revenue growth outlook of 6% to 7%. With the two changes to segment margin, we now expect our adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 60 to 70 basis points versus our prior outlook, for an increase of 60 to 80 basis points. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of around 23%, and we still anticipate fiscal 2024 adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12%, with the middle of that range the most likely outcome given current assumptions.  Thank you, and I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A. Yes, James, thanks for that question. We've been happy to see the stabilization in the pays per control in those sectors, the financial services and technology sector. So, although there's still a little bit of noise there, it's certainly stabilized from what we saw in the prior quarter. So, that's positive. I do think that as we looked at our sales results, our bookings for PEO, we were very happy with the bookings. Maria mentioned that already very good. I think as we kind of put those together, the improvement in the pays per control and the improvement in our bookings, I think we're going to be heading towards that re-acceleration that we've been pointing to over the last couple of quarters in the PEO. But really just trying to get the impact of those two components, those variables, is really what's going to help us get that re-acceleration going. Yes, so I think Maria just outlined some of the exciting areas that GenAI will have for us and some of the things that'll change, how they'll make the client experience better, how they'll help our associates, how they'll help us sell more, et cetera. But I would say at this point in time, what we're really talking about is some modest investments in GenAI. I think it's going to be a little while before we start to see returns from those things, but we certainly do anticipate returns. But in the near term right now, it's really a time for investing in these tools, et cetera, and we'll see those outcomes, those financial outcomes somewhere down the road. Yes, I don't think there's - just to answer the question, there's nothing really unusual or fundamentally different about our selling expenses and how we go-to-market in the PEO. I think certainly as we see higher sales, as you know, we get a lot of our sales, half of our sales, give or take, from internal. So, some of that's a little bit of our internal housekeeping if you will, how we allocate expenses between business units, et cetera. But higher sales generally translate into higher selling expenses. So, really nothing fundamentally different in how we go-to-market. Certainly, not seeing any fundamental differences in the competitive landscape that's driving those expenses. Yes, I'll start, and Maria can add here in a second. So, as you know, you look at our revenue as - international revenue as a percentage the total, and it\u2019s not where we'd like it to be, even though roughly 40% of the people we bear around world are in international. So, and the reason for that is that we have fundamentally different offers in the US. We have things like PEO. We also have money movement services, tax services, pretty much broadly distributed. Some of those offers don't have the same value proposition outside of the US market. So, our opportunity there is not quite the same. Perhaps it will be as time goes on, some of those services may be available in other markets, but as we speak today, they're not there. The value prop isn't the same. With respect to Convera as a partner, just to speak to that one a little bit, we have thousands of clients, and those thousands of clients have thousands of entities spread across multiple countries around the world. And if you think about the complexity and the difficulty of paying their people in some of these small countries and then getting the payments to the various social security providers in those countries, having somebody like Convera who can help a large European or a large US multinational manage the treasury function in those small countries around the world without having to set up all the banking, et cetera. So, someone like Convera acts as a great partner for us to facilitate those cross-border payments in a very - in a compliant way, et cetera. So, I think that's very positive for us. So, we do have some partners in international like Convera as I just mentioned, but we still see it as a great opportunity for us to continue to grow. No, I think you were right to call out the payroll deferral, payroll tax deferral. That definitely was behind the decline quarter-to-quarter. We don't - that's now behind us. So, that's not going to be there. So, we are expecting 2% to 3% balanced growth throughout the balance of the year. So, we think that's very positive. I think the big callout though on the whole CFI program is just the fact that since we spoke last, five-year and 10-year interest rates are down about 80 bps on both of those. And so, I think that's a little bit of the headwind and that's roughly the $20 million or so that we're calling down the float number for the balance of the year. But still very optimistic about growth. Certainly, the reason that it's not growing as quickly perhaps as it did last year, we've certainly seen some moderation in wage growth, and we've talked about even though pays per control are behaving as we expected, they are certainly lower - pays per control growth is lower than it was in the back half, but will be lower in the back half of this year than it was in the back half of last year. So, those would be the major influencers, if you will, to the full balance as we go forward to the back half. Yes, so, you're right. I think the float certainly is a component of us guiding to the middle of our range, for sure. So, that's a component. We don't try to second guess the markets. We use yield curves that are out there in the market to estimate what we think our returns are going to be. So, no real surprises, other than seeing what's happening in the overall market. And then we're taking the forward yield curves and applying those to our balances, and that's where we land. Yes, so maybe let me clarify that for you a little bit. So, really, we haven't changed our investment strategy at all. What we have done is we've tweaked a little bit the way we're going to - we were borrowing funds in the market day in, day out. So, what you're seeing is, we're actually entering the market a little bit early. So, instead of borrowing everything we need to on a peak borrowing day, we've simply spread the borrowing out over two, three days so that we can tap the market in a more - in a smoother way, if you will. And I think if you're looking at the average balances on that - on the appendix sheet that's in the release, you'll notice that that number's gone up in the short fair bit, but that's the driver. So, it's not a change in our investment strategy at all. It's just a change in a bit of a tweak in the way we're actually borrowing funds in the market when we need larger amounts of - when we have larger amounts of borrowing. So, yes, let me start - Bryan, let me start with the first part of your question. So, there was a little bit of modest revenue outperformance in the quarter. So, I think that was a contributor to the margin. And then we had some expenses. We always have focus on expenses. There's a few things, a little bit of bad debt, a little bit of headcount, et cetera, and perhaps a little bit of timing, but nothing significant to really call out as a contributor. In terms of the GenAI spend, yes, we are spending a little bit more than we said we were going to last quarter. So, we do have a bit of incremental spend. It's not a huge amount, but I know that lots of folks like to measure things in 10 bps. So, we are calling it out. Not an incredible amount, but a little bit more than we had said in the prior quarter. Yes, we're not really seeing any changes, Samad, in the price environment, the competitive environment. We think we're priced appropriately, and we've always acknowledged that we're a little bit of a premium to others. But we're happy with that because we think we offer better service and stability, et cetera. So, no real changes. You're right. It is a little bit early. The budget cycle kicks off here in the next six, eight weeks or so, and we'll certainly be looking at the pricing increases for next year and weighing all the regular factors, what's inflation been? We thought our price increases were very well received last year. We thought they were in line. So, we'll keep that in mind. But as always, we're always interested in the long-term value prop with our clients and being competitive in the market. So, we're always measured, I believe, when we think about the price increases that we do hand out to our clients. Yes, I'll maybe - Kevin, you're a bit soft by the way, but you're a little bit hard to hear, but I think the question was what kind of revenue we derive from implementation, and is that \u2026 Yes, so it's not a substantial. Sub 10% of our overall revenue comes from setup - we internally call it setup fees. So, it's not a substantial amount. Well, I mean, you also - so, no, I don't think there's a big opportunity there. We certainly have had conversations. We certainly have lots of folks who would like us to outsource our implementation because they think it's a revenue stream for them. We like to have that control over the client from sale-through to go live in service. Not to say that we won't work with third parties to help us from time to time, which we do. But it's really not that large a factor. Certainly, there's some money there to be had, but it's not that large a factor in the overall scheme of things. There's also some interesting accounting, of course, around implementation and setup fees and the deferral over the terms of the contract. So, once again, it would take a lot of changes to do anything, make any changes to the bottom-line financials in the near term. Caroline, thanks for the question. We said we would go to - we'd be 1% to 2% for the year, and we certainly have that 1% to 2% range still in the back half. We're not really anticipating any slowdown in pays per control, but we certainly have it built in. So, perhaps we're a little bit conservative there. But as we sit here today, the employment demand continues to be robust, although still declining somewhat, but I think we're confident that in the back half, we're going to be declining a little bit, but still coming in on that 1% to 2% range for the year. Not really much more to say there other than employment demand, labor markets continue to be maybe a bit softer than they were, but as we saw this morning in our NER report, hirings still out there, still good growth. So, not a lot of extra color, I don't think, to add around pays per control. I think that's really a macro question. I guess the macro answer to that would be that if interest rates start to decline, we'll see an offsetting increase just in economic activity. And if we see that increase in economic activity, we should see revenue go up. We should see bookings opportunities go up, et cetera. So, I think that if interest rates come down - and there's lots of debates, whether it's two cuts or four cuts, et cetera, who knows, but if they do come down, we should certainly avoid the recession. Nobody's asked about a recession on the call today, so thank you. I think the consensus is that there's not going to be a recession. So, certainly any of the polls suggest that the economy's healthy with 3.3% GDP growth in the last report. So, if rates come down, the economy should remain healthy, and a healthy economy should help continue to contribute to our growth. Yes, that's fair. I think if you look at our reinvestments, our current reinvestments are still at 4%, which is higher than our average yield today. So, there still are opportunities. Our float is expected to continue to grow over the next 12, 24 months. Certainly, it's going to grow a little more slowly than we would've expected at the end of last quarter, but there's still upside from float, which is perhaps not as much upside."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Michelle, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danny Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanyal Hussain: Thank you, Michelle, and welcome everyone to ADP's first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I'll now turn it over to Maria.\nMaria Black: Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported strong first quarter results, including 7% revenue growth and 12% adjusted EPS growth, and we made significant progress on the three strategic priorities we shared with you last quarter. Let me begin by quickly reviewing some of our financial highlights from the first quarter. We had a solid start to the year in Employer Services new business bookings with record-level volume for first quarter which was supported by a particularly strong September. Among our best performers were our small business portfolio and our compliance-oriented solutions. Overall demand in HCM has remained steady and we maintained a healthy new business pipeline at the end of the quarter across our business. Our Employer Services retention rate once again exceeded our expectations. Although, retention declined slightly versus the prior year, including in our small business portfolio, we continued to see resilience among our clients. More importantly, our overall NPS scores reached a new all-time high, positioning us to stay near these historically high retention levels. Our Employer Services pays per control growth was 2% for the first quarter as our clients continued to add employees at a pace that is gradually slowing. And our PEO revenue growth of 3% in the quarter was relatively stable versus last quarter, reflecting solid PEO bookings performance offset by deceleration in PEO pays per control growth. Don will speak to our updated guidance in a moment, but the demand environment for PEO as well as our other outsourcing services remains healthy. Moving on, we made meaningful progress across all three of our strategic priorities that we outlined last quarter. Let me start with an update on some actions we took in Q1 to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. First, we began embedding Gen AI features into our products. In Q1, we integrated Gen AI into Roll to further enhance its conversational UI and make it even easier for small business owners to quickly obtain customized Payroll and HR guidance. We also began rolling out ADP Assist, which delivers insights and recommendations to make complex HR work simple. We've enabled ADP Assist for select Workforce Now clients, beginning with a Report Assist feature that allows practitioners to easily extract the insights they're looking for. We look forward to continuing to build on the live feature set of ADP Assist to further enhance the experiences of both HR practitioners and employees. We also had some exciting product developments beyond AI. Our clients tell us they need personalized experiences and deep integrations to help them manage the complexity of running a business today. To help address this, we recently launched a new product called API Central, which enables businesses to easily and securely connect their ADP workforce data across systems using pre-populated APIs and tools. This is a feature our clients have increasingly asked for and we have already seen a strong uptake. In Q1, we complemented the launch of API Central with the acquisition of Sora, an intelligent workflow automation and data integration tool. Sora's unique capabilities will allow our clients to automate people processes by unifying various applications such as HR, IT, CRM, and more, creating a smarter and easier-to-use experience for our clients. In Q1, we also launched ADP Workforce Now for construction, a comprehensive offering designed to help clients with the unique payroll and HCM needs of the construction industry. This verticalized offering combines tailored Workforce Now capabilities and reporting with a team of dedicated specialists for the construction industry. While ADP has always served clients across the full spectrum of industries, construction stood out to us as a vertical with enough complexity to warrant a more tailored solution, and we're excited to further strengthen our offering in the mid-market. We also announced the launch of our corporate venture capital fund earlier this month, leading with best-in-class HCM technology requires that we stay attuned to the frontier of HCM innovation. And now, in addition to the organic efforts we are developing in ADP Ventures, we will invest in and partner with early-stage startups to strengthen our core business our core business and to extend into natural adjacencies. Two of our early investments focus on improving lifestyle benefits to drive associate engagement in simplifying the incredibly complex leave management process that businesses and their workers have to address. We're excited to build on these partnerships and develop new ones. Overall, Q1 was a very busy quarter on the product front with much of the work we're doing representing seeds of innovation that will position us to continue shaping the future of work. Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing solutions. In addition to launching the pilot of ADP Assist for our clients, we also launched the pilot of our new Agent Assist embedding Gen AI in the flow of work for ADP Associates. So far, we have enabled our call summarization capability to select associates. Thanks to this Agent Assist feature, those service associates no longer need to spend time writing up case notes after client calls, which should make our associates more effective and also allow us to quickly aggregate real-time client feedback to continuously improve our products. We are also piloting Agent Assist real-time guidance for our associates to help them with support content and guided workflows and to more easily share their accumulated knowledge in a way that's customized to individual client cases. We are excited to continue working toward additional Agent Assist features to help our implementation and service associates deliver better, faster service and to help our client satisfaction scores continue to reach new record levels. Our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients through our global scale, and in Q1, we expanded on this advantage. In August, we extended our leading global footprint by acquiring the payroll business of BTR, our longtime partner in Sweden. Acquisitions like this strengthen our multi-country payroll ecosystem while also positioning us to grow a local HCM business in countries with attractive growth prospects. In Q1, we launched Roll in Ireland, representing the beginning of an expansion into the European market, where we believe an AI-based payroll app coupled with our existing on the ground ecosystem will allow us to expand our SMB business outside the U.S. And during Q1, we also announced plans to deepen our existing partnership with Workday to deliver enhanced global payroll compliance and HR for the many clients we jointly serve around the world. Partnerships like this reflect our long-standing commitment to provide the personalization and overall experience our clients desire. Before turning it over to Don, I wanted to highlight a couple milestones in two of our businesses. Our suite of workforce management solutions, sometimes referred to as time and labor management, reached more than 125,000 clients in the first quarter, benefiting from a double-digit growth rate these last few years. Scheduling and precisely tracking time has become more important for employers over recent years in order to meet evolving legislative requirements, and we look forward to continuing to invest in our workforce management solutions to drive higher client attach rates. We also now serve more than 150,000 retirement services clients, which is up more than 20% from the 125,000 clients we served at the end of fiscal 2022. We anticipate growth for our retirement services business will remain strong in the years ahead as the provisions of the SECURE Act 2.0 and additional state mandates continue to phase in and as companies of all sizes continue to recognize the importance of positioning their workers well for their eventual retirement. I'm proud of our start to fiscal 2024 with both strong financial results and meaningful strategic progress. Our roadmap for the months ahead is keeping us incredibly busy. And with this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to recognize our associates across sales, service, implementation and technology whose efforts and outstanding performance are positioning us to consistently deliver for our clients and our shareholders. Thank you, all. With that, I'll turn it over to Don.\nDon McGuire: Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some more color on our results for the quarter and update you on our fiscal '24 outlook. Overall, we had a solid Q1 and are not making changes to our consolidated outlook, but there are some moving pieces I'll cover. Let me start with Employer Services. ES segment revenue increased 9% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic constant currency basis, ahead of our expectations. As Maria shared, ES new business bookings had a solid start with especially strong growth in September. The demand environment is stable, our pipelines are healthy, and we are on track for our 4% to 7% growth guidance. Our ES retention did decline slightly in Q1 versus the prior year, but that was slightly better than we expected. At this point, we are maintaining our outlook for a 50 basis point to 70 basis point decline in full year retention, which continues to embed an expectation for small business losses to increase due to higher out of business rates. But if recent trends continue, then we would hope to outperform that range. ES pays per control growth was in line with our expectation in Q1. It decelerated modestly to 2%, and we expect this very gradual deceleration to continue in the coming quarters and are maintaining our outlook for 1% to 2% growth for the full year. Client funds interest revenue increased in line with our expectation in Q1, but we're raising our full year outlook based on the latest forward yield curve, which result in a modest increase in average yield to 2.9% from our prior expectation of 2.8%. We now expect client funds interest revenue as well as the net impact from our client funds extended strategy to be up $35 million from our prior outlook. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar strengthened, representing a drag relative to our prior fiscal '24 revenue outlook. In total, our strong Q1 ES revenue growth combined with higher than expected client's funds revenue for the rest of the year effectively offset the adverse FX movement and we're maintaining our fiscal '24 ES revenue growth range of 7% to 8%. Our ES margin increased 220 basis points in Q1, driven by both operating leverage and contribution from client's funds interest revenue. For the full year, we are raising our fiscal '24 outlook to now anticipate an increase of 150 basis points to 170 basis points, which reflects the benefit of higher yields, partially offset by higher spend on Gen AI projects and usage, as well as a small amount of dilution from our recent acquisitions. Moving on to the PEO. We had 3% revenue growth driven by 2% growth in average worksite employees in Q1. As Maria mentioned earlier, our PEO bookings growth was solid, but pays for control growth continued to slow and was lower than expected, particularly for clients in the professional services and tech industries. This resulted in a slightly softer Q1 worksite employee count than we were anticipating. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2024 PEO revenue growth of 3% to 4% with growth in average worksite employees of 2% to 3%. Our PEO sales pipelines are healthy and we continue to forecast their worksite employee growth gradually ramping in the back half of fiscal '24. PEO margin decreased 90 basis points in Q1 which is more than we had planned. The decline was primarily driven by a lower workers' compensation reserve release benefit as well as higher selling expenses. We now expect PEO margin to be down between 50 basis points and 100 basis points in fiscal '24 with the continued assumption for higher selling expenses as well as year-over-year headwind from a lower workers' compensation reserve release benefit than we experienced in fiscal '23. Putting it all together, there is no change to our consolidated outlook, but I would like to share some color on cadence. In Q2, our client funds balanced growth will lightly impact the payroll tax deferral that we had in our average balance for the past two years, which creates some grow over pressure on our client's funds balance and will result in more modest ES margin expansion in Q2 than other quarters this year as well as a modest revenue impact. As a result, we expect consolidated revenue growth to moderate before accelerating slightly in the back half. And we expect adjusted EBIT margin to be down slightly before ramping in the back half of the year. This was already contemplated in our guidance at the outset of the year. So again, no change to our consolidated guidance. We continue to forecast fiscal '24 consolidated revenue growth of 6% to 7% with our adjusted EBIT margin expanding by 60 basis points to 80 basis points. We still expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '24 to be around 23% and we anticipate adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12%. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSamad Samana: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first just want to double-click on the PEO side. I think that, the information you gave helps to understand some of what happened in the revised guidance, but maybe just help us understand what's giving that back half ramp confidence, especially, as you expect pays per control in the kind of broader macro to continue to decelerate. Where should we get the acceleration in the PEO WSEs? Is it purely based on bookings ramping? Is it based on an expectation that the base will stabilize? Maybe just dig into that a little bit further because they're moving in different directions.\nMaria Black: You bet. So, good morning, Samad. It's Maria here. I thought I'd kind of break down your question with respect to the PEO, call it, double-click. So I'll start by commenting on the first quarter. So, I've mentioned, we did see deceleration in PEO pays per control. So as Don mentioned in the opening comments, that is a byproduct of what we're seeing in the pressure with respect to, as you know, that business tends to skew more into professional services technology. The pays per control deceleration is happening at a faster clip in those cohorts than the broader base. And so said differently, the pays per control growth in the PEO is decelerating faster than we expected and faster specifically in those cohorts. So in terms of the contributions, that is the contribution to the deceleration or the new guide to worksite employee growth that we're seeing in the first quarter. We did have strong bookings in PEO in the first quarter. That said, it did come in slightly below where we had hoped for, so it was still higher than overall employer services. It was a good quarter for the PEO and this is now the third quarter in a row that we've seen strength in bookings in the PEO. And that's important to note because really the strength in PEO bookings is what ultimately will yield the reacceleration that you're asking about in the back half. That coupled with kind of what we're seeing in retention. So while retention is stable and stabilizing inside the PEO, it isn't back to the high growth levels that we saw, call it, a couple of years ago in the last year or so, and as such as those compares continue to lap coupled with retention continuing to accelerate, if you will versus stabilize. We will see contributions from retention, we'll see more contributions from bookings and that's really why we anticipate the worksite employee guide for the year that we've given.\nSamad Samana: Great. And Maria, I actually had a follow-up for you as well on the international side.\nMaria Black: Yeah.\nSamad Samana: After seeing the rollout of the product into Ireland. And I'm just curious, how should we think about the expansion beyond the U.S.? I know ADP already has a presence and it's a meaningful contributor to revenue, but just should we think about international maybe being an offset to some of the slowdown that we're seeing in U.S. revenue? Just how should we think about the cadence and impact as you move more international with your core HCM solutions versus just helping U.S. employers that already had an international presence?\nMaria Black: Yeah. Absolutely. So I'll speak to Roll, which is what I commented on in the opening comments. So we did roll out, no pun (ph) unintended, our roll offering into Ireland. And it is an exciting bit for us, albeit it's very early days, right? It's actually only been a couple of weeks. But we're excited about it because it's the first of many countries where we intend on taking the, call it, very down market offering into our various countries throughout international. And it's really about marrying that product with what we see as still potentially greenfield opportunity within our international space and really leveraging the ecosystem that we have, that's everything from distribution to all the services call it around, the offers in various countries. So we're very excited about that. Now, in terms of the overall growth contributions in the short term of rolling out Roll into Ireland, I would say they're negligible. I would say even Roll over time this year, I think it would be, not a meaningful contributor to bookings. To me, I think this is really about a long-term investment that we're making across international and what we see as a continued opportunity for us. So you kind of mentioned is this companies that have a presence in Europe, that exist in the U.S. with folks working in or call it in international? And the answer is, this is both of that coupled also with a lot of our, what I would say, best-of-breed offerings in international. So we see growth opportunity really across the board in international and that's everything from the down market, which we're going after now with this new product offering of Roll. So we see it in the SMB space, we see it in our best-of-breed space and we also see it in our global MNC space. So really excited about the long-term growth opportunity that continues to be international. And while on international, I thought I would just mention because it's important to note, we did have a very strong quarter with respect to international, albeit that quarter is obviously off of a compare Q1 of last year that was less favorable, but it is on the heels of what was a very strong fourth quarter finish in international. And so, all the way around, I continue to be incredibly excited and optimistic about what it is that we can go accomplish and continue to build in our international offering.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So, Maria, I was hoping if you can comment on just how you're seeing the overall macro situation evolve and maybe how that may affect demand? And if you can specifically unpack that within the ES segment, maybe talk about some of the areas that came in better than you expected versus any areas that may have been lighter or downtick versus the prior quarter.\nMaria Black: Absolutely. Good morning, Bryan. So happy to comment on what we saw in the first quarter with respect to the overall performance of bookings, but also the demand. So I'll kind of start with the overall performance. I mentioned in the opening comments, we did see strength, continued strength in our down market, so really excited about that. Also saw tremendous strength in our compliance solutions offering. So think of it as all the stuff that hits compliance tax, things of that nature. So we're pleased with what we saw with respect to new business bookings. Those are the two that really outperformed. And it's exciting to see because really that entire down market offering and that's everything from our run offering to retirement services, insurance services, we continue to see tremendous strength there. We saw that all of last year and definitely the finish last year, and it makes me happy because it's a lot of the places that, well, good performance makes me happy regardless, but it's a lot of the places where we've been making meaningful investments both in the product as well as the distribution. So excited to see the continued performance there and the outperformance. The overall results do keep us in line with our full year guide. So excited to confirm that again here today. In terms of the overall demand environment and I feel like I've been saying this quarter-to-quarter, but we're not really seeing any major changes in demand. Demand is still strong, demand is still healthy. We see that in our bookings results. There are all sorts of other indicators that we look at in terms of pipelines, in the up-market, in the mid-market, certainly in the down-market. We're looking at things such as new appointments and kind of activity, excuse me, activity measures to really give us a guide on whether demand is strong. And I would tell you pipelines are healthy year-on-year and certainly activity is healthy. And so we don't see a big demand change again this quarter. In fact, it\u2019s kind of the opposite stepping into the quarter on the heels of a strong September. We feel really good about where our pipeline sit year-on-year, which again is giving us the confidence in the full year guide. As always though, Bryan, we continue to keep an eye on the macro. We continue to keep an eye on our global space and international and making sure that we're understanding both any macroeconomic changes coupled with any demand environment that could shift given everything kind of going on in the world, if you will. So that's the current story on kind of pipelines demand in the quarter.\nDon McGuire: Yeah, maybe..\nBryan Bergin: Okay.\nDon McGuire: If I could add a couple of comments on the macro, certainly macro continues to be pretty positive. Unemployment rates continue to be near decade lows here in the United States. Unemployment rates around the world continue to be quite low. The discussion about whether or not we're going to be in a recession, I think the odds are now not for a recession. So soft landing is pretty much what is being anticipated. Interest rates are expected to have peaked here in the US. So I think all things considered, things are pretty positive. I think the one area that we put in our original guidance for the year and that we continue to look at is our guidance had in fact contemplated a slowing and pays per control growth. Maria mentioned that and talked about that in the PEO business, but we are confident. We are still seeing growth, albeit, we are seeing growth at a slower pace than we had previously. But once again, that was fully contemplated in our original guide for the year.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Don. My follow-up on the PEO. So heard you, the bookings are a little bit lighter than you expected to start, but you're also calling out, I think higher selling expenses impacting the PEO margins here year-over-year. So can you -- maybe talk about the puts and takes there driving that dynamic?\nMaria Black: Specifically on PEO margins? I will let Don\u2026\nDon McGuire: No. But I think originally, Bryan, you mentioned bookings were lighter than expected. I think our bookings came in \u2013 our bookings came in pretty good, as Maria has mentioned.\nMaria Black: Yeah. I think he's referencing the comment I made around PEO bookings was slightly lighter than expected. By the way, still higher than ES, which we expect to be the case throughout the balance of the year. So that's the kind of nuanced [Multiple Speakers]\nBryan Bergin: So the question there, you're also citing higher selling expenses impacting the PEO margin. So it seems like there's a bit of a disconnect there. Just trying to understand that.\nDon McGuire: Yeah. So we had planned the year, we talked about the growth being stronger in the second half in bookings, sorry, in margins than in the first half. And certainly we have seen some investment and some higher selling expenses and we'll see in the first half than we will in the second half, but nothing really surprising. A little bit off, but certainly we're in line with what we expected.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask just a couple of quick follow-up questions. First, I think the comment was made that you're still anticipating a bit worse performance in terms of out of business rates on a go-forward basis, but to-date those have been a little bit better than you had anticipated. Can you help provide some detail as to what you're seeing, why you think we're seeing better, survival rates, and kind of the things you may be looking at as indicators that could get worse on a go-forward basis.\nDon McGuire: Yeah. Demand continues to be strong in the economy overall, and I think that's supporting what tends to be this view that we're not going to enter into a recession. At best, there's going to be a soft landing. So I think that strong demand environment, particularly consumer demand is keeping small business afloat. So when you also look at what we're seeing in terms of new business formations, there seems to be continued strength in new business formations. So generally I would say that the environment, irrespective of the higher interest rates, the environment continues to be favorable for small business, and I think that's translating itself into what looks to be lower out of business than contemplated now. We have continued, as we said in our original guide, and as we will reiterate or update here today, we have continued to think that we will see a little bit more normalization in other business. So we'd have contemplated that, but we think we are getting closer to where we think we're going to plateau or hit the bottom there. So I think we're very close, and once again, I think it just comes back to demand environment. It tends to be supporting the economy more broadly and more generally and small businesses benefiting from that as well.\nMaria Black: Yeah. I think if I may, I think the only thing I would add is that it's still very early in the year, right? So when I think about retention, we did have a record level in fiscal '23. We were near that record level a year before, we were at that record level the year before that. And so we've had this tremendous strength. And I think Don is spot on in terms of all the reasons from a macro perspective that we've had that strength in terms of client retention. And so as that normalizes, we believe it's still prudent for us to have the retention guide that we have, which is really a byproduct of how we planned the year in the back half. So I think I got the question last quarter and so I'll answer it proactively this quarter, which is, are we just being conservative? And I think the answer to that question is, it's still early in the year. And so, if we do continue to outperform retention in the way that we outperformed in the first quarter, we hope that we will outperform for the full year. It's just early to take away that conservatism sitting here just, three short months into a very long year.\nJames Faucette: Yeah. And then, I want to go back to kind of a headline related question. You saw that -- you saw or you indicated that you'd seen kind of a 25,000 sequential improvement in retirement services and -- for clients, you alluded to some state mandates there, particularly around SECURE Act 2.0. Can you talk a little bit about what state mandates you've seen or that may be impacting that business or how long before we start to see benefit in their retirement services, post a new state mandate? So maybe we can help track headlines and anticipate like, how big of an impact any new requirements may have?\nMaria Black: Absolutely. So I think I've spoken quite a bit to retirement services as well as the SECURE Act over the last year or so. And I will tell you, I was excited to report the new milestone today in part because that business continues to show strength, but also because it's a business that I know is adding tremendous value into the world of work. And so, it is an exciting time. It does come as a byproduct of the offering, the investments we've made into the offering, and also these state mandates, some of which are anchored into the SECURE Act at the federal level, some of which are anchored state by state. Candidly, I could probably spend an hour with you and go state by state in terms of all the various mandates. What we see over the next year or so is the threshold of companies that need to comply with the state mandates starts to creep into, call it, the further down market, if not the micro market. And so, as all these states, a lot of them being on the West Coast, if you're looking for headlines tracking states like California, as they continue to pull down at what level do you need to comply with the state mandates and/or the SECURE Act, the more opportunity we will have to ensure that we're helping our clients to solve for this piece, keep them compliant. But again, back to doing good in the world, it's also something that's bringing the value to each one of these employees that are engaging with these clients, so.\nJames Faucette: Great. Appreciate that color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Good morning. Just want to ask about the decline in PEO. Looking at the employee base of PEO declining versus not necessarily the case, looks like almost the opposite in the employer services. So just trying to think about the trends. And does, typically the trend you see in PEO bleed into employer services and why maybe it's been a little bit weaker for pays per control there in PEO versus employer?\nMaria Black: Yeah. So just to clarify, pays per control in PEO is actually higher. We don't give that number, but it is actually higher than employer services. So I think the first piece suggests is that the bases are actually just different, right? So if you look at the pays per control across the broader ADP, it's really a reflection of a mix of industries. As I mentioned earlier, the PEO tends to skew, by design, by the way, for the offering. It's really -- the offering is the most valuable if you will to the cohorts that we offer it to, which tends to be more professional services, tech-oriented companies that want to offer employers or their employees benefits of choice, if you will, to be employers of choice. And so that skews that base slightly differently than the overall. And what we're seeing within the PEO base is a delineation between those cohorts and the rest of the base, if you will. So we cited it in the prepared remarks, but the deceleration that is happening at the PEO is still a byproduct of within that base having professional services and tech decelerating at a faster clip than the rest of the base. So to answer your question, does it bleed across? I think, we're already hearing these headlines in the market in terms of -- and we see it within our own ADP Research Institute data with respect to professional services and tech hiring being in a different position than the rest of the market. So I think I would suggest it's already been bleeding across. If you look at the last couple of quarters of that, by the way, that also tracks BLS data shows the same thing. You see it in wages. And so all of that to suggest, I would say, the trend we're seeing in the PEO is already in the macro, but the bases are slightly different, which is why you would feel it, the impact of it perhaps more significantly in the PEO PPC than you would in the broader PPC. That was a mouthful, by the way.\nBryan Keane: No that was helpful though. Thanks for that clarification. And then the other question I just had is the strength you saw in the ES new bookings especially in September and the way the pipeline looks, but you're not changing the total outlook of 4% to 7%. Just trying to figure out -- do you feel like you guys are maybe trending if things hold trending above the guidance range for bookings given the strength you saw in September in the pipeline and for SMB strength in the quarter?\nMaria Black: Yeah. What I would offer is that I'm incredibly pleased with the results in the first quarter, especially on the heels of what was an incredible finish last year. And so the pattern that we saw in the first quarter and the strength in September is not a typical of the pattern we see in this -- the first quarter on the heels of an incredibly strong fourth quarter. And so I am excited about the first quarter results, I am excited about the strength in September. But the excitement is actually less about, call it, the finish in September and more about what we see on the year-on-year demand environment, what we see in activity, what we see stepping into this next quarter. And that does give us confidence into our full year guide at that 4% to 7%. What I would also offer though is it's a long year, and when you think about where the skewing, if you will, or the contribution of new business bookings happens for us on a full-year basis, it is in that third and fourth quarter. I'll much call it larger than the first and second quarter. And so we believe it's prudent to given the line of sight that we have today, just a quarter in. But we feel confident in the guide, we're excited about the performance, we're excited about how we're stepping into the quarter. The second quarter that is but we also still have an entire year ahead of us.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Thanks for taking the questions.\nMaria Black: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Could you give us your latest thoughts on the competitive environment in PEO and how that's sort of evolving over time? I think there's somewhat slower than historical growth across the industry. Are there any signs that the market is, saturated with providers or is there any competitive overlay to PEO performance?\nMaria Black: I would suggest that the PEO ASO conversation, if you will, or PEO HR outsourcing offerings kind of continues. I don't know that there's anything new to report, Ramsey. I think from my vantage point, it's always been a very competitive environment. We all have slightly different PEOs from one another. I think we talked a lot about ours today and the way that it skews to professional services and tech. I think you have others that skew to different types of industries. You also have other PEOs that perhaps are a bit more down market. We tend to skew a little bit more upmarket than some. And so I think all the PEOs look slightly different. I think we all know our models are also not identical in terms of how we actually go-to-market, whether it's through the strength that we have in the competitive advantage of being able to have ADP's client base contribute about 50% of those upgrades. So I think how we go to market, our models, never mind the models of, you know, fully insured to self-insured, et cetera. I think similar trends are within the ASO offerings, or some refer to them as HRO offerings. And so I think within there, you also have various models and various go-to-markets in terms of the, some competitors perhaps some -- have some flexibility or more movement between ASO and PEO than I think we've cited in the past. And so, I think all that to suggest I think the competitive environment is about the same and remains. I think I\u2019m optimistic and expect growth in both our PEO bookings as well as our HRO and ASO offerings throughout the balance of this year. And so I think we remain very, very excited and optimistic about the growth of those -- all of our HR outsourcing offerings, both in this year as well as the long term.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. Okay. And a follow-up for me. Could I ask you to revisit those comments you made about higher selling expenses in PEO? What does that mean exactly? And also just I wanted to make sure I understood that, Don mentioned that, there's some expectations those may continue, but they're still, in essence, sort of a non-recurring step up in expenses. It's not a permanent step up in, in expenses in the segment.\nDon McGuire: Yeah. We saw higher selling expenses in Q1 for the PEO, and we expect to see higher selling expenses year-over-year in the first half, but we do think that that's going to settle down into the second half. So we're not looking at the kind of growth that we saw last year. I think we commented quite extensively on the many, many salespeople we added into the business last year and had great success and allowed us to finish the year the way we did. So those folks are in place. So we are continuing to add some sellers. We will add though, most of those sellers in the first half and it's important to also, I think, call out here that, what we are seeing with our sellers is that we are getting much better retention within the seller community. So we are hoping and expecting to benefit from the improved tenure that we should see from the selling organization as we go through the balance of this year.\nRamsey El-Assal: I got it. So it's headcount-related primarily. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks so much.\nMaria Black: Yeah. I think it's a timing thing. I think that's the\u2026\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. Just staying on PEO for a second and maybe if we can just refresh a little bit here. I'm just thinking back to the Analyst Day two years ago, we thought it was a medium-term 10% to 12% grower. Now it's 2% to 3% at the moment. There was definitely some post-COVID normalization. But maybe just, Maria, if you want to take us back through the dynamics in terms of just how the business has evolved from your perspective? And is there a potential path back to double-digit growth for this business if the macro is a little bit more cooperative?\nMaria Black: Yeah. So I'll let Don kind of speak to the medium-term targets and kind of the path back. But I think, from my vantage point, and I said it earlier today, that step one is the continued reacceleration of bookings. And so this is the third quarter that we're pleased and we did have a solid contribution of PEO bookings to the overall bookings picture in this quarter. That was the case last quarter, it was the case the quarter before. And I think the reason that I go to that is not just because it's the piece that will accelerate the growth and path us back to what our long-term goals and medium-term targets are with -- for that business. I think it's also because it speaks to the demand environment. It speaks to the value proposition and the strength of that offering that still exists in the market. And so I think that's a big piece of it. I think step two is the continued acceleration -- reacceleration of retention. So I mentioned that retention has been stable and as we reaccelerate retention back into that growth, that also will contribute to obviously the revenue. And then last but not least, Jason, you mentioned it, the macro headwinds, and I think I talked about the last couple quarters, how that's been the post-pandemic, call it, nuances that impacted that business. I think we talked a lot about the renewal over the last couple of quarters. Now we're seeing these trends in PPC. My view would be that all of the post-pandemic waves that have been, call it, flowing through the PEO and all the variables that make up that model. We're still seeing some of those case in point being really call it the reversion of what we saw several quarters ago, which was when professional services and tech was in a massive hiring boom, now we're seeing the opposite of that, right? So I think we still have some of these waves, kind of shuffling through or whether or going through -- flowing through the PEO. And if and when the macro changes with respect to that, that certainly will help reaccelerate that business as well. So in terms of the path back, I'll let Don kind of speak to the medium-term targets.\nDon McGuire: Yeah. I think Maria covered it very comprehensively there. I would say that when we established the mid-term targets, I think a lot of things have changed since then, certainly the inflation environment and that we've seen in particular and Maria just mentioned professional services and technology, we saw incredible growth in those sector -- in those segments and growth beyond what we thought we -- or what we had predicted in the mid-term targets or spoken to. I think now we're seeing some reversion. We do, though, continue to be incredibly positive about that business. We think it definitely has a place, and we think that we will make our way back. But as Maria also said, it's a little bit early to forecast when we think we're going to get back to some of those mid-term target growth areas that we had discussed.\nJason Kupferberg: Understood. That's good color. Just a follow-up on float yield. It looks like it was actually a tick down slightly quarter-over-quarter here in Q1, amid a higher rate environment. But just curious what the callouts might be there.\nDanyal Hussain: Hey, Jason. That just relates to the mix between short-term and extended in long. So in Q4, we were a little more levered to overnight partly because of this debt ceiling issue. We had to be deliberately skewed shorter duration. But in a typical Q1, we would generally have a lower short portfolio. And so there is seasonality in the average balance wouldn't read much into it. The year-over-year number is a much more relevant metric.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi. Good morning. Forgive me, if I'm asking another clarification on the PEO side. Just --what the -- was the slight softness in the bookings also related to the PS and tech sectors and also with the pays per control within PEO, is that more of a healthcare participation issue or just labor weakness in those sectors?\nMaria Black: I really apologize, you actually blipped out during the first part of your question. Would you mind just repeating -- yeah, there was a word missing so.\nTien-Tsin Huang: No, I probably didn't ask it very well. Just wanted to make sure the bookings softness on the PEO side, was that also in the professional services and tech sectors. And then also just on the pays of control, was is a labor weakness or health care participation?\nMaria Black: Yeah. Listen, so I'm glad you're asking this question actually because I just want to reiterate, we were very pleased with our PEO bookings. And so there wasn't softness, there was strength and growth in the PEO quarter bookings. In terms of how we skewed the year, it was slightly lighter than we had positioned our planning, which is why it contributes the way that it does to the overall worksite employee growth. But, it's -- again, the worksite employee deceleration is really about the PPC story. And so I just want to reiterate, we were actually very pleased with the quarter from a PEO bookings perspective. In terms of the industries, I think it's a mix. I think we continue to see the PEO execute with respect to the industries that we target which tend to be into those categories. As it relates to, this comment around kind of within the PEO, the deceleration that is happening faster in professional services and technology versus the broader base of the PEO. Again, I don't want to give kind of the numbers of what that is, but it isn't like the entire base is sitting in professional services. It's just that subset, if you will, of the base. And it is really, again, kind of triangulate to the macro that we're seeing and the same type of data coming out of ADP Research Institute, out of the BLS and it's really about hiring. So it's less about, call it, layoffs and it's really where the professional services and tech industries, we're doing massive hiring, call it, a year ago, six quarters ago, it's really a lack of hiring that's happening in those businesses. Did I answer that question?\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yeah. [indiscernible]\nDanyal Hussain: Tien-Tsin, just on the participation piece of it, the pay per control wouldn't be impacted by participation rate, but the reported revenue would be. So to the extent, workers are taking plans, cheaper plans or fewer plans. And there's a little bit of that. You do see it in the revenue per WSE, but the WSEs themselves wouldn't be impacted.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you, Danny. I didn't ask it. Well, that's perfect. That's what I was looking for. On the -- we get questions around pricing as well. That's why I was asking about the participation side of things and if there's a difference there, it sounds like it isn't. On the international front, just my quick follow-up. Just I think Sweden was the call-out in terms of acquisition. Why is Sweden important to own? Just I'm not as familiar with some of the specific countries that you're targeting. And I'm curious if this is just part of a -- maybe a broader plan to aggregate international payroll.\nMaria Black: Absolutely. So listen, I have to take this question because I think you may know that I'm actually -- I was born and partially raised in Sweden. So I thought it was prudent to make it the very first country that I announced. I'm actually completely kidding. This was obviously well in motion before my time. But I -- it sounds like I might be closer to Sweden than you are. And for us, it is an exciting time for us. We have had this partnership with BTR for quite some time for us to be able to acquire the payroll business of BTR is exciting because the Nordics are growing, and this does give us a physical footprint into Sweden, which allows us to expand further into the Nordics and really take advantage of the growth trajectory of those economies. So this is obviously payroll, but also in the beyond payroll opportunities that we will have in years to come. So really excited about the acquisition not just because it's near and dear to my heart, but moreover because the Nordics represent growth, and it's exciting to think about us having a physical presence there.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. You called out strength in ES bookings, particularly in the small business market with RUN. Could you provide some texture into the bookings trends you saw in mid-market with Workforce Now and then up-market with enterprise? And any insights you have into international bookings in the quarter would also be appreciated.\nMaria Black: Absolutely. So yes, we did have great strength in the down markets, kind of moving on up in the mid-market. Certainly, we have continued solid demand in the mid-market. That's inclusive of our Workforce Now platform. It's also inclusive of our HR outsourcing offering. So I spoke a bit about the ASO models, the HRO models earlier in that mid-market also support -- is supported by the PEO. So we do see continued demand from the mid-market. I think the way I always think about it is not getting any easier for companies in that mid-market to navigate being an employer today. And so we expect continued strong mid-market growth. I think in the up-market, since you asked about the enterprise space, one of the call-outs we made last quarter was about the strength that we saw in our next-generation HCM offering, and we did see that strength continue into this quarter, which we think is fantastic. We also see strength in the pipeline in that space year-on-year. So excited about what we're hearing from our clients, the sentiments around the offerings that we have in the enterprise space. And then I think I touched a little bit on international earlier, but our international business did grow nicely in the first quarter. Again, it was a benefit of a little bit of an easier compare year-on-year. But we also had, as I mentioned, a really strong finish and a strong fiscal '23 in our international business. Again, what I measure is partly the results. But as I think about the look forward, it's really about pipelines and what I would say, our international pipeline year-on-year have a fair amount higher than they did a year ago, which gives us the strength to really feel good about our international bookings to remain healthy through fiscal '24.\nDavid Togut: Thanks for that. Just as a quick follow-up, Don, you called out part of the 90 basis point margin decline in PEO being traced to a difficult comparison on workers' compensation reserve adjustments a year ago. Can you quantify for us how large those were as we think through the margin comparisons for Q2, Q3 and Q4 of FY \u201824 in PEO?\nDon McGuire: Yeah. So as we've had very favorable reserve releases over the last number of years and somebody called out last year in the K, you would have seen the favorability there. So just to be clear, we are still seeing favorable reserve releases, but we are not seeing -- we didn't see the reserve release to the extent that we did Q1 to Q1 of the prior year. So the numbers will be in the Q, but it's about $6.2 million less than it was in the prior year. So that's the quantification of it. And if you kind of translate that into the margin, it's about 60 bps to 90 bps -- 60 bps of the 90 bps decline comes from the lower reserve release. Now once again, we think that we're going to continue to see reserve releases and were favorable as the actuaries get back to us and let us know what's happening, but we're not seeing any underlying changes or large changes that would lead us to be any less optimistic about seeing continued releases in the reserve.\nDanyal Hussain: And David, sorry, just to clarify, it was a $6 million benefit in Q1, which is about $8 million less than the prior year.\nDavid Togut: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. At HR tech, you got to see a lot of your new solutions, particularly focused on, the AI Assisted solutions. Maria, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about your philosophy with regards to, which solutions you would charge additional for -- how are you thinking about monetization? And then I've got a follow-up in terms of process improvement.\nMaria Black: Sure. Good morning, Mark. I'm pretty excited about all of our new solutions that you would have seen at HR tech. So I think I'll take a minute to kind of think or talk through how I'm thinking about Gen AI in general, and then I'll tell you how I'm thinking about monetization because I think it'll make more sense on the other side. But when I think about Gen AI, I think it will impact everything. So the answer is it's going to be everywhere impacting everything that we do across the entire client life cycle. So it's about how we develop products. That's everything from developer co-pilot types of tools that everyone is talking about. It's about how Gen AI will be embedded into our product, it's about how we go-to-market and modern seller stuff that I've spoken about for years and how we actually have the ability now leveraging Gen AI to actually acquire clients. And then the most obvious being how we serve them, how we implement them, how we become more productive and make our clients more productive as we serve our clients. And so when I think about Gen AI, and I think most -- everyone has probably likened it to things like whether it's software or the Internet, I think my answer to you is, it will be in everything that we do and in the fabric of who we become. And so in terms of the monetization side, I think it's less about, charging a PEPM (ph) on a per feature. So let's say, you know, some of the things I talked about today, which probably doesn't sound that exciting, like report writing or if you look at the earnings release document, you'll see in there a job description that's pulled in the screenshot showing roles. So these things probably don't sound that exciting, but they're pretty exciting because they are the seeds of innovation, as I used earlier to really show what -- how Gen AI will interact with everything that we do kind of in the fabric. So said differently, Mark, like, I don't think we're going to be charging separately to get Gen AI job description written or Gen AI report written. I think it's really about continuing our innovation journey to do all the things we've always done, which is really about becoming more productive. It's about solving things for our clients and making them more productive. And I think that, to me, the fruits of that labor really end up in new business bookings, and they end up in retention. And so that's not to suggest that there may not be things. But I don't think it's really to me about $0.50 PEPM (ph) here and there. To me, it's really about the innovation journey we've been on. This just allows us to do it at a faster clip. And I'm really optimistic and excited about the things that we're seeing. In terms of other things that we're measuring, we actually have the entire organization rallied to engage in these tools. We actually have some goals that we put out there in terms of -- by the end of the year, how many of our associates that set across sales and implementation and service and technology that are engaging with these tools. Right now, they're sitting at already above 10% of our base of associates that have the ability to touch these tools are already playing with them. I would tell you our entire sales organization are comping up a bit because the digital sales or inside sales where we've deployed a lot of these modern tools over years, have an ability to become that much more productive, engaging our new prospects and new sales. So as you can probably tell, like, I literally could go on and on and on, but I think my answer to you is, it will be everywhere across the entire client life cycle that we have, and I'm very optimistic about the long-term implications of this on all the major metrics that make up this great business model.\nMark Marcon: That's terrific. And then with regards to just the productivity enhancement. I mean, particularly when we think about service and implementation, from a longer-term perspective, can you describe how much more efficient you think your service personnel could become? And how much efficiency you could end up gaining there and the implications from, continuous margin improvement as you continue to go along that journey? I know it's early days, but just how are you thinking about that?\nMaria Black: Yeah. Listen, Mark, it is early days, right? And that's not for a lack of scoping it, right? So we have had because it's not as though we haven't had all of these business cases over many years on how to become more productive, and we've had machine learning and regular AI in our house for a long time. And this does give us a step change to that innovation. But it's still too early. I think to sit on an earnings call and commit numbers, but that's not for a lack of internally having scoping and line of sight to what we believe are pretty exciting goals for us to go chase. And again, some of those goals have existed for a long time, but now we have technology that I'm hopeful that we can actually finally crack the code on some of these really big enhancements that we see. But certainly, productivity is a big piece of it. I know I talked today about Agent Assist and this idea of call summarization. Again, it probably doesn't sound that exciting. But for someone who used to sit on the other side of that, you see whether it's a prospect call or a client call gets summarized and recapped into a very quick format that's usable. These are, hours and minutes of time. even on the seller side, we actually are launching something called rapid pre-call planning, and I think about the hours I used to spend 27 years ago, researching a company to get myself ready to go in and have a conversation with a prospect that brings value, enabling our sellers to have all of that productivity. So I think it's -- again, it's too early to give you exact hundreds of millions of dollars of types of quantifications. But arguably, we are actively looking kind of case by case and really picking the ones that we believe sequentially will be the most accretive to drive the most amount of productivity, the most amount of value back to our shareholders, but candidly, the most amount of value to our clients.\nMark Marcon: Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have time for one more question and that question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Wurtzel: Great. Good morning, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in here. Just on the launch of the construction vertical software. I'm just wondering, is this sort of part of a bigger shift to develop more vertical specific HCM solutions for your clients? I understand, construction may be a more complex vertical, but wondering if there's more of a vertical specific strategy that could develop beyond the construction vertical. Thanks.\nMaria Black: So I'd like -- what you're suggesting, and I think the answer to that could be yes. And I think when I think about -- back to selling 27 years ago, I used to sell construction companies and the complexity that they have has always existed and candidly, a lot of the features and functionality that we have and are now pulling together to make it an actual solution for that vertical existed many years ago. And that's everything from things like job costing, obviously, compliance and reporting, think about certified, compliance type of reports for payroll, things of that nature. And so it's really about pulling it together and marrying it with a service organization that can support the complexity of that vertical. I think that, to me, is a big change, so we did add some features. But a lot of these things we've had, and we pulled them together and we're marrying it with the ecosystem of a dedicated service org that can actually really help the construction industry and this vertical saw the complexity of being in that industry. So I think what I would offer is that, it's an exciting time for the construction industry, specifically for our Workforce Now clients, and I see this, just as you suggested at the beginning of other places that we could pull together our existing tech with a dedicated type of service model and solve real challenges in the business for various verticals.\nScott Wurtzel: Got it. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Just wondering if you can give an update on sort of Next Gen HCM and Next Gen Payroll, attach rates and how we're sort of trending there, relative to expectations?\nMaria Black: So Next Gen Payroll. That was the question?\nScott Wurtzel: Both.\nMaria Black: Both. Okay, just making sure I heard it right. So I think I touched base really quickly on Next Gen HCM. And I think I noted to the excitement that we have that we continue to see the strength in the Next Gen HCM offering into Q1. So we had a strong fourth quarter. What I would suggest is that we actually brought in more Next Gen HCM in the first quarter than we saw all of last fiscal year. But again, one quarter these things can sometimes be lumpy. But I think for me, it's really about the sentiment. And so we recently had an Analyst Day. We had a handful of our clients up on stage that, shared with us the impact, the platform is making for them. And as you would remember, we spent a lot of our discussions over the last year talking about scaling implementation, on-boarding the backlog. So pretty exciting to see some of that backlog that's no longer backlog on stage, speaking to the value proposition, and that's supported by continued strength which means our sellers are excited to continue to sell the Next Gen HCM offering. So I think that's all very, very positive. Similarly, we have continued focus in the Next Gen Payroll. And so what I would offer there as we continue to make headway. So as it's not deployed across the entire mid-market. We continue to make headway to solve for more complex features, things of that nature, that will pull it further into the upmarket of the mid-market. But as you know, that Next Gen Payroll engine is also what's attached to the Roll offer. So the other exciting part about that engine is it is the thing that's taking us into the SMB space internationally. So I feel really excited about the road map for that offering and the contributions that it's making into the mid-market today, but also into the long-term growth of the company internationally.\nScott Wurtzel: Awesome. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Maria Black for closing remarks.\nMaria Black: Yeah. So thank you, Michelle. And listen, it's hard for me not to sit here and reflect on a year ago. And so I was driving in this morning and feeling candidly a bit nostalgic because it's exactly one year ago that Carlos and I sat here and announced the transition of me becoming CEO of this amazing company. And so I'm incredibly nostalgic and proud today. I'm proud of our first quarter results. I'm really proud of the execution of the team, both with respect to the results, but also with everything that you heard in terms of the progress we are making on a very cohesive and strong strategic outline and priorities. But mostly what I would offer is that I remain incredibly humbled by the -- over 60,000 associates that I've had an opportunity to engage with over the last year who continue to make this company everything that it is and absolutely amazing. And I just wanted to say that I'd like to thank each and every one of them for inspiring me every day. So with that, that is the conclusion of our call and until we meet again.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Maria Black",
            "content": "Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported strong first quarter results, including 7% revenue growth and 12% adjusted EPS growth, and we made significant progress on the three strategic priorities we shared with you last quarter. Let me begin by quickly reviewing some of our financial highlights from the first quarter. We had a solid start to the year in Employer Services new business bookings with record-level volume for first quarter which was supported by a particularly strong September. Among our best performers were our small business portfolio and our compliance-oriented solutions. Overall demand in HCM has remained steady and we maintained a healthy new business pipeline at the end of the quarter across our business. Our Employer Services retention rate once again exceeded our expectations. Although, retention declined slightly versus the prior year, including in our small business portfolio, we continued to see resilience among our clients. More importantly, our overall NPS scores reached a new all-time high, positioning us to stay near these historically high retention levels. Our Employer Services pays per control growth was 2% for the first quarter as our clients continued to add employees at a pace that is gradually slowing. And our PEO revenue growth of 3% in the quarter was relatively stable versus last quarter, reflecting solid PEO bookings performance offset by deceleration in PEO pays per control growth. Don will speak to our updated guidance in a moment, but the demand environment for PEO as well as our other outsourcing services remains healthy. Moving on, we made meaningful progress across all three of our strategic priorities that we outlined last quarter. Let me start with an update on some actions we took in Q1 to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. First, we began embedding Gen AI features into our products. In Q1, we integrated Gen AI into Roll to further enhance its conversational UI and make it even easier for small business owners to quickly obtain customized Payroll and HR guidance. We also began rolling out ADP Assist, which delivers insights and recommendations to make complex HR work simple. We've enabled ADP Assist for select Workforce Now clients, beginning with a Report Assist feature that allows practitioners to easily extract the insights they're looking for. We look forward to continuing to build on the live feature set of ADP Assist to further enhance the experiences of both HR practitioners and employees. We also had some exciting product developments beyond AI. Our clients tell us they need personalized experiences and deep integrations to help them manage the complexity of running a business today. To help address this, we recently launched a new product called API Central, which enables businesses to easily and securely connect their ADP workforce data across systems using pre-populated APIs and tools. This is a feature our clients have increasingly asked for and we have already seen a strong uptake. In Q1, we complemented the launch of API Central with the acquisition of Sora, an intelligent workflow automation and data integration tool. Sora's unique capabilities will allow our clients to automate people processes by unifying various applications such as HR, IT, CRM, and more, creating a smarter and easier-to-use experience for our clients. In Q1, we also launched ADP Workforce Now for construction, a comprehensive offering designed to help clients with the unique payroll and HCM needs of the construction industry. This verticalized offering combines tailored Workforce Now capabilities and reporting with a team of dedicated specialists for the construction industry. While ADP has always served clients across the full spectrum of industries, construction stood out to us as a vertical with enough complexity to warrant a more tailored solution, and we're excited to further strengthen our offering in the mid-market. We also announced the launch of our corporate venture capital fund earlier this month, leading with best-in-class HCM technology requires that we stay attuned to the frontier of HCM innovation. And now, in addition to the organic efforts we are developing in ADP Ventures, we will invest in and partner with early-stage startups to strengthen our core business our core business and to extend into natural adjacencies. Two of our early investments focus on improving lifestyle benefits to drive associate engagement in simplifying the incredibly complex leave management process that businesses and their workers have to address. We're excited to build on these partnerships and develop new ones. Overall, Q1 was a very busy quarter on the product front with much of the work we're doing representing seeds of innovation that will position us to continue shaping the future of work. Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing solutions. In addition to launching the pilot of ADP Assist for our clients, we also launched the pilot of our new Agent Assist embedding Gen AI in the flow of work for ADP Associates. So far, we have enabled our call summarization capability to select associates. Thanks to this Agent Assist feature, those service associates no longer need to spend time writing up case notes after client calls, which should make our associates more effective and also allow us to quickly aggregate real-time client feedback to continuously improve our products. We are also piloting Agent Assist real-time guidance for our associates to help them with support content and guided workflows and to more easily share their accumulated knowledge in a way that's customized to individual client cases. We are excited to continue working toward additional Agent Assist features to help our implementation and service associates deliver better, faster service and to help our client satisfaction scores continue to reach new record levels. Our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients through our global scale, and in Q1, we expanded on this advantage. In August, we extended our leading global footprint by acquiring the payroll business of BTR, our longtime partner in Sweden. Acquisitions like this strengthen our multi-country payroll ecosystem while also positioning us to grow a local HCM business in countries with attractive growth prospects. In Q1, we launched Roll in Ireland, representing the beginning of an expansion into the European market, where we believe an AI-based payroll app coupled with our existing on the ground ecosystem will allow us to expand our SMB business outside the U.S. And during Q1, we also announced plans to deepen our existing partnership with Workday to deliver enhanced global payroll compliance and HR for the many clients we jointly serve around the world. Partnerships like this reflect our long-standing commitment to provide the personalization and overall experience our clients desire. Before turning it over to Don, I wanted to highlight a couple milestones in two of our businesses. Our suite of workforce management solutions, sometimes referred to as time and labor management, reached more than 125,000 clients in the first quarter, benefiting from a double-digit growth rate these last few years. Scheduling and precisely tracking time has become more important for employers over recent years in order to meet evolving legislative requirements, and we look forward to continuing to invest in our workforce management solutions to drive higher client attach rates. We also now serve more than 150,000 retirement services clients, which is up more than 20% from the 125,000 clients we served at the end of fiscal 2022. We anticipate growth for our retirement services business will remain strong in the years ahead as the provisions of the SECURE Act 2.0 and additional state mandates continue to phase in and as companies of all sizes continue to recognize the importance of positioning their workers well for their eventual retirement. I'm proud of our start to fiscal 2024 with both strong financial results and meaningful strategic progress. Our roadmap for the months ahead is keeping us incredibly busy. And with this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to recognize our associates across sales, service, implementation and technology whose efforts and outstanding performance are positioning us to consistently deliver for our clients and our shareholders. Thank you, all. With that, I'll turn it over to Don. You bet. So, good morning, Samad. It's Maria here. I thought I'd kind of break down your question with respect to the PEO, call it, double-click. So I'll start by commenting on the first quarter. So, I've mentioned, we did see deceleration in PEO pays per control. So as Don mentioned in the opening comments, that is a byproduct of what we're seeing in the pressure with respect to, as you know, that business tends to skew more into professional services technology. The pays per control deceleration is happening at a faster clip in those cohorts than the broader base. And so said differently, the pays per control growth in the PEO is decelerating faster than we expected and faster specifically in those cohorts. So in terms of the contributions, that is the contribution to the deceleration or the new guide to worksite employee growth that we're seeing in the first quarter. We did have strong bookings in PEO in the first quarter. That said, it did come in slightly below where we had hoped for, so it was still higher than overall employer services. It was a good quarter for the PEO and this is now the third quarter in a row that we've seen strength in bookings in the PEO. And that's important to note because really the strength in PEO bookings is what ultimately will yield the reacceleration that you're asking about in the back half. That coupled with kind of what we're seeing in retention. So while retention is stable and stabilizing inside the PEO, it isn't back to the high growth levels that we saw, call it, a couple of years ago in the last year or so, and as such as those compares continue to lap coupled with retention continuing to accelerate, if you will versus stabilize. We will see contributions from retention, we'll see more contributions from bookings and that's really why we anticipate the worksite employee guide for the year that we've given. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So I'll speak to Roll, which is what I commented on in the opening comments. So we did roll out, no pun (ph) unintended, our roll offering into Ireland. And it is an exciting bit for us, albeit it's very early days, right? It's actually only been a couple of weeks. But we're excited about it because it's the first of many countries where we intend on taking the, call it, very down market offering into our various countries throughout international. And it's really about marrying that product with what we see as still potentially greenfield opportunity within our international space and really leveraging the ecosystem that we have, that's everything from distribution to all the services call it around, the offers in various countries. So we're very excited about that. Now, in terms of the overall growth contributions in the short term of rolling out Roll into Ireland, I would say they're negligible. I would say even Roll over time this year, I think it would be, not a meaningful contributor to bookings. To me, I think this is really about a long-term investment that we're making across international and what we see as a continued opportunity for us. So you kind of mentioned is this companies that have a presence in Europe, that exist in the U.S. with folks working in or call it in international? And the answer is, this is both of that coupled also with a lot of our, what I would say, best-of-breed offerings in international. So we see growth opportunity really across the board in international and that's everything from the down market, which we're going after now with this new product offering of Roll. So we see it in the SMB space, we see it in our best-of-breed space and we also see it in our global MNC space. So really excited about the long-term growth opportunity that continues to be international. And while on international, I thought I would just mention because it's important to note, we did have a very strong quarter with respect to international, albeit that quarter is obviously off of a compare Q1 of last year that was less favorable, but it is on the heels of what was a very strong fourth quarter finish in international. And so, all the way around, I continue to be incredibly excited and optimistic about what it is that we can go accomplish and continue to build in our international offering. Absolutely. Good morning, Bryan. So happy to comment on what we saw in the first quarter with respect to the overall performance of bookings, but also the demand. So I'll kind of start with the overall performance. I mentioned in the opening comments, we did see strength, continued strength in our down market, so really excited about that. Also saw tremendous strength in our compliance solutions offering. So think of it as all the stuff that hits compliance tax, things of that nature. So we're pleased with what we saw with respect to new business bookings. Those are the two that really outperformed. And it's exciting to see because really that entire down market offering and that's everything from our run offering to retirement services, insurance services, we continue to see tremendous strength there. We saw that all of last year and definitely the finish last year, and it makes me happy because it's a lot of the places that, well, good performance makes me happy regardless, but it's a lot of the places where we've been making meaningful investments both in the product as well as the distribution. So excited to see the continued performance there and the outperformance. The overall results do keep us in line with our full year guide. So excited to confirm that again here today. In terms of the overall demand environment and I feel like I've been saying this quarter-to-quarter, but we're not really seeing any major changes in demand. Demand is still strong, demand is still healthy. We see that in our bookings results. There are all sorts of other indicators that we look at in terms of pipelines, in the up-market, in the mid-market, certainly in the down-market. We're looking at things such as new appointments and kind of activity, excuse me, activity measures to really give us a guide on whether demand is strong. And I would tell you pipelines are healthy year-on-year and certainly activity is healthy. And so we don't see a big demand change again this quarter. In fact, it\u2019s kind of the opposite stepping into the quarter on the heels of a strong September. We feel really good about where our pipeline sit year-on-year, which again is giving us the confidence in the full year guide. As always though, Bryan, we continue to keep an eye on the macro. We continue to keep an eye on our global space and international and making sure that we're understanding both any macroeconomic changes coupled with any demand environment that could shift given everything kind of going on in the world, if you will. So that's the current story on kind of pipelines demand in the quarter. Specifically on PEO margins? I will let Don\u2026 Yeah. I think he's referencing the comment I made around PEO bookings was slightly lighter than expected. By the way, still higher than ES, which we expect to be the case throughout the balance of the year. So that's the kind of nuanced [Multiple Speakers] Yeah. I think if I may, I think the only thing I would add is that it's still very early in the year, right? So when I think about retention, we did have a record level in fiscal '23. We were near that record level a year before, we were at that record level the year before that. And so we've had this tremendous strength. And I think Don is spot on in terms of all the reasons from a macro perspective that we've had that strength in terms of client retention. And so as that normalizes, we believe it's still prudent for us to have the retention guide that we have, which is really a byproduct of how we planned the year in the back half. So I think I got the question last quarter and so I'll answer it proactively this quarter, which is, are we just being conservative? And I think the answer to that question is, it's still early in the year. And so, if we do continue to outperform retention in the way that we outperformed in the first quarter, we hope that we will outperform for the full year. It's just early to take away that conservatism sitting here just, three short months into a very long year. Absolutely. So I think I've spoken quite a bit to retirement services as well as the SECURE Act over the last year or so. And I will tell you, I was excited to report the new milestone today in part because that business continues to show strength, but also because it's a business that I know is adding tremendous value into the world of work. And so, it is an exciting time. It does come as a byproduct of the offering, the investments we've made into the offering, and also these state mandates, some of which are anchored into the SECURE Act at the federal level, some of which are anchored state by state. Candidly, I could probably spend an hour with you and go state by state in terms of all the various mandates. What we see over the next year or so is the threshold of companies that need to comply with the state mandates starts to creep into, call it, the further down market, if not the micro market. And so, as all these states, a lot of them being on the West Coast, if you're looking for headlines tracking states like California, as they continue to pull down at what level do you need to comply with the state mandates and/or the SECURE Act, the more opportunity we will have to ensure that we're helping our clients to solve for this piece, keep them compliant. But again, back to doing good in the world, it's also something that's bringing the value to each one of these employees that are engaging with these clients, so. Yeah. So just to clarify, pays per control in PEO is actually higher. We don't give that number, but it is actually higher than employer services. So I think the first piece suggests is that the bases are actually just different, right? So if you look at the pays per control across the broader ADP, it's really a reflection of a mix of industries. As I mentioned earlier, the PEO tends to skew, by design, by the way, for the offering. It's really -- the offering is the most valuable if you will to the cohorts that we offer it to, which tends to be more professional services, tech-oriented companies that want to offer employers or their employees benefits of choice, if you will, to be employers of choice. And so that skews that base slightly differently than the overall. And what we're seeing within the PEO base is a delineation between those cohorts and the rest of the base, if you will. So we cited it in the prepared remarks, but the deceleration that is happening at the PEO is still a byproduct of within that base having professional services and tech decelerating at a faster clip than the rest of the base. So to answer your question, does it bleed across? I think, we're already hearing these headlines in the market in terms of -- and we see it within our own ADP Research Institute data with respect to professional services and tech hiring being in a different position than the rest of the market. So I think I would suggest it's already been bleeding across. If you look at the last couple of quarters of that, by the way, that also tracks BLS data shows the same thing. You see it in wages. And so all of that to suggest, I would say, the trend we're seeing in the PEO is already in the macro, but the bases are slightly different, which is why you would feel it, the impact of it perhaps more significantly in the PEO PPC than you would in the broader PPC. That was a mouthful, by the way. Yeah. What I would offer is that I'm incredibly pleased with the results in the first quarter, especially on the heels of what was an incredible finish last year. And so the pattern that we saw in the first quarter and the strength in September is not a typical of the pattern we see in this -- the first quarter on the heels of an incredibly strong fourth quarter. And so I am excited about the first quarter results, I am excited about the strength in September. But the excitement is actually less about, call it, the finish in September and more about what we see on the year-on-year demand environment, what we see in activity, what we see stepping into this next quarter. And that does give us confidence into our full year guide at that 4% to 7%. What I would also offer though is it's a long year, and when you think about where the skewing, if you will, or the contribution of new business bookings happens for us on a full-year basis, it is in that third and fourth quarter. I'll much call it larger than the first and second quarter. And so we believe it's prudent to given the line of sight that we have today, just a quarter in. But we feel confident in the guide, we're excited about the performance, we're excited about how we're stepping into the quarter. The second quarter that is but we also still have an entire year ahead of us. You bet. Thank you. I would suggest that the PEO ASO conversation, if you will, or PEO HR outsourcing offerings kind of continues. I don't know that there's anything new to report, Ramsey. I think from my vantage point, it's always been a very competitive environment. We all have slightly different PEOs from one another. I think we talked a lot about ours today and the way that it skews to professional services and tech. I think you have others that skew to different types of industries. You also have other PEOs that perhaps are a bit more down market. We tend to skew a little bit more upmarket than some. And so I think all the PEOs look slightly different. I think we all know our models are also not identical in terms of how we actually go-to-market, whether it's through the strength that we have in the competitive advantage of being able to have ADP's client base contribute about 50% of those upgrades. So I think how we go to market, our models, never mind the models of, you know, fully insured to self-insured, et cetera. I think similar trends are within the ASO offerings, or some refer to them as HRO offerings. And so I think within there, you also have various models and various go-to-markets in terms of the, some competitors perhaps some -- have some flexibility or more movement between ASO and PEO than I think we've cited in the past. And so, I think all that to suggest I think the competitive environment is about the same and remains. I think I\u2019m optimistic and expect growth in both our PEO bookings as well as our HRO and ASO offerings throughout the balance of this year. And so I think we remain very, very excited and optimistic about the growth of those -- all of our HR outsourcing offerings, both in this year as well as the long term. Yeah. I think it's a timing thing. I think that's the\u2026 Yeah. So I'll let Don kind of speak to the medium-term targets and kind of the path back. But I think, from my vantage point, and I said it earlier today, that step one is the continued reacceleration of bookings. And so this is the third quarter that we're pleased and we did have a solid contribution of PEO bookings to the overall bookings picture in this quarter. That was the case last quarter, it was the case the quarter before. And I think the reason that I go to that is not just because it's the piece that will accelerate the growth and path us back to what our long-term goals and medium-term targets are with -- for that business. I think it's also because it speaks to the demand environment. It speaks to the value proposition and the strength of that offering that still exists in the market. And so I think that's a big piece of it. I think step two is the continued acceleration -- reacceleration of retention. So I mentioned that retention has been stable and as we reaccelerate retention back into that growth, that also will contribute to obviously the revenue. And then last but not least, Jason, you mentioned it, the macro headwinds, and I think I talked about the last couple quarters, how that's been the post-pandemic, call it, nuances that impacted that business. I think we talked a lot about the renewal over the last couple of quarters. Now we're seeing these trends in PPC. My view would be that all of the post-pandemic waves that have been, call it, flowing through the PEO and all the variables that make up that model. We're still seeing some of those case in point being really call it the reversion of what we saw several quarters ago, which was when professional services and tech was in a massive hiring boom, now we're seeing the opposite of that, right? So I think we still have some of these waves, kind of shuffling through or whether or going through -- flowing through the PEO. And if and when the macro changes with respect to that, that certainly will help reaccelerate that business as well. So in terms of the path back, I'll let Don kind of speak to the medium-term targets. I really apologize, you actually blipped out during the first part of your question. Would you mind just repeating -- yeah, there was a word missing so. Yeah. Listen, so I'm glad you're asking this question actually because I just want to reiterate, we were very pleased with our PEO bookings. And so there wasn't softness, there was strength and growth in the PEO quarter bookings. In terms of how we skewed the year, it was slightly lighter than we had positioned our planning, which is why it contributes the way that it does to the overall worksite employee growth. But, it's -- again, the worksite employee deceleration is really about the PPC story. And so I just want to reiterate, we were actually very pleased with the quarter from a PEO bookings perspective. In terms of the industries, I think it's a mix. I think we continue to see the PEO execute with respect to the industries that we target which tend to be into those categories. As it relates to, this comment around kind of within the PEO, the deceleration that is happening faster in professional services and technology versus the broader base of the PEO. Again, I don't want to give kind of the numbers of what that is, but it isn't like the entire base is sitting in professional services. It's just that subset, if you will, of the base. And it is really, again, kind of triangulate to the macro that we're seeing and the same type of data coming out of ADP Research Institute, out of the BLS and it's really about hiring. So it's less about, call it, layoffs and it's really where the professional services and tech industries, we're doing massive hiring, call it, a year ago, six quarters ago, it's really a lack of hiring that's happening in those businesses. Did I answer that question? Absolutely. So listen, I have to take this question because I think you may know that I'm actually -- I was born and partially raised in Sweden. So I thought it was prudent to make it the very first country that I announced. I'm actually completely kidding. This was obviously well in motion before my time. But I -- it sounds like I might be closer to Sweden than you are. And for us, it is an exciting time for us. We have had this partnership with BTR for quite some time for us to be able to acquire the payroll business of BTR is exciting because the Nordics are growing, and this does give us a physical footprint into Sweden, which allows us to expand further into the Nordics and really take advantage of the growth trajectory of those economies. So this is obviously payroll, but also in the beyond payroll opportunities that we will have in years to come. So really excited about the acquisition not just because it's near and dear to my heart, but moreover because the Nordics represent growth, and it's exciting to think about us having a physical presence there. Absolutely. So yes, we did have great strength in the down markets, kind of moving on up in the mid-market. Certainly, we have continued solid demand in the mid-market. That's inclusive of our Workforce Now platform. It's also inclusive of our HR outsourcing offering. So I spoke a bit about the ASO models, the HRO models earlier in that mid-market also support -- is supported by the PEO. So we do see continued demand from the mid-market. I think the way I always think about it is not getting any easier for companies in that mid-market to navigate being an employer today. And so we expect continued strong mid-market growth. I think in the up-market, since you asked about the enterprise space, one of the call-outs we made last quarter was about the strength that we saw in our next-generation HCM offering, and we did see that strength continue into this quarter, which we think is fantastic. We also see strength in the pipeline in that space year-on-year. So excited about what we're hearing from our clients, the sentiments around the offerings that we have in the enterprise space. And then I think I touched a little bit on international earlier, but our international business did grow nicely in the first quarter. Again, it was a benefit of a little bit of an easier compare year-on-year. But we also had, as I mentioned, a really strong finish and a strong fiscal '23 in our international business. Again, what I measure is partly the results. But as I think about the look forward, it's really about pipelines and what I would say, our international pipeline year-on-year have a fair amount higher than they did a year ago, which gives us the strength to really feel good about our international bookings to remain healthy through fiscal '24. Sure. Good morning, Mark. I'm pretty excited about all of our new solutions that you would have seen at HR tech. So I think I'll take a minute to kind of think or talk through how I'm thinking about Gen AI in general, and then I'll tell you how I'm thinking about monetization because I think it'll make more sense on the other side. But when I think about Gen AI, I think it will impact everything. So the answer is it's going to be everywhere impacting everything that we do across the entire client life cycle. So it's about how we develop products. That's everything from developer co-pilot types of tools that everyone is talking about. It's about how Gen AI will be embedded into our product, it's about how we go-to-market and modern seller stuff that I've spoken about for years and how we actually have the ability now leveraging Gen AI to actually acquire clients. And then the most obvious being how we serve them, how we implement them, how we become more productive and make our clients more productive as we serve our clients. And so when I think about Gen AI, and I think most -- everyone has probably likened it to things like whether it's software or the Internet, I think my answer to you is, it will be in everything that we do and in the fabric of who we become. And so in terms of the monetization side, I think it's less about, charging a PEPM (ph) on a per feature. So let's say, you know, some of the things I talked about today, which probably doesn't sound that exciting, like report writing or if you look at the earnings release document, you'll see in there a job description that's pulled in the screenshot showing roles. So these things probably don't sound that exciting, but they're pretty exciting because they are the seeds of innovation, as I used earlier to really show what -- how Gen AI will interact with everything that we do kind of in the fabric. So said differently, Mark, like, I don't think we're going to be charging separately to get Gen AI job description written or Gen AI report written. I think it's really about continuing our innovation journey to do all the things we've always done, which is really about becoming more productive. It's about solving things for our clients and making them more productive. And I think that, to me, the fruits of that labor really end up in new business bookings, and they end up in retention. And so that's not to suggest that there may not be things. But I don't think it's really to me about $0.50 PEPM (ph) here and there. To me, it's really about the innovation journey we've been on. This just allows us to do it at a faster clip. And I'm really optimistic and excited about the things that we're seeing. In terms of other things that we're measuring, we actually have the entire organization rallied to engage in these tools. We actually have some goals that we put out there in terms of -- by the end of the year, how many of our associates that set across sales and implementation and service and technology that are engaging with these tools. Right now, they're sitting at already above 10% of our base of associates that have the ability to touch these tools are already playing with them. I would tell you our entire sales organization are comping up a bit because the digital sales or inside sales where we've deployed a lot of these modern tools over years, have an ability to become that much more productive, engaging our new prospects and new sales. So as you can probably tell, like, I literally could go on and on and on, but I think my answer to you is, it will be everywhere across the entire client life cycle that we have, and I'm very optimistic about the long-term implications of this on all the major metrics that make up this great business model. Yeah. Listen, Mark, it is early days, right? And that's not for a lack of scoping it, right? So we have had because it's not as though we haven't had all of these business cases over many years on how to become more productive, and we've had machine learning and regular AI in our house for a long time. And this does give us a step change to that innovation. But it's still too early. I think to sit on an earnings call and commit numbers, but that's not for a lack of internally having scoping and line of sight to what we believe are pretty exciting goals for us to go chase. And again, some of those goals have existed for a long time, but now we have technology that I'm hopeful that we can actually finally crack the code on some of these really big enhancements that we see. But certainly, productivity is a big piece of it. I know I talked today about Agent Assist and this idea of call summarization. Again, it probably doesn't sound that exciting. But for someone who used to sit on the other side of that, you see whether it's a prospect call or a client call gets summarized and recapped into a very quick format that's usable. These are, hours and minutes of time. even on the seller side, we actually are launching something called rapid pre-call planning, and I think about the hours I used to spend 27 years ago, researching a company to get myself ready to go in and have a conversation with a prospect that brings value, enabling our sellers to have all of that productivity. So I think it's -- again, it's too early to give you exact hundreds of millions of dollars of types of quantifications. But arguably, we are actively looking kind of case by case and really picking the ones that we believe sequentially will be the most accretive to drive the most amount of productivity, the most amount of value back to our shareholders, but candidly, the most amount of value to our clients. So I'd like -- what you're suggesting, and I think the answer to that could be yes. And I think when I think about -- back to selling 27 years ago, I used to sell construction companies and the complexity that they have has always existed and candidly, a lot of the features and functionality that we have and are now pulling together to make it an actual solution for that vertical existed many years ago. And that's everything from things like job costing, obviously, compliance and reporting, think about certified, compliance type of reports for payroll, things of that nature. And so it's really about pulling it together and marrying it with a service organization that can support the complexity of that vertical. I think that, to me, is a big change, so we did add some features. But a lot of these things we've had, and we pulled them together and we're marrying it with the ecosystem of a dedicated service org that can actually really help the construction industry and this vertical saw the complexity of being in that industry. So I think what I would offer is that, it's an exciting time for the construction industry, specifically for our Workforce Now clients, and I see this, just as you suggested at the beginning of other places that we could pull together our existing tech with a dedicated type of service model and solve real challenges in the business for various verticals. So Next Gen Payroll. That was the question? Both. Okay, just making sure I heard it right. So I think I touched base really quickly on Next Gen HCM. And I think I noted to the excitement that we have that we continue to see the strength in the Next Gen HCM offering into Q1. So we had a strong fourth quarter. What I would suggest is that we actually brought in more Next Gen HCM in the first quarter than we saw all of last fiscal year. But again, one quarter these things can sometimes be lumpy. But I think for me, it's really about the sentiment. And so we recently had an Analyst Day. We had a handful of our clients up on stage that, shared with us the impact, the platform is making for them. And as you would remember, we spent a lot of our discussions over the last year talking about scaling implementation, on-boarding the backlog. So pretty exciting to see some of that backlog that's no longer backlog on stage, speaking to the value proposition, and that's supported by continued strength which means our sellers are excited to continue to sell the Next Gen HCM offering. So I think that's all very, very positive. Similarly, we have continued focus in the Next Gen Payroll. And so what I would offer there as we continue to make headway. So as it's not deployed across the entire mid-market. We continue to make headway to solve for more complex features, things of that nature, that will pull it further into the upmarket of the mid-market. But as you know, that Next Gen Payroll engine is also what's attached to the Roll offer. So the other exciting part about that engine is it is the thing that's taking us into the SMB space internationally. So I feel really excited about the road map for that offering and the contributions that it's making into the mid-market today, but also into the long-term growth of the company internationally. Yeah. So thank you, Michelle. And listen, it's hard for me not to sit here and reflect on a year ago. And so I was driving in this morning and feeling candidly a bit nostalgic because it's exactly one year ago that Carlos and I sat here and announced the transition of me becoming CEO of this amazing company. And so I'm incredibly nostalgic and proud today. I'm proud of our first quarter results. I'm really proud of the execution of the team, both with respect to the results, but also with everything that you heard in terms of the progress we are making on a very cohesive and strong strategic outline and priorities. But mostly what I would offer is that I remain incredibly humbled by the -- over 60,000 associates that I've had an opportunity to engage with over the last year who continue to make this company everything that it is and absolutely amazing. And I just wanted to say that I'd like to thank each and every one of them for inspiring me every day. So with that, that is the conclusion of our call and until we meet again."

            "name": "Don McGuire",
            "content": "Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some more color on our results for the quarter and update you on our fiscal '24 outlook. Overall, we had a solid Q1 and are not making changes to our consolidated outlook, but there are some moving pieces I'll cover. Let me start with Employer Services. ES segment revenue increased 9% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic constant currency basis, ahead of our expectations. As Maria shared, ES new business bookings had a solid start with especially strong growth in September. The demand environment is stable, our pipelines are healthy, and we are on track for our 4% to 7% growth guidance. Our ES retention did decline slightly in Q1 versus the prior year, but that was slightly better than we expected. At this point, we are maintaining our outlook for a 50 basis point to 70 basis point decline in full year retention, which continues to embed an expectation for small business losses to increase due to higher out of business rates. But if recent trends continue, then we would hope to outperform that range. ES pays per control growth was in line with our expectation in Q1. It decelerated modestly to 2%, and we expect this very gradual deceleration to continue in the coming quarters and are maintaining our outlook for 1% to 2% growth for the full year. Client funds interest revenue increased in line with our expectation in Q1, but we're raising our full year outlook based on the latest forward yield curve, which result in a modest increase in average yield to 2.9% from our prior expectation of 2.8%. We now expect client funds interest revenue as well as the net impact from our client funds extended strategy to be up $35 million from our prior outlook. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar strengthened, representing a drag relative to our prior fiscal '24 revenue outlook. In total, our strong Q1 ES revenue growth combined with higher than expected client's funds revenue for the rest of the year effectively offset the adverse FX movement and we're maintaining our fiscal '24 ES revenue growth range of 7% to 8%. Our ES margin increased 220 basis points in Q1, driven by both operating leverage and contribution from client's funds interest revenue. For the full year, we are raising our fiscal '24 outlook to now anticipate an increase of 150 basis points to 170 basis points, which reflects the benefit of higher yields, partially offset by higher spend on Gen AI projects and usage, as well as a small amount of dilution from our recent acquisitions. Moving on to the PEO. We had 3% revenue growth driven by 2% growth in average worksite employees in Q1. As Maria mentioned earlier, our PEO bookings growth was solid, but pays for control growth continued to slow and was lower than expected, particularly for clients in the professional services and tech industries. This resulted in a slightly softer Q1 worksite employee count than we were anticipating. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2024 PEO revenue growth of 3% to 4% with growth in average worksite employees of 2% to 3%. Our PEO sales pipelines are healthy and we continue to forecast their worksite employee growth gradually ramping in the back half of fiscal '24. PEO margin decreased 90 basis points in Q1 which is more than we had planned. The decline was primarily driven by a lower workers' compensation reserve release benefit as well as higher selling expenses. We now expect PEO margin to be down between 50 basis points and 100 basis points in fiscal '24 with the continued assumption for higher selling expenses as well as year-over-year headwind from a lower workers' compensation reserve release benefit than we experienced in fiscal '23. Putting it all together, there is no change to our consolidated outlook, but I would like to share some color on cadence. In Q2, our client funds balanced growth will lightly impact the payroll tax deferral that we had in our average balance for the past two years, which creates some grow over pressure on our client's funds balance and will result in more modest ES margin expansion in Q2 than other quarters this year as well as a modest revenue impact. As a result, we expect consolidated revenue growth to moderate before accelerating slightly in the back half. And we expect adjusted EBIT margin to be down slightly before ramping in the back half of the year. This was already contemplated in our guidance at the outset of the year. So again, no change to our consolidated guidance. We continue to forecast fiscal '24 consolidated revenue growth of 6% to 7% with our adjusted EBIT margin expanding by 60 basis points to 80 basis points. We still expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '24 to be around 23% and we anticipate adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12%. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A. Yeah, maybe.. If I could add a couple of comments on the macro, certainly macro continues to be pretty positive. Unemployment rates continue to be near decade lows here in the United States. Unemployment rates around the world continue to be quite low. The discussion about whether or not we're going to be in a recession, I think the odds are now not for a recession. So soft landing is pretty much what is being anticipated. Interest rates are expected to have peaked here in the US. So I think all things considered, things are pretty positive. I think the one area that we put in our original guidance for the year and that we continue to look at is our guidance had in fact contemplated a slowing and pays per control growth. Maria mentioned that and talked about that in the PEO business, but we are confident. We are still seeing growth, albeit, we are seeing growth at a slower pace than we had previously. But once again, that was fully contemplated in our original guide for the year. No. But I think originally, Bryan, you mentioned bookings were lighter than expected. I think our bookings came in \u2013 our bookings came in pretty good, as Maria has mentioned. Yeah. So we had planned the year, we talked about the growth being stronger in the second half in bookings, sorry, in margins than in the first half. And certainly we have seen some investment and some higher selling expenses and we'll see in the first half than we will in the second half, but nothing really surprising. A little bit off, but certainly we're in line with what we expected. Yeah. Demand continues to be strong in the economy overall, and I think that's supporting what tends to be this view that we're not going to enter into a recession. At best, there's going to be a soft landing. So I think that strong demand environment, particularly consumer demand is keeping small business afloat. So when you also look at what we're seeing in terms of new business formations, there seems to be continued strength in new business formations. So generally I would say that the environment, irrespective of the higher interest rates, the environment continues to be favorable for small business, and I think that's translating itself into what looks to be lower out of business than contemplated now. We have continued, as we said in our original guide, and as we will reiterate or update here today, we have continued to think that we will see a little bit more normalization in other business. So we'd have contemplated that, but we think we are getting closer to where we think we're going to plateau or hit the bottom there. So I think we're very close, and once again, I think it just comes back to demand environment. It tends to be supporting the economy more broadly and more generally and small businesses benefiting from that as well. Yeah. We saw higher selling expenses in Q1 for the PEO, and we expect to see higher selling expenses year-over-year in the first half, but we do think that that's going to settle down into the second half. So we're not looking at the kind of growth that we saw last year. I think we commented quite extensively on the many, many salespeople we added into the business last year and had great success and allowed us to finish the year the way we did. So those folks are in place. So we are continuing to add some sellers. We will add though, most of those sellers in the first half and it's important to also, I think, call out here that, what we are seeing with our sellers is that we are getting much better retention within the seller community. So we are hoping and expecting to benefit from the improved tenure that we should see from the selling organization as we go through the balance of this year. Yeah. I think Maria covered it very comprehensively there. I would say that when we established the mid-term targets, I think a lot of things have changed since then, certainly the inflation environment and that we've seen in particular and Maria just mentioned professional services and technology, we saw incredible growth in those sector -- in those segments and growth beyond what we thought we -- or what we had predicted in the mid-term targets or spoken to. I think now we're seeing some reversion. We do, though, continue to be incredibly positive about that business. We think it definitely has a place, and we think that we will make our way back. But as Maria also said, it's a little bit early to forecast when we think we're going to get back to some of those mid-term target growth areas that we had discussed. Yeah. So as we've had very favorable reserve releases over the last number of years and somebody called out last year in the K, you would have seen the favorability there. So just to be clear, we are still seeing favorable reserve releases, but we are not seeing -- we didn't see the reserve release to the extent that we did Q1 to Q1 of the prior year. So the numbers will be in the Q, but it's about $6.2 million less than it was in the prior year. So that's the quantification of it. And if you kind of translate that into the margin, it's about 60 bps to 90 bps -- 60 bps of the 90 bps decline comes from the lower reserve release. Now once again, we think that we're going to continue to see reserve releases and were favorable as the actuaries get back to us and let us know what's happening, but we're not seeing any underlying changes or large changes that would lead us to be any less optimistic about seeing continued releases in the reserve."
